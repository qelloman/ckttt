abstract={Summary form only given. The energy efficiency of electronic circuits has dramatically improved over the past two decades. At the same time, computation, storage, and communication demands continue to grow with emerging wireless multimedia devices. In this inaugural Plenary Technology-Roundtable event, experts will discuss the opportunities to achieve the next order-of-magnitude reduction in energy consumption across various domains, including analog, digital, RF, and memory. The line between analog and digital continues to blur, as analog circuits are enhanced by applying digital corrections to compensate for increased analog component variability with process scaling. As well, digital will incorporate more analog to become more adaptive; for example, to optimize operating voltages at a fine-grain to match workloads and process variations. Memory circuits will need to use a system-level approach which requires bit-cell optimization, low-voltage operation with integrated regulators, 3D Through-Silicon Vias (TSV), and process optimization. RF transceivers will continue to trend toward highly-digital architectures. The role of process-technology innovation and CAD tools will also be discussed. Future process technology will deliver new transistor structures and higher-mobility channel materials for low-voltage digital circuits. TSVs will be important in reducing I/O power and the length of on-chip interconnects. For RF, integrated inductors and transformers with significantly lower resistance will be the challenge. Future CAD tools optimizing energy will focus on co-design of packaging, architecture, power sources, and antenna to provide the best system solution. Domain experts will challenge the distinguished panelists to suggest directions and help create a roadmap for next-generation energy-efficient electronics.},

pages={36-38}, 
abstract={Recently, a wearable body-sensor network realized continuous sleep monitoring by ExG (EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG) extraction from a sleeper's face. At least 14 sensors were placed on the face, and were managed by a network controller for sleep monitoring. However, the system was too bulky and heavy (127x63.5χ28mnf, 210g) to wear during sleep, and consumed high power (>;100mW). Another system used a CMOS IC sensor for smaller power consumption (5 to 10mW/sensor), but it was still inconvenient to wear due to its cumbersome size (49χ19χ6mnf). This paper presents a 5g sub-500μW compact sleep-monitoring system based on a low-power network controller and ExG sensors, and Planar Fashionable Circuit Board (P-FCB) technology. The entire sleep monitor operates on a 1.5 V 10mAh single tiny coin battery (φ=5.8mm, T=2.1 mm, 200mg) stacked on the controller chip. The power dissipation of 14 sensors and a controller is below 425 μW, which is <;1.5% of previ ous works. Its low power consumption is possible by the Linked-List Manager (LLM)-based protocol such as Adaptive Dual-Mode Control (ADMC) and Continuous Data Transmission (CDT), and low-swing clock and data transceivers.},

year={2011}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={44-45}, 
abstract={The use of closed-loop implantable telemetry devices is increasing as recent clinical studies have shown their efficiency and usefulness in detecting and treating various cardiac arrhythmias. In this paper, we present a single-chip closed-loop system providing closed-loop feedback of sensed cardiac patterns. This device promises more optimized stimulation parameters to cure rapid arrhythmias compared with open-loop devices. Our system incorporates more functionality comparing with the conventional micro-stimulators, yet consumes less power. It is powered by implanted rechargeable batteries periodically charged by radio-frequency (RF) coupling. This improvement of the powering system can prevent improper device operation or shutdown due to RF coupling and loading variations. Furthermore, this system eliminates the need for periodic surgery for battery replacement and improves quality of life of the patient. In this work, an implantable micro-stimulator SoC (IMSoC) is designed as cardiac defibrillator for remote delivery of power by means of coupled coils supplying power to a bio-implanted rechargeable battery. The IMSoC consists of a smart control circuit for power management, an RF-coupling power system for battery charging and 2 ultra-small rechargeable batteries as power supplies. The micro-stimulator circuit embedded in the IMSoC is externally powered and controlled by a single encoded RF carrier. Stimulus parameters, such as pulse width, amplitude, and frequency, can be programmed from the remote controller.},

title={A 660pW multi-stage temperature-compensated timer for ultra-low-power wireless sensor node synchronization}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={46-48}, 
abstract={Recent work in ultra-low-power sensor platforms has enabled a number of new applications in medical, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Due to their limited energy storage volume, these sensors operate with long idle times and ultra-low standby power ranging from 10s of nW down to 100s of pW. Since radio transmission is relatively expensive, even at the lowest reported power of 0.2mW, wireless communication between sensor nodes must be performed infrequently. Accurate measurement of the time interval between communication events (i.e. the synchronization cycle) is of great importance. Inaccuracy in the synchronization cycle time results in a longer period of uncertainty where sensor nodes are required to enable their radios to establish communication (Fig. 2.7.1), quickly making radios dominate the energy budget. Quartz crystal oscillators and CMOS harmonic oscillators exhibit very small sensitivity to supply voltage and temperature but cannot be used in the target application space since they operate at very high frequencies and exhibit power consumption that is several orders of magnitude larger (>;300nW) than the needed idle power. A gate-leakage-based timer was proposed that leveraged small gate leakage currents to achieve power consumption within the required budget (<; 1nW). However, this timer incurs high RMS jitter (1400ppm) and temperature sensitivity (0.16%/oC). A 150pW program-and-hold timer was proposed to reduce temperature sensitivity but its drifting clock frequency limits its use for synchronization. The quality of a timer is not captured well by RMS jitter since it ignores the averaging of jitter over multiple timer clock periods in a single synchronization cycle. Instead, we propose the uncertainty in a single synchronization cycle of length T as new metric and use this synchronization uncertainty (SU) to evaluate different timer approaches. The timer period is a random variable X(n), with mean and sigma, μ and σ. Given a synchronization cycle time T, consisting of N timer periods, we define SU as the standard deviation of T as given by √(T/μ) × σ, assuming X(n) is Gaussian. Note that a smaller clock period increases N and results in more averaging and a lower SU with fixed jitter (σ/μ).},

abstract={After the first-ever all-digital PLL (ADPLL) [1] for Bluetooth radios has proven benefits of CMOS scaling and integration, demonstrators for more challenging wireless standards have emerged [2-6]. In the ADPLL, however, the digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and time-to-digital converter (TDC) quantize the time and frequency tuning functions, respectively, which can lead to spurious tones and phase noise increase. As such, finite TDC resolution can distort data modu lation and spectral mask at near integer-N channels, while finite DCO step size can add far-out spurs and phase noise. Also, a major underreported issue is an injection pulling of the DCO due to harmonics of the digital activity at closely spaced frequencies, which can also create spurs. This work addresses all these problems and demonstrates RF performance matching that of the best-in-class traditional approaches.},

abstract={In this paper, a 2.5GHz fully differential tuned LNA with integrated T/R switch is designed in a High-K metal gate 32nm digital CMOS process, and packaged in an SoC-compatible flip-chip package. Reliability constraints of the package severely limit the ability to depopulate soldering bumps, and RF components must be designed taking the bump location into account. The LNA achieves a 3.5dB NF, -5dBm P1dB at 2.5GHz while drawing 11 mA from a 1.8V supply. LNA performance is enabled by use of a push-pull topology that exploits the equal strength of p and n transistors to improve linearity, use of nested coupled inductors (NCI) for low-noise input matching and to reduce area. The T/R switch handles 34dBm of power with an insertion loss of 1.1dB at 2.5GHz. T/R switch performance is enabled by reuse of LNA gate inductor to enable low RX mode loss, use of remote body-contact ed TX switch with high power handling and ESD protection for a transformer coupled PA.},

abstract={Phased-array receivers provide two major benefits over single-antenna receivers. Their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) doubles for each doubling in the number of elements, resulting in extended range. Secondly, interferers can be rejected in the spatial domain for increased link robustness. These arrays can be implemented by phase shifting and summing the signals from antenna elements with uniform spacing. For accurate interference rejection, a phase shifter with uniform phase steps and constant amplitude is desired. Several types of continuous-time phase shifters have been published, e.g. using injection locking, phase selection and vector modulation. This paper proposes a phased-array receiver architecture with a discrete-time vector modulator that takes advantage of the high linearity and good matching of switched-capacitor circuits, which are highly compatible with advanced CMOS. A simple charge redistribution circuit is presented that performs a rational approximation of the sine and cosine needed for the vector modulator weights.},

Described in this paper is a 14 bit dynamic hit logic scheme with an embedded 8K bit SRAM in IBM's 45nm SOI. The hit logic uses a "search-for-a-hit" scheme (i.e., XOR's followed by AND functions, pre-charged to a miss) to provide optimal performance, timing, and power. A custom microcode programmable Array-Built -In-Self-Test (ABIST) engine tests both the SRAM and hit logic function jointly, resulting in comprehensive "at-speed" test coverage to guarantee circuit functionality and timing margins. The SRAM is organized as a 64x15bx8W (way, or set) array and uses a 6T SRAM cell (1Read/1Write, 0.462μm2) in a "domino" hierarchal dual read bitline approach.},

abstract={State-of-the-art digital fractional-N PLLs intended for modern wireless systems make use of high-resolution and high-linearity time-to-digital converters (TDCs) in order to meet the stringent integral phase noise requirements. Those high-performance TDCs complicate the synthesizer design and dissipate large part of the power budget, leading to poor jitter-power compromise. This paper introduces a fractional-N PLL based on a 1b TDC, achieving jitter of 560fsrms (from 3kHz to 30MHz) at 4.5mW power consumption, even in the worst-case of fractional spur falling within the PLL bandwidth. The circuit synthesizes frequen cies between 2.92 and 4.05GHz with 70Hz resolution.},

abstract={In modern analog front-ends, there is an increasing demand on high performance analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which require high sampling frequency and low-jitter sampling clock. This makes low-jitter phase-locked loops (PLLs) with jitter on the order of few picoseconds desirable. Unfortunately, due to stringent limit on die area, sometimes a PLL with a ring oscillator is the only choice. To get better phase noise, a wider loop bandwidth is needed to suppress the noise of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). However, due to the discrete-time nature of the operations, the loop bandwidth is limited to one-tenth of the crystal oscillator (XTAL) frequency. One way to solve this problem is to use the injection-locking technique. This method exploits the clean reference clock but has several production problems. One is the frequency offset between injection signal and VCO, and this can be solved by using the injection-locked PLL architecture. However, extra loops are still needed to adjust the injection window due to on-chip variations. In this work, an injection-locked ring PLL (ILRPLL) architecture is proposed to solve this problem. Using the concept of sub-sampling PLL, the injection window is aligned automatically without feedback adjustment. A 432 MHz ILRPLL is realized in ATV/DTV system to justi fy this technique.},

abstract={Digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) have recently emerged as a viable alternative to classical charge-pump analog PLLs. By obviating the need for a large loop filter capacitor and a high-performance charge pump, DPLLs offer area savings and easier scalability to newer processes. The ability to reconfigure the digital loop filter dynamically offers flexibility in setting the loop response and helps to optimize the locking behavior of the DPLL. However, conflicting bandwidth requirements to simultaneously suppress TDC quantization error and oscillator phase noise mandate either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator to minimize jitter. Further, much like in an analog PLL, the ring oscillator is susceptible to supply noise, which especially limits the jitter performance of a DPLL integrated into a large digital system. A low-dropout regulator is commonly used to shield the DCO from supply noise at the expense of additional area, power, and voltage headroom. Alternatively, an open-loop supply-noise cancellation scheme can operate at a lower supply voltage, but its accuracy is highly sensitive to process variations. Analog foreground calibration compensates for process variation but is susceptible to voltage, temperature, and frequency variations. In this paper, we present a deterministic test-signal-based back ground calibration scheme that leverages the highly digital nature of the DPLL to adaptively cancel the supply noise in the DCO. The prototype DPLL achieves nearly perfect supply-noise cancellation over an output frequency range of 0.4 to 3GHz while consuming 2.65mW at 1.5GHz.},

abstract={Sampling clock jitter significantly degrades the circuit performance and dynamic range of an ADC. This paper presents a 570fsrms integrated-jitter 1.21GHz PLL with a hybrid loop. A ring VCO has a much inferior phase noise characteristic as compared to an LC VCO, but its area efficiency is attractive. To suppress the phase noise of a ring VCO, a wide-loop-bandwidth PLL with sufficiently low in-band noise is indispensable. An all-digital PLL (ADPLL) has insufficiently low in-band phase noise because of the quantization error of the time-to-digital converter (TDC) without employing additional techniques such as power-hungry time amplification. On the other hand, a conventional analog PLL has a superior in-band phase noise but needs a large loop-filter capacitor to maintain a wide tuning range due to a high control sensitivity of the ring VCO. The dual-tuning topology is useful for minimizing the size of the loop filter while maintaining low in-band phase noise. However, it also suffers from strong reference spurs, as it is the case in the conventional analog PLL having a wide loop band width. The proposed PLL employs a hybrid loop consisting of a type-ll ADPLL and a type-l analog PLL. The type-ll ADPLL enables the wide tuning range with out a large loop-filter capacitor. The loop-filter capacitor in the analog PLL is also minimized since it does not need to cover a wide tuning range. The analog PLL eliminates the residual quantization error of the TDC in the ADPLL and achieves a sufficiently low in-band phase noise. Overall, the proposed PLL suppresses the phase noise contribution from the ring digital/voltage-controlled oscillator (DVCO).},

Recently, a piezo electric MEMS harvester using AIN was demonstrated to generate enough energy to autonomously power a wireless temperature sensor with a full-bridge rectifier built with off-the-shelf components. Meanwhile, AC-DC converters for piezoelectric harvesters have been designed to enable efficient power extraction, or efficient rectification of low-voltage outputs, and have been tested with commercial meso-scale piezoelectric beams. However, to realize an efficient stand-alone energy generator platform, it is necessary to integrate these efforts into a single low-volume system.

abstract={Most data-intensive operations for multimedia applications such as image processing, vision, and 3D graphics require high external memory bandwidth. In augmented-reality (AR) processors [1], both 3D graphics and vision operations are required, so memory bandwidth becomes even more critical. In [1], however, memory bandwidth is not considered, floating-point processing is not supported, and there is no cache memory for texturing, which is a performance bottleneck of common graphics pipelines. In this work, a heterogeneous multimedia processor is presented to process various mobile multimedia applications in a single chip on Si-interposer for high memory bandwidth. The implemented processor has 4 key features: (1) A transceiver pool (TRx) that reconfigures strength of output drivers according to the channel loss for IC-stacking on Si interposer, (2) A mode-configurable vector processing unit (MCVPU) for frame level parallelism, (3) An energy-efficient unified filtering unit (UFU) with adaptive block selection (ABS) algorithm for memory-access-efficient texturing, and (4) a unified shader (US) with floating-point scalar processing elements (SPE) and partial special function units (PSFU) to enhance graphics processing perform ance and quality. With these techniques, we achieve 1.7χ frame rate and 8χ memory bandwidth improvement in full AR operation.},

abstract={Artificial intelligence (Al) functions are becoming important in smartphones, portable game consoles, and robots for such intelligent applications as object detection, recognition, and human-computer interfaces (HCI). Most of these functions are realized in software with neural networks (NN) and fuzzy systems (FS), but due to power and speed limitations, a hardware solution is needed. For example, software implementations of object-recognition algorithms like SIFT consume ~10W and ~1s delay even on a 2.4GHz PC CPU. Previously, GPGPUs or ASICs were used to realize Al functions. But GPGPUs just emulate NN/FS with many processing elements to speed up the software, while still consuming a large amount of power. On the other hand, low-power ASICs have been mostly dedicated stand-alone processors, not suitable to be ported into many different systems. This paper presents a portable embedded neuro-fuzzy accelerator: the intelligent reconfigurable integrated system (IRIS), which realizes low power consumption and high-speed recognition, prediction and optimization for Al applications.},

abstract={A downside for all direct digital synthesizer (DDS) architectures is that every DDS has a phase accumulator (PA) whose normalized phase value φ must be updated for each (sin 2πφ, cos 2πφ) output-pair produced, and such updating introduces a rather long carry-ripple. PA lengths of 32-b are commonplace and 48-b or longer PA can be found in commercial DDS products. When a DDS with high data-rate is needed, the long PA carry-ripple can present a serious bottle neck-one usually overcome by some form of PA pipelining-but then, only at the cost of a significant increase in "tuning latency" as well as added power consumption and chip-area. Ref. [1] explains how (for a mere 24-b PA) such pipelining introduces a 55-cycle latency, setting the system's frequency-hopping limit at 700/55 = 12.7MHz, for a DDS generating outputs at 700MHz. All such PA pipelining difficulties are completely eliminated by the architecture reported here.},

abstract={Next generation optical and electrical communications such as chip-to-chip serial links or 100GbE require very-high-speed transceivers. At tens of Gb/s, both transmitters and receivers suffer from inadequate bandwidth and high power consumption. One major difficulty arises from the performance degradation of FIR-based FFEs as the FF's CK-Q delay becomes significant to one bit period. Using passive components as delay elements can relax this issue to some extent, but the untunable delay is quite vulnerable to PVT variations. Traditional DFEs also suffer from speed limitation in its feedback loop, and parallelization schemes usually introduce complex circuits and high power consumption. This paper presents a full-rate 40Gb/s transceiver prototype significantly alleviating the above issues.},

abstract={This paper presents a 12.5+12.5Gb/s full-duplex plastic waveguide interconnect solution based on millimeter-wave signal transmission. The plastic waveguide is simply a long solid piece of plastic that provides a very simple, versatile, flexible, and low-cost transmission medium that has the main advantages of optical fiber in isolation and bandwidth, without the need for costly EO and OE. The dielectric waveguide does not need to be connected electrically like the wire or aligned to micron-level accuracy like optical fibers. It can be bent and twisted without significant impact on the signal. Compared to the wireless link discussed earlier, it offers additional signal isolation and confinement. Thus, it can be extended over much longer distances due to the low attenuation in the waveguide (as opposed to free space) and multiple independent lines can be run in parallel to increase the bandwidth. In our proposed plastic waveguide link, the TXs and RXs are fully integrated in CMOS, and the waveguide couplers can be fabricated in a conventional resin package without additional cost. In our existing setting there are a transmitter and a receiver operating at different carrier frequencies on each side of the waveguide, making it possible to realize a full-duplex solution. Because of the smaller fractional bandwidth for the millimeter-wave transmission, no equalization circuit is required.},

abstract={Ever-growing demand for higher communication bandwidth in high performance compute systems is driving the need for energy-efficient multi-Gb/s I/O serial links. Improved power efficiency was demonstrated using adaptive supply regulation. However, power losses in the DC-DC converter needed to generate the optimal supply voltage and the difficulty in operating analog circuits at low voltages limit the power savings. Instead of scaling the supply with the data rate, we seek to operate with two fixed voltages and eliminate the need for a high-efficiency DC-DC converter. To this end, this paper presents a serial link using a highly efficient current recycling-based implicit DC-DC conversion to generate 0.6V from a 1.2V supply. Highly digital clocking circuits capable of operating at 0.6V maximize power savings. A 0.5-to-4Gb/s serial-link transceiver is designed in a 1.2V LP 90nm CMOS process to operate with a short channel and plesiochronous timing. The transceiver dissipates 1.9mW/Gb/s at 3.2Gb/s.},

abstract={Burst-mode clock and data recovery circuits (BMCDR) are widely used in passive optical networks (PON) [1] and as a replacement for conventional CDRs in clock-forwarding links to reduce power [2]. In PON, a single CDR performs the task of clock and data recovery for several burst sequences, each originating from a different source. As a result, the BMCDR is required to lock to an incom ing data stream within tens of Uls (for example 40ns in GPON). Previous works use either injection locking [3, 4] or gated VCO [5, 6] to achieve this fast lock ing. In both cases, the control voltage of the CDR's VCO is generated by a refer ence PLL with a matching VCO to guarantee accurate frequency locking. However, any component mismatch between the two VCO's results in a frequen cy offset between the reference PLL frequency and the CDR's VCO frequency, and hence in a reduction of the CDR's tolerance for consecutive identical digits (CID). For example, [7] reports a frequency offset of over 20MHz (2000ppm) for 10Gb/s operation. We present a BMCDR that is based on phase interpolation (PI), eliminating the possibility of local frequency offset between the reference and recovered clock. We demonstrate 1 to 6Gb/s operation in 65nm CMOS with a locking time of less than 1UI.},

abstract={The limited supply voltage of today's state-of-the-art CMOS technologies makes the design of high-speed transmitters at signaling swings above the typical 1 V supply a challenging task. Higher-voltage TX amplitude is not only required in older I/O standards and legacy applications, but also in emerging electro-optical extensions where high voltage swing combined with high-speed operation is desired. Higher swing also helps meet certain I/O standards in applications where losses introduced by high-density package constraints can be compensat ed to some extent. The source-series terminated (SST) driver is a versatile building block in a multi standard I/O TX thanks to its potential for low-power operation, its low area consumption, high CMOS-style circuit content, and flexible termination capability. Also, the SST driver supports single-ended output and differential operation. This contribution presents a high-swing SST TX based entirely on thin-oxide devices and using a split supply approach for driving the NMOS and the PMOS branches of the output driver, along with a static voltage protection scheme.},

abstract={Recent advances in silicon technology, mm-Wave integrated circuit/antenna/package design, and beam-forming techniques at 60GHz, together with the emergence of suitable wireless standards, have enabled consumer electronics products to support wireless transmission of multi-Gb/s data such as high-definition (HD) audio/video content. Further expansion into portable and mobile platforms will require lower power consumption, smaller form factor, and lower cost. This paper describes a fully integrated, low-cost 60GHz phased-array transceiver pair, implemented in 65nm standard digital CMOS and packaged with an embedded antenna array, capable of robust 10m non-line of sight (NLOS) communication. The array is configurable from 32 elements to 8 or fewer elements, making the transceiver pair suitable for both fixed, high-data-rate and portable, low-power applications. To enhance the robustness of the multi-element design, dynamic phase shifters allow the beam direction to be changed in real time to adapt to changing environments without interruption of the multi-Gb/s data stream. The transceiver pair supports the WirelessHD and draft 802.11ad (WiGig) standards at maximum data rates of 7.14Gb/s and 6.76Gb/s, respectively.},

abstract={This paper describes a unified receiver front-end (RFE) for mobile TV covering the VHF-III (174 to 248MHz), UHF (470 to 862MHz) and L (1.4 to 1.7GHz) bands. The RFE (Fig. 9.7.1) is tailored to avert any external balun, or dedicated narrow-band radios, commonly found in prior arts. The featured advances are threefold: 1) a gain-boosting current-balancing balun-LNA addresses the imbalanced bias current (Ics=4Icg) and load (Rcg=4Rcs) conditions of the noise canceling balun-LNA, improving IIP2 and wideband output balancing while eliminating output buffers; 2) a current-reuse mixer-LPF realizes quadrature/ harmonic-rejection (HR) mixing and 3rd-order current-mode post filtering in one block, enhancing linearity and noise just where both are demanding, while saving power and area; 3) a direct injection-locked 4-/8-phase LO generator (LOG) relaxes the master LO frequency (fLO) by avoiding frequency division. A high fLO has been the speed limit of wideband RFEs with HR, where a 7.2GHz fLO is employed for 0.9GHz RF reception after divide-by-8. Here, the LOG uses 2 chains of 8-phase corrector (8PC) and 1 chain of 4-phase corrector (4PC) to optimize the phase precision in each band. A master LOin (e.g., from VCO) injection locks either one of the chains to synthesize a 4/8-phase LOout at fLO. This LOG scheme particularly suits this application, as the problem of VCO pulling is irrelevant here in the absence of the PA.},

year={2011},

pages={176-178}, 
abstract={One of the recent trends in multimode multiband (MMMB) receivers is to remove the analog filter or variable-gain amplifier (VGA) in the receiver chain and employ a wide-dynamic-range ADC directly after the mixer or include the mixer in the ADC. While such architecture provides ease of programmability once the signals are digitized, it puts a large burden on the ADC and anti-alias filter. Hence, ADCs typically use high-performance analog circuits for wide dynamic range, even though it is difficult to implement these circuits using low-voltage nanoscale CMOS processes. A promising ADC architecture for an MMMB receiver is the VCO-based ADC, since it offers 1st-order noise-shaping from its open-loop digital-intensive nature, thus allowing high sampling rate and high SNR. Furthermore, the VCO-based ADC provides an inherent anti-aliasing 1st-order Sinc filter due to the innate integrating ability of the VCO. Unfortunately, for multiband receivers that do not have an RF pre-filter, a Sinc filter alone does not provide enough out-of-band rejection and hence higher-order anti-aliasing filters are required. In order to solve this problem, we propose a 2nd-order anti-aliasing Sinc filter (Sinc2 filter) that provides double the rejection ratio of a Sinc filter. Furthermore, the proposed technique is highly digital and can be embedded in a VCO, resulting in little overhead.},

With digital power dissipation decreasing with technology much faster than analog power consumption, power efficient ADC designs have to make use of calibration. A major advantage offered by the dual-residue ADC architecture is that the only calibration required is a calibration of the offset voltages of the MDAC amplifiers; a simple algorithm has been implemented that reaches convergence very rapidly and tracks the offsets for temperature drift and aging. Furthermore, the relaxed open-loop gain and bandwidth requirements of the MDACs allowed for a low-power implementation. Low power consumption is essential especially in applications where multiple high-speed ADCs have to be implemented on a single chip, such as 10GBase-T Ethernet.},

abstract={The current-steering DACs are commonly used in generating high-frequency signals. A current-steering DAC comprises current cells of various sizes. Each of them contains a current source and a current switch. The DAC static linearity, specified as differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL), is mainly determined by the mutual matching and the output resistance of the current sources. The DAC also exhibits dynamic distortion. It is manifested as spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) degradation. The SFDR decreases rapidly with increasing input frequency. There are two major sources of dynamic distortion, code-dependent switching transients (CDST) and code-dependent output-loading variation (CDLV). Switching transients are temporal disturbances in DAC out put when the current switches in current cells make transitions. The output load ing of a DAC varies when the output impedances of current cells change due to the transposition of their current switches. This DAC applies a digital random return-to-zero (DRRZ) technique to mitigate the CDST effect. Compact current cells are designed to minimize the CDLV effect. The current mismatches of the current cells are corrected by background calibration.},

abstract={As the NAND flash memory market grows rapidly due to various applications, such as USB devices, MP3 players, SSDs, cellular phones, and cameras, there is a requirement for high-density and low-cost devices. Two different approaches to meet these requirements are increasing data per cell and area scaling. 3b/cell or 4b/cell NAND flash memories were introduced as an effective way to lower cost. However, these devices suffer from program performance degradation since tighter Vth distribution is required. On the other hand, area scaling is a candidate to achieve low cost while maintaining high program performance even though there are several hurdles to overcome, such as FG coupling and charge retention. As the cell size gets smaller, the Vth distribution widens and the erase-write cycling margin is decreased by the floating-gate coupling ratio.},

abstract={This paper presents intelligent solid-state drives (SSDs), which decrease memory errors by 95% and reduce power consumption by 43%. Figure 11.4.1 shows the measured memory cell error in the data retention and program disturb of 4X, 3X and 2Xnm NAND flash memories. As the memory size decreases, both data retention and program disturb errors increase due to the interference, random telegraph noise and reduced electrons. In the scaled NAND, the electric field in the channel increases and the program disturb due to GIDL-induced hot electron injection becomes more significant (Fig. 11.4.1(c)). In conventional SSDs, 20 to 40 b correction per 1 KB codeword error-correcting code (ECC) is used to correct errors. As stronger codes, such as LDPC, are developed, the capability of ECC is close to the Shannon limit of a few percent error correction. Thus, the additional high-reliability scheme is required. As the feature size decreases, the power consumption increases due to the increased bit-line capacitance of NAND. As the space between bitlines decreases, the inter bitline capacitance increases. To overcome reliability and power problems in SSDs, this paper describes two technologies. Asymmetric coding improves memory-cell reliability by 95% without access-time penalty. Stripe pattern elimination algorithm eliminates the worst program data pattern and decreases the power during the program by 43% without circuit area or access time overhead.},

The promising candidates for future NVM such as FeRAM and PCM have demonstrated shorter access time, faster programming and wide read/write bandwidth in the chip and the memory macro. Resistive memory (ReRAM) is also one of alternative NVMs, because of its low operating voltage, high speed and good scalability.

abstract={Harvesting energy from the environment by using a thermoelectric generator (TEG) or photovoltaic cells provides a solution for battery-free sensor networks or electronic healthcare systems. In these systems, the harvested energy is supplied at a very low voltages, requiring a low-startup-voltage power circuit for kick-start from low voltage. A previous sub-100mV-startup-voltage boost converter was implemented by using a mechanically assisted step-up process that needs vibration at startup and the application is rather limited. In this paper, a 95mV startup voltage step-up converter without any mechanical stimulus extends the applicability of energy harvesting. The circuit converts a 100mV input to a 0.9V output with 72% conversion efficiency without any external clocks or mechanical switches. A capacitor pass-on scheme eliminates an additional external output capacitor that functions only at the startup.},

abstract={Home/building energy-management systems (EMSs) driven by information technology are expected to be key to the achievement of an upgraded energy infrastructure, such as Smart Grid. While EMS may offer monitoring, reporting, and control of energy usage, these functions simply track intermittently the energy consumption and operational states of certain appliances and equipments. Further, since their sensing devices are not small, they cannot be attached to every appliance or piece of equipment. Some EMSs gather information, rather, at the power-distribution-board level or the multi-output-tap level. We report here a TX-integrated battery-free real-time current-waveform sensor. It is small enough to be attached to any piece of equipment for continuous power-consumption monitoring. Its key features are : 1) plugless energy harvesting (EH) from AC power lines, 2) real-time sensing and transmitting that use a half-cycle time-to-digital converter (TDC) to detect detailed information on current-wave forms with the precise time-resolution, and 3) asymmetrical power consumption, which helps to achieve high-power RF transmission with a limited EH power supply. Our sensor provides the 1mW power supply from an EH unit, as well as the -5.5dBm RF output power at the 50kS/s sampling with a 1mW EH power supply. We also demonstrate transmission of sensed current-waveform information of several appliances such as a hair dryer, a TV, a notebook PC.},

abstract={Wafer-level testing allows detection of manufacturing errors and removes non functional devices early in the fabrication process. It is commonly performed by placing a probe card directly above a device under test (DUT) and establishing a mechanical contact between them by means of an array of probes. This is an invasive technique that may damage fragile low-k dielectric layers and deform pads or bumps. More importantly, it is very difficult to flip thinned wafers face up for probing if they were earlier positioned face down for back grinding. Additional difficulty in handling of thinned wafers arises if dies have to be flipped again for bumping. One solution to above problems is wireless probing. With a number of proposed techniques for establishing high-speed inductive-coupling data links and measuring DC analog signal wirelessly, the largest remaining obstacle to non-contact wafer-level testing is supplying power to the DUT. This is because wireless power transfer solutions reported earlier do not provide an output power that is sufficient for testing modern high performance devices.This paper presents an inductive power transfer system that is capable of delivering up to 6W of DC power to the on-chip load. The system is partitioned into 8 power transfer channels, each containing two cir cuits: a power transmitter implemented in the probe card, and an on-chip power receiver. This paper focuses on the design of the power receiver, as the receiver performance limits the output power of the whole system.},

abstract={GHz-range applications that operate in a variety of signal situations and/or multiple standards require highly programmable responses that cannot be provided by analog circuits. Conventional digital solutions suffer from aliasing, thus requiring a complicated antialiasing filter and/or extremely high clock speeds with high power dissipation. An alternative is continuous-time (CT) DSP [1], which uses level-crossing sampling [2] but without a clock. It offers activity dependent power dissipation, is alias-free and has lower EMI emissions. This technique has so far been demonstrated in the voice band [3] but cannot be pushed beyond the MHz range because it involves extremely narrow pulse widths that cannot be handled by digital logic. This work bypasses this timing problem, enabling a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in frequency capa bility compared to [3], thus making CT DSP a candidate for wideband GHz low dynamic-range applications, such as those found in pulse radio, spectrum sens ing, and channel equalization. Presented is a 3b 6-tap CT DSP system with wide programmability that is implemented in ST 65nm technology.},

abstract={High-current LED drivers suffer from a significant efficiency loss due to the presence of a current regulation element (CRE) in series with the LED. In a conventional driver, either a series current source or a sense resistor acts as a CRE to regulate the LED current (lLED). In this paper, we seek to improve the efficiency by eliminating the series CRE. To this end, we employ a highly accurate current sensing scheme to directly regulate lLED and achieve more than 13% efficiency improvement. The LED driver is fabricated in a 0.5μm CMOS process and operates at switching frequencies up to 2MHz with an off-chip 2.2μH inductor and a 10μF capacitor. The converter can drive up to 1200mA at an LED forward voltage of about 3.6V. This paper shows the converter start-up, lL, and VSENSE in all the 3 modes of operation. For better illustration, lL is displayed with a 50mA offset on all the plots. Because a different sense-FET is selected in each switching cycle, VSENSE differs from cycle to cycle by the amount of mismatch between the sense-FET and the power-FET. However, VSENSE averaged over 32 switching cycles, obtained from the LED current estimator, yields an accurate measure of the LED current.},

abstract={Many auto-zero or chopper operational amplifiers have been reported with low offset and low-offset drift. The resulting baseband noise can also be a significant error source, and thus reducing the total error down to sub μV levels at DC and low frequencies has been targeted. Chopping is more suitable to lower the base band noise PSD, as it is primarily determined by the broad-band thermal noise floor and not aliased by the high frequency noise. Reducing the thermal noise floor requires higher value of input transconductance. Consequently, more capacitance or higher output transconductance is required to stabilize the over all feedback loop with regular Miller compensation. A 6.5nV/VHz conditionally stable chopper operational amplifier has been reported, using multi-pole feedforward compensation techniques. Unconditionally stable chopper operational amplifiers presented so far exhibit more than 10nVMfz noise PSD. This paper reports a 5.9nV/vTHz unconditionally stable chopper operational amplifier with 1.47mA supply current and 1.26mm2 die area, achieved by phase compensation using current attenuation. In addition, adaptive clock level shift and back gate biasing for the input chopping allows optimization for noise and offset, real izing 0.78μV maximum offset with a worst-case 28.3nV/°C drift.},

abstract={Current-feedback instrumentation amplifiers (CFIAs) have significant advantages over the classic three-opamp topology: better power efficiency higher CMRR and rail-sensing capability. Their main disadvantage, however, is their limited gain accuracy, which is determined by the mismatch of two transconduc tors. Using resistor-degenerated differential pairs, 0.1% gain error and improved linearity have been achieved. However, this incurs either increased noise or increased power. This paper describes a chopper CFIA that employs a contin uous-time (CT) gain error reduction loop (GERL) without incurring a noise penalty. Without trimming, it achieves a gain error of less than 0.06% and a max imum gain drift of 6ppm/°C in a power efficient manner (NEF=11.2).},

abstract={Many sensors demand energy-efficient precision voltage sensing interfaces with low noise performance down to very low frequencies. Examples include micro Kelvin resolution temperature sensors for wafer stepper temperature stabilization and others. In many such applications, analog-to-digital conversion is inevitable, which mandates sampling. So far, sensor interfaces have demonstrated low offset drift using chopping/auto-zeroing while preserving the intrinsic SNR of the transducer by anti-aliasing filtering before sampling. Integration with a boxcar window, or boxcar sampling, is a particularly convenient way to realize anti-aliasing filtering in the sampling process. However, implementations of the technique, due to their use of just a voltage-to-current converter whose output current is integrated over a time window, e.g. in a sigma-delta modulator, remain susceptible to gain drift resulting from either transcon-ductance or time window drift. Meanwhile, related work suggests that embedding the boxcar sampler in a feedback loop effectively removes this limitation. Whereas the loop in is closed electromechanically, the design presented here overcomes the same limitations by using a purely electrical feedback loop to establish a well-defined gain that is insensitive to boxcar sampler parameter drift.},

A 2x size reduction from the previous 45nm design (Pilo et al., 2008) is enabled by an equal 2x reduction in BC area. No corner rounding of BC gates allows tighter overlay of gate electrode and active area. The introduction of HKMG provides a significant reduction in the equivalent oxide thickness, thereby reducing the Vt mismatch. This reduction allows aggressive scaling of device dimensions needed to achieve the small area footprint. A 0.7V VDDMIN operation is enabled by three assist features. Stability is improved by a bitline (BL) regulation scheme. Enhancements to the write path include an increase of 40% of BL boost voltage. Finally, a BC-tracking delay circuit improves both performance and yield across the process space.},

abstract={In multi-ported register files, memory cell size grows quadratically with the total number of ports due to wordline and bitline wiring. Reducing the number of physical access ports in a memory cell can thus lead to significant area and power savings as well as latency improvement. Double-pumped register files operate access ports twice in a single clock period to reduce area by halving the number of physical ports in the memory cell-a technique often confined to low-frequency applications. Replication of a memory cell in separate arrays halves the number of physical read ports in each copy. In this work, double-pumped write ports and replicated read ports are applied to a 4R2W register file in a high performance microprocessor product. This paper describes detailed implementation and measured hardware characteristics of this array and demonstrates a fast error correction scheme. The techniques used balance high efficiency and low latency and thus differ from previous work, in which double pumped ports perform a write followed by a read in a very large register file or where write ports are double-pumped without cell-level read port reduction.},

abstract={In recent years, chip multiprocessor architectures have emerged to scale performance while staying within tight power constraints. This trend motivates per core/block dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with fast voltage transition. Given the high cost and bulk of off-chip DC/DC converters to implement multiple on-chip power domains, there has been a surge of interest in on-chip converters. This paper presents the design and experimental results of a fully integrated 3-level DC/DC converter that merges characteristics of both inductor-based buck and switched-capacitor (SC) converters. While off-chip buck converters show high conversion efficiency, their on-chip counterparts suffer from loss due to low quality inductors. With the help of flying capacitors, the 3-level converter requires smaller inductors than the buck converter, reducing loss and on-die area overhead. Compared to SC converters that need more com plex structures to regulate higher than half the input voltage, 3-level converters can efficiently regulate the output voltage across a wide range of levels and load currents. Measured results from a 130nm CMOS test-chip prototype demon strate nanosecond-scale voltage transition times and peak conversion efficiency of 77%.},

The CNB provides an interface to a sin gle 64b DDR3 memory channel, which can operate at up to DDR3-1066. The Fusion architecture implements an efficient form of unified memory architecture (UMA) where a portion of system memory is reserved as graphics frame buffer memory. The graphics memory controller (GMC) arbitrates between graphics, video and display memory accesses and presents a well-ordered stream of sys tem memory requests through the CNB over dedicated 256b wide read and write busses. These GMC requests bypass all of the CNB coherency mechanisms allowing for fast direct access to memory and exposing most of the available memory bandwidth (8.53GB/S). Compared to two chip solutions, use of the on die integrated GPU significantly reduces memory latency, improves request ordering, and reduces power The APU supports display formats including VGA, LVDS, Display Port, DVI or HDMI™.

abstract={Cryptographic circuits can be subjected to several kinds of side-channel and fault attacks in order to extract the secret key. Side-channel attacks can be carried by measuring either the power consumed or the EM waves emitted by the cryptographic module and trying to find a correlation between the given side-channel and the data manipulated. Concerning fault attacks, in the case of differential fault attacks (DFA), a cryptographic calculation is corrupted in such a way as to retrieve information about the secret key. Faults can be induced by different means such as lasers, voltage glitches, electromagnetic perturbations or clock skews. Several counter-measures, like in, have been separately proposed to tackle either kind of attack. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an AES chip where duplicated and complemented data paths provide resistance against both side-channel and fault attacks.},

abstract={Search of a compact quadrature generator at around 60GHz with low phase noise at moderate power is the topic of this work. Discarding a double-frequency VCO followed by dividers-by-two given the high frequency range of operation, the most suitable topology borrowed by RF solutions is represented by cross-coupled LC voltage-controlled oscillators. However, the oscillation frequency dependence on the biasing current makes it susceptible to phase noise, close-in in particular. At mm-Waves, this is exacerbated by core devices of small dimensions to such an extent that 1/f noise remains dominant up to more than ~10MHz, making it unsuitable for stringent applications. On the contrary a ring of two VCOs magnetically coupled to each other has an oscillation frequency dependence on inter-stage passive components only, low 1/f noise together with good quadrature accuracy. The quadrature oscillator has been realized in a 65nm CMOS technology and prototypes show the following performances: 56-to-60.3GHz tunable oscillation frequency, phase noise better than -95dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset in the tuning range, 1.5° maximum phase error while consuming 22mA from a 1V supply.},

abstract={With a cut-off frequency in excess of 250GHz, nanometer-scale CMOS technology is rapidly expanding from Radio Frequency to mm-Waves applications. Frequency dividers are key building blocks for LO generation in wireless transceivers and clock synchronization in front-ends for wire-line and optical communications. Dividers based on traditional static CML latches work over a wide band but power dissipation at mm-Waves is extremely large. To save power, recently reported mm-Wave PLLs propose tunable narrowband dividers, based on injection-locking techniques, together with digital calibration algorithms. On the other hand, for division factors higher than 2, the frequency locking range of injection-locked oscillators is very limited, mandating fine and frequent calibrations. This paper introduces clocked differential amplifiers, working as dynamic CML latches, to realize high speed and low power mm-Wave dividers. The solution is very compact, which is particularly desirable at mm-Waves to ease chip layout and shorten IC interconnections, minimizing signal losses. A frequency divider-by-4 has been realized in a 65nm bulk CMOS technology and prototypes prove an operating frequency programmable from 20 to 70GHz. The frequency range in each sub-band spans from 10% to 17%, corresponding to a 2.5x to 4x improvement compared to injection-locked dividers-by-4. Maximum power dissipation is 6.5mW and occupied area is only 15μm × 30μm.},

abstract={Some applications of wireless sensor networks (WSN) require long-term deployments and vanishingly-small unit volumes to make them cost effective and unobtrusive. Energy and area-efficient circuits, as well as eliminating off chip components, are critical to meeting these objectives. A conventional WSN node can be fully integrated in CMOS except for the battery, crystal reference, and antenna. Typically, a PLL and a crystal reference are used for RF synchronization and to position the wireless signal in a desired band for FCC compliance. Crystals, however, require custom packaging that currently prohibits scaling to mm3 sizes. Moreover, an off-chip antenna increases the size of the node and raises the cost. In this paper, a fully integrated 60GHz frequency-locked loop (FLL) in 0.13μm CMOS is presented using an on-chip patch antenna as both the radiator and reference for frequency generation. The proposed technique efficiently integrates the antenna, eliminates the need for a crystal reference, is FCC compliant, and ensures the node transmits at the antenna's peak efficiency. The substrate beneath the antenna is shielded by an intermediate metal layer ground plane, freeing up space for active circuits and routing beneath the patch. By inte grating circuits in CMOS underneath the patch, and stacking the die on e.g. a thin-film battery, a fully integrated WSN node in mm3 scale is feasible.},

Tunable signal sources are one of the main blocks in any such systems. Fundamental frequency voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are widely employed for signal generation. However, CMOS VCOs suffer from low tuning range and low output power due to poor quality fac tor of varactors at high mm-Wave frequencies [2]. To alleviate these drawbacks CMOS frequency multipliers have been proposed for frequencies below 150GHz [2,3]. At higherfrequencies, multipliers are implemented using compound semi conductors [4,5].

abstract={A frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar using triangular modulation is one of the promising candidates for realizing a CMOS radar IC. Range and velocity resolutions of the FMCW radar are determined by the band width and period of triangular modulation (Pourvoyeur et al., 2008). A short-range measurement requires wide (several GHz) bandwidth, while a long-range measurement with high-velocity resolution requires moderate (hundreds of MHz) bandwidth and long (several ms) period. Furthermore, since frequency error in the FMCW signal deteriorates range and velocity accuracy, a highly linear frequency chirp signal is required. However FMCW radars reported so far exhibit a period up to 1.5ms because a long period degrades the chirp linearity in a conventional analog PLL. In this work, an analog/digital mixed-mode 82GHz FMCW synthesizer with 1.5GHz bandwidth, a period from 1ms to 10ms and less than 180kHzrms frequency error is described. The achieved performance corresponds to range and velocity resolutions of 10cm and 1.4km/h, respectively.},

abstract={Terahertz and mm-Wave-based imagers have recently gained interest for imaging in security screening and bio-imaging applications. For these applications to become practical, the core pixel circuits employed in an imaging array must meet challenging constraints that originate from the system level design and the needs of constructing large array structures on-chip. The most critical of these constraints is that the pixel must consume very low power, as an array will inflate the total power by n2, where n2 is the total number of pixels in a square (n x n) array. Pixel circuit area is the 2nd major constraint, as the single pixel area will be also inflated by n2. This area constraint is critical because the cost-effective pixel array should ideally fit on a wafer to facilitate monolithic fabrication and avoid the need for complicated mechanical assembly of multiple array sections. A third system-level constraint similar to that experienced in CMOS image sensor arrays is the challenge of routing large numbers of analog signals between each pixel in the array and the sampling ADC.},

abstract={An important drawback of current biopotential monitoring systems is their dependence on gel electrodes, which can dry out, cause skin irritation, and necessitate skilled personnel. These associated drawbacks increase the running costs and significantly hamper their use in consumer healthcare and lifestyle applications. Unfortunately, the use of gel-free, or dry, electrodes increases the electrode-tissue contact impedance, thus exacerbating the effects of interference and cable motion artifacts. A solution is the use of active electrodes, i.e. electrodes in which an amplifier with high input impedance, low noise and good electrode offset rejection is co-integrated. Previous active electrodes employed voltage buffers to facilitate the inter-channel gain matching necessary to achieve high CMRR. However, low-noise buffers consume significant power and due to their lack of gain still require a low-noise and thus power-hungry back-end to keep the total integrated noise at acceptable levels. To reduce the total power dissipation, this paper proposes a biopotential monitoring system based on active electrodes with gain.},

We present a neural interface in 65nm CMOS and operating at a 0.5V supply that obtains performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art systems in a silicon area over 3x smaller. These results are achieved by using a scalable architecture that avoids on-chip passives and takes advantage of high-density logic. The use of 65nm CMOS eases integration with low-power digital systems, while the low supply voltage makes the design more compatible with wireless powering schemes.},

abstract={Optical transcutaneous data links have rarely been researched, and mostly out of-body communication with high data rates has been investigated: up to 40Mb/s has been achieved with high power consumption and an obvious drawback was the implantation of a photoemitter as part of the system. Optical communication was used to control an epiretinal stimulator. The photoemitter sits in front of the lens, and a receiving discrete photodiode (PD) is placed in the line of sight. The PD is connected to a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), which is integrated on the stimulator ASIC.},

abstract={This paper introduces a readout circuit designed to interface with the fluorescence sensor presented in O'Sullivan et al., 2010., a monolithically integrated GaAs detector and vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). The detector signals to be measured are low currents in the range of 5pAto15nA, with bandwidths up to 100 Hz. In order to capture binding dynamics of the fluorescent probe, as well as a wide range of possible tumor sizes and depths, the desired current resolution is 5pA. In applications with such low bandwidths and high sensitivity, a capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) can be used to provide high SNR through noise averaging (Ou and Chin, 203). The input current is integrated onto a capacitor Cint for a period of time Tint. The output of the CTIA is usually sampled and held at the end of Tint, before being digitized as a DC signal. The readout noise power introduced at the sampling instant, σ2read, limits the maximum achievable SNR of this architecture. If, instead, M samples are taken along the integration ramp and line-fitting is performed, the white noise component of σ2read is reduced by M/12, as shown in Fowler and Gatley, 1991.},

abstract={Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness, affecting 67 million people worldwide. The disease damages the optic nerve due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and can cause complete vision loss if untreated. IOP is commonly assessed using a single tonometric measurement, which provides a limited view since IOP fluctuates with circadian rhythms and physical activity. Continuous measurement can be achieved with an implanted monitor to improve treatment regiments, assess patient compliance to medication schedules, and prevent unnecessary vision loss. The most suitable implantation location is the anterior chamber of the eye, which is surgically accessible and out of the field of vision. The desired IOP monitor (IOPM) volume is limited to 1.5mm3 (0.5x1.5x2mm3) by the size of a self-healing incision, curvature of the cornea, and dilation of the pupil.},

The sensor is partitioned into 4 identical quadrants that are served by a balanced clock tree so as to minimize skews and to ensure the fastest possible readout process. The pixels in the rows are read out in rolling shutter mode in two directions (top and bottom) simultaneously. The 10b content of each pixel is thus transferred to the exterior of the chip via 320 independent serializers, 2 for each column, working in parallel at a maxi mum rate of 160Mb/s, thus enabling in principle the readout of a complete frame in 4μs. In our implementation the frame rate is actually lower, due to current lim itations in the readout firmware. The region-of-interest (Rol) is programmable, via vertical and horizontal registers that select which rows and columns are read out.},

Now that N-type semiconductors have become much more easily processed, developers are seeking a complete CMOS and lifetime robust technology. Many previous works have reported on a complete solution based on CMOS technology. Large-area-compatible organic processes have also been demonstrated.

pages={338-340}, 
abstract={Flip-flops (FF) typically consume more than 50% of random-logic power in an SoC chip, due to their redundant transition of internal nodes, when the input and the output are in the same state. Several low-power techniques have been proposed, but all of them incur transistor-count penalties, leading to an increase in size, which is too costly since flip-flops typically account for 50% of random-logic area. In this work, we design and test a D-flip-flop, known as adaptive-coupling flip-flop (ACFF), which has a reduced transistor count compared to other low-power flip-flops, and 2 fewer transistors than the mainstream transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF). ACFF features a single-phase clocking structure, with no local clock buffer and no precharging stage, enabling it to be more energy efficient than TGFF, where up to 77% energy saving is achieved at 0% data activity. ACFF also has an adaptive-coupling configuration, which weakens state retention coupling during a transition, allowing it to be tolerant to process variations. Test chips are fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology for 1.1V application, and 500k ACFFs are tested over all chips in 5 skew wafers. All tested ACFFs are fully functional down to 0.75V supply voltage, with spreads of timing parameters comparable to TGFF. We also demonstrate a P&R test by employing ACFF to a wireless LAN chip, and the results indicate chip power is reduced by as much as 24%.},

abstract={In this paper, the authors demonstrate a standard cell-based circuit technique fully operational at supply voltages between 84 mV and 62 mV in standard 0.13 μm bulk CMOS depending on the area overhead invested. Supply voltage reduction is limited by the degradation of the on/off current-ratio of CMOS transistors with decreasing VDD, causing the leakage currents through the off transistors to be on the same order of magnitude as the drive currents. The result is an output level degradation of logic gates due to a voltage divider-like behavior, an effect emphasized by process variability. In this work, the output level degradation is mitigated by the use of Schmitt trigger structures, which exhibit an effective leakage quenching in the off-path of a gate and have been proposed for low-voltage RAM.},

abstract={A robust transceiver designed for NRZ signaling beyond 10Gb/s over long-range physical media (including electrical backplanes, copper cables and optical modules) must contend with significant challenges from insertion loss, crosstalk, and reflection. For inter-symbol interference (ISI) cancellation, half-rate decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with unrolled first tap is widely used to avoid noise amplification and to relax timing for data sampling/feedback. However, tap-unrolling increases slicer count and entails half-rate multiplexers eating into timing margin. To remove reflection-induced ISI due to impedance discontinuities in the media, the DFE must cover tap positions higher than 30UI which is beyond tap range of the DFEs reported in previous work.},

abstract={In networking systems today data rates are increasing beyond 15Gb/s and yet the installed backplanes are made of low cost materials with losses in excess of 30dB at 7.5GHz. Standards, such as IEEE802.3ap-10GBASE-KR and OIF CEI25G, are specifying SerDes requirements for channels with 25dB loss at Nyquist and this has driven the development of SerDes with 4 or 5 tap DFEs. Until now, solutions for 34dB or more channel loss have been limited to 10.3Gb/s or below, whereas this paper describes an adaptive 14-tap DFE that achieves a 1017 BER across a 34dB loss channel at 16Gb/s for a power of 235mW/lane. A baud-rate CDR technique is specifically developed that gives excellent locking characteristics and alignment for use with a speculative DFE together with an enhanced swing TX voltage mode driver.},

abstract={The bandwidth limitation of existing backplanes has become an obstacle to meeting the increasing demand for high-data-rate wireline transmission. In order to compensate for this limitation, TX pre-emphasis, RX continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and DFE are necessary. This work presents a 4-lane transceiver implemented in 40nm CMOS technology that operates over a wide range of data rates from 1 to 12Gb/s (48Gb/s aggregated) using NRZ coding. The supply voltages are 0.9V and 1.8V. An algorithm is developed to adapt the CTLE and DFE to cancel the channel ISI. No inductors are used in the design and ring oscillators are used for both the TX and RX clock generation. This provides a wide frequency-tuning range, small layout area, and high design portability. With extensive use of digital programmability this transceiver is capable of meet ing specifications of different standards, such as PCIe, SATA, and 1 to 10Gb/s Ethernet.},

abstract={The use of adaptive equalizers at the front end of receivers is becoming a necessity as the data rates increase without channel improvements. Adaptive equalizers can be implemented using data-aided or non-data-aided schemes, with the latter requiring less area and power. Previous non-data-aided adaptive schemes implement an asynchronous analog algorithm where the power spectrum of the received signal is checked for balance around a threshold frequency. Similarly, proposes a digital adaptive algorithm which is based on the detection of specific 5-bit patterns. In all three works, however, adaptation is provided only for equalizers with a single coefficient, which are suitable for well-behaved channels. In contrast, this paper presents a digital adaptive engine for an equalizer with two coefficients: one adjusting the equalizer gain at the Nyquist frequency (fN) and one at fN/2. Furthermore, the proposed engine is asynchronous; it can function when driven by a blind clock at the receiver. This is useful as it allows the adaptation process to start even when the CDR has not yet achieved lock. This also avoids a deadlock situation where the CDR and equalizer require simultaneous access to the equalized data and the recovered clock. Our measured results of the proposed adaptive equalizer in 65nm CMOS confirm that the adaptation converges to within 2.6% of the optimal vertical eye opening in less than 400 μs for two different channels at a data rate of 6 Gb/s with a 25,000 ppm frequency offset.},

pages={356-358}, 
abstract={To ensure the signal integrity over a lossy channel, an analog equalizer and/or a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are widely adopted in high-speed data transmission. An adaptive analog equalizer or adaptive DFE is also attractive to compensate the frequency-dependent loss due to the different channel lengths and environment variations. Conventionally, a multiple-tap DFE is adopted to compensate the inter-symbol interference (ISI), which is induced by postcursors due to the non-ideal channel impulse responses. To avoid the power and area penalty due to many postcursors, a DFE with infinite impulse response (MR) filter feedback has been presented. In [B. Kim et al., 2009], no adaptation scheme ensures that such MR filter cancels the postcursors precisely, i.e., its RC time constant and amplitude need to be manually adjusted. In this work, a 6Gb/s receiver using a DFE with an adaptive continuous-time MR filter and a clock/data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented. In a high loss environment, a conventional digital qaudricor relator frequency detector (QFD) may fail due to the significant data dependent jitter. To integrate an adaptive DFE with a CDR circuit, a proposed frequency sweeping frequency detector (FD) and a lock detector (LD) are presented in this work.},

abstract={Over the last decade, significant progress has been made towards increasing integration and reducing bill of material (BOM) for GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular systems. In modern cellular phones, transmit SAW filters have been largely eliminated with innovative TX architecture and circuits [1] while receive SAW filters are still present. This remains as one of the few bottlenecks in achieving a true low-cost single-chip solution which offers a genuine advantage for high-volume applications. The main challenges of eliminating SAW-based bandpass filters from multiband 2G/2.5G receivers lie in noise-figure (NF) degradation and gain desensitization induced by OdBm blockers at merely 20MHz away from the 99dBm in-band signal at GSM850/900 band. Furthermore, these unfiltered inter ferers cause a strong reciprocal mixing effect and result in additional SNR degra dation. Therefore, a SAW-less RX is required to have an extremely high dynam ic range while maintaining best-in-class NF, LO wideband phase noise (PN) and spur performance. In this paper, a receiver embedded in a single-chip quad-band GSM SoC imple mented in 65nm CMOS technology is presented.},

This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 EDGE bands and 9 WCDMA bands (l-VI and Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 EDGE bands and up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high bands (HB) and 2 low bands (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all EDGE bands and 4 for the WCDMA bands.},

abstract={The spectrum allocated for the operation of cellular services is country dependent and fragmented in several frequency bands. Mobile phones, to be usable globally, are therefore required to support many bands. The lack of suitable tuneable pre-selection filters and duplexers mandates the use of a large number of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) in the receiver section of the transceiver. Minimization of the area occupied by the LNAs is therefore important. Virtually every transceiver for mobile phone applications published to date makes use of LNAs employing on-chip or on-passivation spiral inductors. Spiral inductors are large and do not scale with technology, leading to an increasing relative cost of the receiver front-end with newer technology nodes. Post-passivation and SiP technologies also add noticeably to the costs. In this paper we present the first receiver employing no on-chip or above-passivation spiral inductors on the receive signal path and with a linearity and noise performance suitable for WCDMA/EDGE applications. The eight channel direct-conversion receiver is part of a multimode transceiver requiring neither RX nor TX inter stage SAW filters for FDD 3G operation.},

abstract={A direct quadrature voltage modulator has been disclosed and current mode upconversion mixer with linearity boosting technique as preferred concepts for WCDMA transmitters (TX), enabling a solution for TX noise reduction at some duplex distances. Two problems remain unsolved: how to remove the TX SAW at the other duplexer distances, and how to support still highly desirable 2G and 2.5G modes, required for full coverage, without increasing power consumption and system complexity. A multimode solution was addressed but 2G and 2.5G far-off noise performance was not disclosed and in 3G high band an external local oscillator signal was still used. Further multimode work has been presented, where required far off noise performance has been achieved but at the expense of the large chip area due to dedicated 2G/3G signal paths and still a high power consumption. The single-chain TX (all modes reuse the same signal path) has been focus in the work, where other advantages of a digital concept have been demonstrated, but the TX SAW filter in 3G mode cannot be omitted due to higher-than-allowed far-off noise and remaining repetition spectrum. A further single-chain TX solution based on the analog polar modulator has been disclosed, demonstrating reuse of the signal path for 2G/3G systems in an analog polar transmitter concept, but TX noise in the RX band has not been disclosed. Recently, a fully digital polar modulator for 2G and 2.5G modes has been published with a low chip area and low power consumption, but still with unsolved far-off noise for the co-existence of cellular application with navigation and connectivity.},

abstract={So far all mainstream transmitters for WCDMA are of the direct upconversion type. This architecture is versatile but requires calibration of the imbalance in its quadrature branches and DC offset at its inputs, and it is vulnerable to mixer noise. We believe it consumes more power and chip area than is warranted, and propose the polar transmitter as an alternative. Although it has been widely discussed as the ideal transmitter for EDGE, the polar architecture has yet to make significant inroads there, let alone into wideband CDMA. We will describe new circuits that enable a compact, largely self-calibrated polar transmitter, whose lower power and chip area put it ahead of state-of-the-art direct upconversion transmitters.},

In this paper, a PMU integrated as part of a GSM/EDGE chip in a 65nm deep-Nwell CMOS process, comprising a battery charger, a regulated inverting charge pump, multiple regulators, and a White LED (WLED) driver is presented. The battery charger supports various charging profiles up to VCHG=12V and can tolerate up to 20V. A regulated charge pump (CP) operating directly from the battery (VBAT) provides negative supply for earphone class-AB audio power amplifiers (APA) for ground referred headset connectors. A buck converter and several linear regulators supply the various sub-systems on the chip as well as external modules (SIM Card/Camera/Interfaces etc.).

abstract={Lossless load current sensing ability is one of the most desirable features of contemporary current-or voltage-mode-controlled DC-DC converters. Current sensing can be used for short circuit detection, multi-stage converter load balancing, thermal control, and load-independent control of DC-DC converters (Woo et al., 2008). Recently, current sensing techniques using the existing inductor series DC resistance (DCR) are gaining attention due to their reduced complexity and minimized loss. These techniques increase the need for inductor build-in self test (BIST) ability to measure DCR. Inductor BIST is also critical for high-reliability applications such as automotive and aerospace systems where component variation and drift need to be closely monitored. An analog inductor characterization and current sensing technique utilizing Gm-C filtering is proposed in [2], where the gain errors and sensing offset are cancelled in analog domain. The DC-DC buck converter presented here uses an offset-independent inductor characterization enabling a digital continuous lossless load-current-sensing scheme. The proposed inductor BIST and current-sensing techniques can be extended to current-mode-controlled converters and multi-stage parallel converters as well.},

abstract={In switching power converters, the turn on/off process of switches is crucial for the reliability and efficiency of the converter. In general, optimum switching is challenging, and it is particularly difficult for hard switching. The MOSFET synchronous buck converter having wide applications due to high switching speed and low loss, however, operates in hard switching and needs a good timing control for its switching. On/off commutation dead-times should be adjusted care fully in accordance with load current change. Previous work on the dead-time control includes predictive gate drive technique, load current sensing, sensor-less optimization technique, and delay-locked loops. These techniques have problems of sensing noisy switching node or load current, and requiring high quantizing resolution. In this paper, a near optimum dead-time control method is proposed that resolves such problem.},

pages={394-396}, 
abstract={Power management in portable devices demands small size, low cost as well as long battery lifetime, which in turn drive the development of single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters. Due to the battery voltage variation during usage and the wide-range dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) applied for power reduction, high-efficiency buck-boost conversion is required to extend the battery lifetime. The buck-boost converter selects the operation mode by comparing the output with the supply voltage, which is not suitable for multioutput converters. The reported single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck-boost converter uses a state machine with sophisticated current sense for mode selection and requires a freewheeling state that dissipates energy. The converter uses one additional auxiliary inductor for step-up/down mode adjustment. This paper proposes an extended-PWM (EPWM) control which automatically selects buck or boost mode and facilitates smooth mode transition. It is suitable for flexible outputs and maintains a high efficiency in buck and in boost converters.},

year={2011}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={396-398}, 
abstract={Buck regulators are widely employed in portable devices due to their high power-conversion efficiency. However, due to their spurious output noise, they are not directly used to power sensitive analog/RF modules, and subsequent linear low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are needed to generate secondary low-noise supply rails for these modules. This results in lower efficiency, and increased size and cost. Moreover, as switching frequencies increase to reduce passive components, LDOs become less effective in filtering the switching noise due to their poor power-supply rejection (PSR) beyond 1 MHz. Several techniques for reducing the spurious noise of buck regulators by manipulating their switching behavior have been studied. This includes using ΔΣ or Δ modulators in the control loop, which although reduce the spurs, result in large increases in the noise floor that mandates subsequent LDOs. Other techniques redistribute the power of each spur into multiple smaller ones using random frequency hopping, or periodic monotonic frequency stepping. However, the resulting spectrum continues to be spurious and the reduction reported in the largest spur is limited to 10 to 12 dB. This limited reduction, coupled with the fact that many extra spurs are generated, leaves the load circuitry vulnerable to performance degradation. This paper proposes a pulse-width modulation (PWM) control scheme for buck converters based on combining random frequency hopping with phase chopping. The technique results in full elimination of spurs, elimination of hopping transients, very low noise floor, and minimalist implementation with little overhead on area and power.},

abstract={In 2002, we reported a CCD image sensor with 260x312 pixels capable of capturing 103 consecutive images at 1,000,000 frames per second (1Mfps). We named the sensor "ISIS-V2", for In-situ Storage Image Sensor Version 2.103 memory elements are attached to every pixel; generated image signals were instantly and continuously stored in the in-situ storage without being read out of the sensor. The ultimate high-speed recording was enabled by this parallel recording at all pixels. In 2006, the color version, ISIS-V4, was reported. In 2009, we developed ISIS-V12, a backside-illuminated image sensor mounting the ISIS structure and the CCM, charge-carrier multiplication, on the front side. The CCM is a CCD-specific efficient signal-amplification device. CCM, combined with the BSI structure and cooling, achieved very high sensitivity. The ISIS-V12 was a test sensor intended to prove the technical feasibility of the structure. The maximum frame rate was 250kfps for a charge-handling capacity of Qmax=10,000e and 1Mfps for a reduced Qmax. The pixel count was 489x400 pixels. For backside-illuminated (BSI) image sensors, metal wires can be placed on the front surface to increase the frame rate without reducing fill factor or violating uniformity of the pixel configuration. It has been proved by simulations that 100Mfps is achievable by introducing innovative technologies including a special wiring method. We now report on ISIS-V16, developed by incorporating technologies to increase the frame rate with those to achieve very high sensitivity, which was confirmed by evaluation of ISIS-V12.},

As rapid progress is made on com pact, high-frequency NIR LEDs, much research is being devoted to improve ments in the size, sensitivity and resolution of TOF image sensors.

abstract={Conventional cameras capture 2D photographs at a single plane of focus. Acquisition of a 3D photograph with multiple planes of focus typically requires scanning the focus of a single camera, or using arrays of cameras or lenses. This paper demonstrates a 150kpixel image sensor, which captures 3D scenes. The chip is manufactured in commodity 0.18μm CMOS and requires only a single convex lens at a fixed focal length in ambient light. As traditional image sensors only capture the intensity of the light at each location, they lose significant information about out-of-focus objects. Recovering the angular distribution of incident light permits recovery of the blurred, out-of-focus objects. This paper presents a CMOS imager that locally captures both the intensity and incident angle of the light striking it.},

abstract={This paper presents a VGA 1/13-inch system-on-chip (SoC), primarily targeted for the consumer camera mobile phone market. In this market low cost, ease of product integration, low module height, and low light image quality are important features. The SoC simplifies integration of the sensor into the final product by providing camera functions such as: automatic exposure control, automatic white balance, flicker detection and avoidance, etc. This reduces cost and saves power since no companion chip is required, and the internal image-processing data rate of the SoC is higher than the output data rate [1], which keeps the inter chip communication data rate as low as possible. The small optical format enables a low camera module height. However, the choice of the small optical format also restricts the pixel pitch to 1.75μm, which influences both image quality and die size. The low light image quality, in this sensor, is improved by incorporating a 1.75μm pixel architecture, and the size of the sensor core is greatly reduced by removing the dark pixel reference rows and columns, using a single side dual bank of double-pitch sampling capacitors, a class-AB pro grammable-gain amplifier (PGA), followed by an inter-stage shared pipeline ADC.},

abstract={Recently, the demands to achieve both high-speed and high-quality imaging including high A/D resolution have increased. The new target specification is 60fps Ultra-High-Definition with 12b resolution. This imaging requires 24Gb/s, while reported CMOS image sensors have reached up to 6.5Gb/s. This paper presents a 34.8Gb/s CMOS image sensor with high image quality, which realizes 17.7M pixels at 120fps with 12b resolution and a dynamic range of over 75dB (one of the highest image qualities, compared with data from). Generally there exists a trade-off between high-speed imaging and high image quality. This is because high-speed imaging brings high power with high thermal noise, which also degrades the signal quality, and because fast data transfer may require more output pins, bringing more interference.},

abstract={As CMOS technology continues to scale for SoC applications, significant challenges to implement a monolithic linear high-power amplifier have emerged. This results from the low breakdown voltage of transistors, high on-chip passive loss on a conductive substrate, stringent bump-pattern constraints and thermal dissipation requirements of flip-chip packages. Most fully-integrated linear CMOS PAs reported to date were either fabricated on a relatively mature process (65nm or above) in a wire-bonded die with relatively high supply voltage (3.3V), or exhibited low power efficiency when backed-off. In many cases, digital pre-distortion was implemented to improve linearity and efficiency. We present a 1.8V single-chip CMOS PA with 21dBm average output power and 16% PAE while meeting -25dB EVM for 64-QAM OFDM signal without digital pre-distortion linearization in 32nm SoC CMOS on a flip-chip package. This per formance is enabled by: 1) On-chip shielded concentric transformers with power-splitting/combining structures to fit the design within the bump pattern constraint and thermal dissipation requirement of an SoC flip-chip package and to enhance power handling capability; 2) Minimum phase distortion by opti mized inter-stage power matching allowed by the high fmax of the minimum channel-length device.},

abstract={Although Si CMOS PAs for mobile applications have demonstrated specification-compliant performance over the last several years, Si CMOS has not been widely employed in cellular PA applications due to certain inferior properties of its power capability, PAE, and breakdown to its counterparts such as GaAs and SiGe BJTs. However, research conducted in the past decade has enabled commercially available cellular switching CMOS PAs for constant envelope modulation such as GSM applications. This successful implementation of a GSM PA called forth a demand for a combination of linear EDGE operation with GSM operation in order to increase data rate up to 384kb/s while using legacy infrastructures. The challenges of implementation of a dual-mode CMOS PA arise from required linearity for high peak-to-average-power ratio, which forces the PA to operate at power back-off from the P1dB and results in inevitable low efficiency. Although a CMOS EDGE/GSM PA was reported in the past, the application was intended for Class-E3 operation. The presented PA is an EDGE/GSM dual-mode, quad-band CMOS cellular application PA satisfying the requirement for power Class-E2 operation.},

pages={432-433}, 
abstract={One of the remaining challenges in implementing CMOS 60GHz radios is to cover longer communication distance as the high path loss at mm-Wave frequencies demands higher EIRP, which in turn requires considerable design effort on the transmitter. In addition, to comply with the OFDM transmitting mode of the IEEE 802.15.3c standards, the power amplifier (PA) must be capable to handle a peak power level 6~9dB higher than the average without sacrificing reliability. With the low supply voltage limitation of deeply scaled CMOS technologies, efficient power-combining techniques are essential. Spatial power combining is an attractive solution to meet the EIRP goal, but at the cost of spending extra power on the complex signal distribution and in order to compensate for the phase-shifter loss. Spatial power-combining solutions also occupy larger area due to the requirement of multiple antennas, minimum antenna spacing, and the transmission line feed network. On the other hand, CMOS PAs with on chip power-combining structures have achieved 18dBm of output power. However, all the combiners comprise multiple stages to achieve both impedance transformation and power combining which not only increase the insertion loss and directly degrade the efficiency, but also consume a significant amount of silicon area, rendering them far less appealing for system integration. This paper presents a fully integrated 18.6dBm CMOS PA based on an efficient and compact on-chip power combiner.},

year={2011}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={436-438}, 
abstract={ADC-based receivers allow for extensive equalization in the digital domain and therefore can easily compensate for channel loss at higher data rates. Digital equalization can be implemented as an FFE or DFE. An adaptive FFE is straight forward to implement, as it relies on magnitudes only (not phases) of the blind samples, however, it enhances the quantization noise of the ADC. A DFE has better noise immunity, but challenges remain in designing an adap tive DFE for receivers with blind clocks. A typical adaptive engine for a DFE com pares the equalized center samples against a desired level to calculate error in each sample. The power of this error is then minimized to guide equalization. In a blind receiver, however, the center samples are not known; the blind samples may deviate from the eye's center and move closer to the zero crossings. As a result, one cannot use a single desired level independent of the blind sampling phase; the desired level must change according to the sampling phase. In this paper, we use a desired waveform, instead of a desired level, to perform the adaptation. Our measurement results confirm that this approach adapts the coefficients within 80μs and opens an otherwise closed eye for a channel atten uation of 13.3dB at 2.5GHz.},

abstract={Clock and data recovery (CDR) circuits with wide frequency acquisition range offer flexibility in optical communication networks, help reduce link power through activity-based rate adaptation, and minimize cost with a single-chip multi-standard solution. Extracting the bit rate from the incoming random data stream is the main challenge in implementing reference-less CDRs. A conventional rotational frequency detector has a limited acquisition range of about ±50% of the VCO frequency, consumes large power, and is susceptible to harmonic locking. Extending its range requires additional high-speed circuitry and a complex state machine. The DLL-based architecture requires passing high-speed data through a long string of power-hungry buffers, imposes stringent matching requirements, and works only with ring oscillators. Other approaches require detailed statistical or timing analysis. Further, all the above techniques are only suitable for full-rate CDRs. In this paper, we present a reference-less half-rate CDR that uses a sub-harmonic extraction method to achieve unlimited frequency acquisition range. This technique is capable of locking the CDR to within 40ppm of any sub-rate of the data (making it applicable for any sub-rate CDR architecture), while being immune to undesirable harmonic locking. This CDR also integrates a calibration loop to improve robustness to input duty cycle error.},

The receiver employs a half-rate 2-tap speculative DFE architecture with a far-end cross-talk (FEXT) cancellation technique. Figure 25.6.1 shows the top-level architecture of the DFE receiver. Conventionally, analog taps of the equalizer are implemented using current mode summers, thus the power consumption of the DFE increases proportion ally with the number of taps. In the proposed architecture, a switched-capacitor S/H is employed to sample the input signal and combine it with the feedback coefficients at the front-end of the receiver, as shown in Fig. 25.6.2 (S/H/summer). In this design, the switched-capacitor network is modified to support two taps of DFE without any signal loss. This technique can be further extended to realize more number of taps. The extra power due to sampling capacitors, switches and voltage-mode DACs is very small.},

abstract={As the panel technology continues to offer displays with higher resolution, greater color depth, and increased frame rate, the amount of video data to display driver ICs (DDIs) inside the panel keeps on expanding. Since the conventional intra-panel interfaces with multi-drop configurations, such as RSDS and mini-LVDS, increase the cost of overall systems at high bandwidth, new intra panel interfaces have been proposed to meet the bandwidth requirement with point-to-point configurations. This paper presents a new high-speed video interface that offers significant complexity reduction in the receiver. It is because receivers are integrated in a DDI with relatively slow high-voltage processes, while transmitters in host controllers are implemented with the more advanced deep-submicron processes. Compared to the PLL-based clock recovery circuits in [K. Yamguchi et al., 2009; I. Jung et al., 2009], the DLL-based data recovery circuit occupies a smaller area with lower power consumption and offers unconditionally stable characteristics along with higher jitter tolerance.},

abstract={RFID systems are based on backscattering communications, and this encourages research on how to guarantee a reliable RX performance under simultaneous TX/RX operation. To isolate RX from the TX self-jammer, the RFID transceivers are generally accompanied by an off-chip circulator or isolator. This has advantages in selectivity between tag signal and blocker, but it results in a low level of integration and bulky system. In addition, to meet the stringent linearity requirement, the RFID reader needs to adopt a linear PA with sufficient power back-off, which degrades a global efficiency. Considering that battery life time is the critical issue particularly for mobile applications, existing UHF RFID readers are unsuitable for the mobile RFID technology due to their low system efficiency and low integration level.},

abstract={Wireless body-area networks (WBAN) are used for communication among sensor nodes operating on, in or around the human body, e.g. for healthcare purposes. In view of energy autonomy, the total energy consumption of the sensor nodes should be minimized. Because of their low complexity, a combination of the super-regenerative (SR) principle [1-3] and OOK modulation enables ultra low power (ULP) consumption. This work presents a 2.4GHz ULP OOK single chip transceiver for WBAN applications. A block diagram of the implemented transceiver is shown in Fig. 26.3.1. Next to the direct modulation TX [4] and SR RF [5] front-ends, this work integrates analog and digital baseband, PLL functionality and additional programmability for flexible data rates, and achieves ultra-low power consumption for the overall system.},

abstract={The proliferation of location-based applications inside various handheld electronic devices, such as mobile phones and internet tablets, demands the GPS system to have low power consumption, small form-factor and be co-located on the same device with other radio systems, such as cellular, BT, and WLAN. The conventional GPS solution often uses two SAW filters, before and after an external LNA, to meet the requirements of low noise and multi-radio coexistence. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to remove the external LNA and interstage SAW filter due to size and cost, which presents a great design challenge to achieve high out-of-band linearity with very low power consumption. To fulfill these stringent requirements, a more comprehensive approach is needed to tar get a radio architecture with a proper RX system budgeting and optimal circuit design. In addition, a GPS system can be desensitized by unexpected in-band blockers generated from other subsystems on the same platform, such as LCD display, PMU, CPU system clocks, etc. The GPS digital baseband processor must possess the capability to withstand in-band blockers without significant performance degradation. This paper presents a GPS/Galileo SoC with an adaptive in-band blocker cancellation scheme, which is implemented in a 65nm CMOS process.},

abstract={Multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) have been shown to have improved jitter accumulation and tracking over VCO-based PLLs. By injecting the reference clock edge into the VCO at each reference cycle, an MDLL removes the accumulated jitter of the VCO. The principal challenge in MDLL design is to align the injected reference edge with the loop feedback signal. Timing mismatch between the reference edge and the VCO feedback edge, or offsets in the charge pump, would introduce a phase error in the injected edge. The error manifests as a period jitter or reference spur in the frequency domain. This effect limits the minimum jitter attained by the MDLL. In previously published techniques, a select logic block generates an SEL pulse to briefly open an aperture for reference injection. A necessary attribute of the SEL pulse is that it is sufficiently sharp and well-positioned to select the next reference edge. However, at high frequencies, the position of the SEL pulse impacts the delay of the MUX and hence introduces pattern jitter and spurs. This paper minimizes the spur by introducing a calibrated phase delay to properly position the SEL pulse with respect to the reference edge, and by minimizing the inherent error of the charge pump.},

abstract={In this paper, a prototype delta-sigma ADC is implemented in a 0.18μm 2P5M CMOS process. The input signal sampling capacitors are shared with the front-end DAC capacitors. The sampling frequency is 50MHz and oversampling ratio is 24. The out-of-band peaking is deliberately set to help the stability and to allow larger input signals to be processed by the loop. This modulator achieves 78.2dB peak SNDR and 79.3dB peak SNR while consuming 1.35mW analog and 1.55mW digital power from 1.5V supplies. The major portion of the digital power (1.3mW) is consumed by an overdesigned generic clock generator to provide flexibility in testing with various sampling frequencies. The rest of the digital power (0.25mW) includes the DLL, digital counter, DWA and the comparator. The achieved minimal analog power is the direct result of the extra order of noise shaping, and the elimination of the flash ADC and the typical large capacitive loading that comes with it. The FoM is 210fJ/conversion-step and it can easily be reduced further with redesign (i.e., eliminating the wasted clock generator power).},

abstract={Recently, high-resolution TDCs have gained more and more popularity due to their increasing implementation in digital PLLs, ADCs, jitter measurement and time-of-flight measurement units. Similar to ADCs, existing architectures of TDCs can be divided into several categories: flash TDCs, pipeline TDCs, and SAR TDCs. The highest achievable time resolution of a TDC is mainly limited by the CMOS gate delay. In order to achieve sub-gate-delay resolution, the Vernier method is commonly used. However, the mismatch problem caused by process variation limits its effectiveness, and the same holds for the time amplification method. The gated-ring-oscillator (GRO) method is introduced to achieve sub-ps time resolution, but it still requires an equivalent CMOS gate delay as low as 6ps. Upcoming applications in 4,h-generation nuclear reactors, space, and high-energy physics such as the large Hadron collider (LHC), require the TDC to achieve a high time resolution in harsh environments with high tem perature and radiation, where the threshold voltage, transconductance, and delay of a transistor undergo dramatic changes. In these cases, the high accu racy and robustness of the TDC need to be inherent to the design rather than by employing a fast CMOS technology.},

A relayed transmission scheme using one coil is proposed to reduce the number of coils in a data link. Coupled resonation is utilized for clock and data recovery (CDR) for the first time in the world, resulting in elimination of a source synchronous clock link. As a result, total number of coils needed to form a channel is reduced from 6 to 1, yielding the significant improvement in data rate, layout area and energy consumption.},

abstract={The expanding capacity of today's memory cards and increasing speed of processors have created demands for high data rate interfaces between memory cards and processors. Compared to conventional contact pins, wireless interfaces have received tremendous interest for reasons of more convenience, higher reliability, and higher data rate. Two major types of near-field wireless communication techniques using capacitive coupling and inductive coupling channels have been investigated. Tens of Gb/s/ch is achieved using both methods with a communication distance of tens of microns in TCI (thru-chip-interface) applications. However, when the communication distance Centers the mm range in such applications as non-contact memory cards, the sizes of capacitors or inductors must be up scaled to detect enough electrical flux or magnetic flux, whose magnitude decay as 1/dn (n>;1). As a result, the self-resonance frequency fSR is reduced significantly, which becomes the dominant limiting factor for the achievable data rate, since the maximum data rate is usually chosen as 1/2 or 1/3 of fSR in order to avoid signal peaking. Although multi-channel solutions are viable to increase the total data rate, complex systems are required to address the skew issues in synchronization, and low area efficiency is resulted to reduce crosstalk interferences.},

abstract={In this paper, first, we describe an impedance-matched bi-directional multi-drop (IMBM) DQ bus that can handle up to 4 slots, 8 drops at a data-rate of up to 4.8Gb/s. In the case of the SSTL DQ bus, the series resistor of Z0/2 can suppress ringing and attenuate reflections within the chan nel. But, the SSTL DQ bus is still not entirely free from reflections among the slots because the reflection coefficient of the SSTL DQ bus at the stub junctions is -1/4. However, the IMBM DQ bus that we propose makes the reflection coef ficient 0 as can be seen from the equations. Therefore, the IMBM DQ bus generates no reflection signal at each stub. Moreover, the IMBM DQ bus can send write signals of the same current level to every module according to its current division relation of lk and lk+1. The transceiver also receives the read signal from every module with the identical level, according to the reciprocity theorem. This characteristic produces identical transfer responses for all the modules regardless of their positions.},

abstract={Most DRAM interfaces such as GDDR5 and DDR3 use parallel single-ended signaling due to pin-count restriction and backward compatibility. Notwithstanding poor signal and power integrity issues, GDDR5 speed reached beyond 5Gb/s in recent years by utilizing data bus inversion, error-detection coding, data training and channel equalization. However, channel crosstalk is becoming a major barrier to further speed improvement. A common solution for channel crosstalk reduction at the system level is to use a shielding line or wide spacing between signal lines, but increasing the number of layers in a chip package and PCB increase system cost. To remove the shielding lines and increase speed, this paper presents a channel crosstalk equalizer with programmable signal ordering capability for the DRAM transmitter. In addition, this paper addresses tri-mode clocking to reduce the system jitter for better timing margin: PLL off, LC-PLL and injection-locked oscillator.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates a prototype of embedded DRAM using a standard NAND flash memory process. This embedded DRAM can replace on-chip SRAM page buffers and other caches with minimum cost to enhance NAND flash memory performance. This opens up a new technical direction and wide applications for NAND flash memories. Figure 28.9.2(a) shows the concept of the embedded DRAM. An obstacle to embed DRAM in a NAND flash memory chip is a lack of cell charge, because the cell capacitance Cs using a planar MOS capacitor is limited to 3fF at the highest, whereas that of an ordinary embedded DRAM is around 20fF by using extra trenched or stacked capacitor process steps. However, even with a small 3fF cell, a cell node bias up to 4V, which is 4 times as high as the ordinary DRAM bias by taking advantage of the high-voltage NAND flash process, and a low parasitic capacitance bitline of 60fF, together enable sufficient ±100mV cell signals. A memory cell is composed of a cell transistor and a depletion-type MOS capacitor, and the cell size is 1.5μnf. The large 4V bias to the cell node is realized by adopting a self-boost technique, which is widely used for the program inhibit of NAND flash memory. After writing the bitline BL voltage of 2V Vint for "1" data and 0V for "0" data into a cell node and pulling down the wordline WL from 3.4V Vpp to 2V Virιt, the plateline PL is boosted to 3.4V Vpp. Therefore, the cell node voltage of "1" data is self-boosted to around 4V due to cell transistor cut-off by negative Vgs-Vt, while that of "0" data is kept at ground due to cell transistor being turned-on.},

abstract={6T SRAMs have been the embedded memory of choice for modern microproces sors due to their logic compatibility, high speed, and refresh-free operation. The relatively large cell size and conflicting requirements for read and write at low operating voltages make aggressive scaling of 6T SRAMs challenging in sub 22nm. Recently, 1T1C embedded DRAMs (eDRAMs) have replaced SRAMs in several server applications reducing the cache area and improving performance. Difficulties in scaling the trench capacitor and the additional process steps involved in manufacturing the thick oxide access devices are currently limiting the wide spread adoption of 1T1C technology. Gain cells have features such as decoupled read and write paths, a nondestructive read, and a 2X higher bit-cell density than a 6T SRAM, making them a strong contender for future embedded memories. However, the boosted supplies needed for robust operation necessitates thick oxide devices to prevent gate reliability issues in gain cells. Although this would lead to a larger bit-cell size and decreased macro perform ance, these limitations have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we pres ent the following circuit techniques for realizing a truly logic compatible (i.e. thin oxide only implementation) gain cell eDRAM with no boosted supplies; (i) a 2T1C gain cell featuring a beneficial couple-up read and a preferential couple down write, (ii) a single-ended 7T SRAM to repair weak gain cells, and (iii) a storage voltage monitor capable of tracking PVT and cell retention time for adap tive refresh control.},

abstract={Internet users today have extremely high demands for bandwidth consuming content wherever they are and on multiple platforms, ranging from tiny screened phones to high-definition 3D home theaters. This has driven the rapid deployment of multiple broadband access solutions including legacy infrastructure driven DSL and cable, the almost limitless bandwidth provided by optical fiber to the home (FTTH), and the on-the-go appeal of wireless solutions including 3G/4G cellular or WiMAX. Over the past two decades, each of these technologies has successfully competed for the consumer's dollar, partly due to the differentiated ways data is accessed tel evisions were naturally connected to the CATV infrastructure and cell phones were linked to a wireless basestation. These traditional boundaries are blurring as cell phone calls are placed over WiFi networks and video content is delivered via an ISP. The common denominator is data access and the delivery method is irrelevant to the end user. As DSL continues to compete with cable and FTTH in the wireline space, more and more users are choosing wireless broadband solutions such as 3G, 4G, or WiMAX even for their home access. In this panel, we will review the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of the recent history of broadband evolution and provide a vision of the future. What are the pros and cons of each technology? Do we need so many competing solutions? What will be the successful business models in the future will everyone (or anyone) make money? Which ones will be the winners ten years from now? Experts from academia, chip suppliers, and broadband systems vendors will share their visions on future broadband markets and technologies. Take your seat and enjoy the debate.},

abstract={The move to 22/20nm comes at the cost of an increased level of leakage and variability that both technology and product developers need to address. Lithography, still at 193nm, uses liquid immersion, double patterning, mask and source optimization, and increasingly-restrictive design rules. High-k Metal Gate methods, targeted to reducing gate leakage and Gate-Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL), have proponents of Gate-First (IBM, GLOBALFOUNDRIES) and Gate-Last (TSMC, Intel), also using different metals for p-channel and n-channel for Vt adjust ment. Partially-depleted SOI continues to be promoted by IBM and GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Under consideration for possible later introduc tion at 22/20nm are EUV, multi-beam E-beam and finfets. R&D dollars are increasing, once at 12% of revenue in 1998, now at 18% in 2010. As product design costs rise, the number of projects is declining, needing more synchronization of process and design development. Restrictive design rules (unidirectional poly, no jogs, dummy insertion, structured layout), adaptive architectures and expanded design for manufacturability are needed to address variability. Accurate layout aware modeling for local variability, well proximity effects, STI stress (LOD) and gate implementation are needed. Design enablement and technology-design col laboration are increasingly emphasized.},

abstract={The performance of data converters has been pushed relentlessly over the years, leveraging advancements in scaling and design techniques that exploit the high density and speed of modern process technology. However, most of the underlying architectures in use today were conceived decades ago, and are nowadays regarded as fundamental in their nature. Were these architectures viewed as fundamental, potentially long lasting breakthroughs when they were first demonstrated? In this session, we bring together four pioneers of data converter design to review the invention and progression of the basic data converter architectures. Oversampling analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion has become the dominant approach in high-resolution, moderate-bandwidth interfaces. In the first talk, Bruce Wooley will review the beginnings of oversampling converters and discuss the various architectural refinements that have emerged over time. Our second talk will focus on two equally important developments of the 1970s and 1980s: charge-based A/D conversion and digital self-calibration. Hae-Seung Lee will examine these inventions in retrospect and explain why these techniques remain equally valuable today. In the third talk of this session, Stephen Lewis will lead us back to the early days of high-speed pipelined conversion. While today's pipelines can easily sample at several hundred megahertz, the challenge back then was to cope with the bandwidth of video signals. Pipelining the digitization enabled the designer to extract very high speeds from CMOS transistors that were relatively slow and still getting ready for prime time. The session concludes with a presentation from Doug Mercer on high-speed digital-to-analog converters, which will review design philosophy changes that occurred in the 1990s. With the emergence of broadband data communication, new application requirements came into play, forcing many designers of high-speed DACs back to the drawing board.},

In order to meet this demand, the electronic industry has to address the limitations of power consumption and form factor in the present solutions. Let us define gigabit class as physical layer data rate to be greater than 1Gb/s; while portability as the battery capacity limited to 25W-hour lithium polymer battery at 3.75V (similar to the Apple iPad) or about 1000mA-hour at 3.75V for a typical cellular phone. These devices offer different classes of multi-media experience, however, are both very popular among consumers. The key question is: how to be energy efficient in data-rate/power consumption for the Gb/s+device? For practical wireless application, the range needs to be at least a size of a room. In this special evening session, we have assembled a group of industrial experts in gigabit wireless communication to speak about their respective technology; and their views on how these standards can achieve lowest power AND highest data rate simultaneously. These standards include WirelessHD, Wireless Gigabit Alliance (802.11ad), 802.11ac and a proprietary short range radio. In addition, after 4 individual presentations, a panel discussion will be held to provide everyone in the session an opportunity to ask questions to these experts.},

abstract={A Smart Grid is a required infrastructure in the near future to meet the world's energy usage and generation demands. The US government has just injected 4.5B$ of stimulus into creating Smart Grid technologies, and this has created a huge momentum to implement the infrastructure today. With a variety of diverse renewable power sources (wind, wave, solar) and new challenging loads (e.g. electric vehicle) and usage models (e.g. peak shaving), the role of Smart Meters and communications among meters and appliances of your home is becoming increasingly important. As consumers are becoming more aware of their own economic and environmental responsibilities regarding green power consumption and generation, connecting their appliances in the home to the WWW will also open up new opportunities in Energy 2.0 applications independent of the traditional utility companies. This special topic session aims at introducing to the audience the market requirements and three of the key candidate technologies for the Smart Grid and Energy 2.0 application: accurate power metering, powerline communications, and low-power wireless communications for power management.},

abstract={Energy efficient VLSIs with an ultra-low voltage power supply down to 0.5V are in growing demand in various applications, e.g., secure card, sensor node, and medical systems where power is supplied by RF wave, solar cells and small batteries. Various technological challenges, including PVT variations, low operating voltage margin, increased stand-by power consumption and low driving current, must be addressed. This forum provides an overview of the technical challenges as well as most recent circuit advances in key building blocks for digital/analog VLSI applications. The forum starts with the overview on microprocessor design for smarphones. The microprocessor used in personal computers is redesigned and optimized, delivering over 2-4× performance in the smartphone power envelope. High performance and variability resistant device technologies are presented for low power and multimedia products operating at very low VDD. The forum also has three presentations to discuss the design challenges for logic and memory in scaled technologies with increased parameter variations. For the digital design, pitfalls in deep-low-voltage circuits are summarized with emphasis on VDDmin issues with experimental results. SRAM design trade-offs with respect to area, read/write stability, and access time are discussed for different applications. Embedded non-volatile memory with zero power is also presented. Design tradeoffs involved in building blocks for low-power signal path along with on-die voltage regulators are discussed. Key analog circuits such as low-voltage voltage generator, VCO, PLL, ADC and DAC are examined for voltage scaling. Conventional bangap reference is no longer feasibile down to 0.5V regime. Different low-voltage voltage generator circuits and their pros and cons will be discussed. The impact of VDD scaling on the various performance metrics for timing related circuits, such as voltage-controlled oscillators an- phase-locked loops is presented with an emphasis on their application in input/output interfaces. Low-voltage data converters are reviewed, covering the current status, enhancement solutions and future direction for higher energy efficiency.},

abstract={Energy efficiency today is one of the most important design criteria of high-performance processors for practically every application: whether the final chip dissipates more than 100 Watts for general purpose processing or a few Watts for application processing on a SoC and whether a single or multi core architecture is applied best practice design techniques to achieve high performance at low power are essentially the same. Design targets become more and more challenging with every new technology generation which shows with increasing variability how to keep energy efficiency high in every mode of operation, i.e. sleep, standby, regular, and peak performance. General techniques being applied here are gating, adaptivity, and calibration. Finally, in the future really successful improvements of energy efficiency will bring the dilemma that the classical "flexibility vs. energy conflict" is replaced by a new "energy vs. reliability conflict" due to an increasing rate of transient faults. The objective of this Forum is to present a comprehensive overview of energy efficient optimization methodologies for the different kinds of processors (general purpose / application / embedded SoC, single / multi core processors) and to give exemplary examples. While power optimization generally has to be performed at every design level and architectural components including memories this Forum focuses on micro-architecture, logic and circuit, down to the physical implementation level as well as state-of-the-art clocking and supply techniques. The Forum concludes with an outlook on future options, developments, challenges and issues; possible way-outs will be discussed.},

year={2011},

number={}, 
pages={522-523}, 
abstract={Multi-Gbps transceivers have evolved from what were once exotic special-purpose cells to ubiquitous building blocks that are expected to function as the glue bet ween critical compute, communications, and storage elements. As such they are expected to function flawlessly, interoperate cleanly, and consume little power, area, and system design mindshare. As part of the 'commoditizing' of transceivers, the pressure to achieve multiple standards compliance from individual designs has increased dramatically no longer are ASIC or system designers content with a single PHY for a single standard. The consequential impact on the design space means link designers must often 'right size' a swiss-army-knife design including power and area optimization; you don't want too many or too few 'blades'. Sometimes conflicting standards requirements can make customization and optimization a real challenge in this space. Jared Zerbe of Rambus will review some of the fundamental transceiver challenges and techniques used to address them, including a discussion of the impact of multi-standard compliance on the transceiver design effort and ultimate performance. Following this, Thomas Toifl of IBM will discuss the design challenges and solutions to data rates above 20Gb/s. Main challenges are achieving the required bandwidth with full ESD protection, the DFE loop timing, and overall design complexity. Marcus van lerssel of Snowbush IP will discuss implementation challenges and the benefits of a multi-standard PHY supporting Ethernet/PCIe/SATA/USB. Takeshi Horiefrom Fujitsu will present Ethernet standards and the technologies required to realize 10GB serial backplane transfer for 10GB Ethernet. When it comes to buidling standards compliant PHYs, IP providers face challenges that arise from the need to proliferate the design across many process geome tries/foundries and also from the large variability in customer's expertise in package design and signal integrity analysis. Dan Weinl- der of Synopsys will discuss how standards influence these challenges. The main focus of standards over the last few years has understandably been on addressing the bandwidth curve. The need to address the rising power struggle of SoCs is usually recognized, but limited to simple power targets. The final two presentations in this forum will focus on energy efficiency by Fulvio Spagna of Intel and on low-power solutions by Anthony Sanders of Lantiq.},

The Phase-locked loop (PLL) is the most suitable circuit architecture to perform the extremely diverse tasks required by the very different applications. In wireless transceivers, PLLs are used to generate high-frequency local oscillator signals with extremely low phase noise for up-conversion and down-conversion of the transmitted and received signals. For high-speed data communications very low-jitter clock signals are required. When used as clock generators for large processors, wide frequency range, fast locking time and very-low-power quiescent dissipation are absolutely mandatory. These tough specifications need to be achieved at the lowest possible power, both for the stringent requirements of portable systems, but also to reduce the issues associated with heat dissipation.},

There are always people proclaiming that the end of NAND is just around the corner, but that corner seems like a mirage. In the meanwhile, the emerging memories are not sitting idle either.

abstract={Summary form only given. Integration rules. Why? Here's why. The number of transistors available on a die continues to grow in line with Moore's law. In the previous decade, designers hit a wall in terms of how to make a single core processor utilize the available transistors efficiently. So they added larger caches. When the performance advantages of these caches flat-lined, they added multiple processor cores. This trend has dominated the industry for many years. Until now. A revolutionary shift is underway.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Next-generation low-power applications such as biological signal processing, energy scavenging and wireless communications require new technologies and circuit techniques to achieve the lowest energy-per-operation. These applications are driving new techniques for efficient on-die clock generation, level conversion, non-volatile storage, low-power clocking, and reliable low-voltage operation. Energy-efficient systems must be optimized to maximize the utility of power shut down during idle and low-activity periods while also maintaining low-energy operation and high throughput during active modes to meet performance targets. The papers selected for this session highlight technology enhancements, novel circuit techniques, and system designs targeting these goals.},

pages={344-345}, 
abstract={Summary form only given. Transceivers designed for very high-speed wireline communication must contend with significant channel loss, crosstalk, and reflections by employing various equalization techniques in the transmitter and receiver. Confronting these challenges becomes even more difficult as data rates increase beyond 10Gb/s and designs become power-constrained. The first four papers in this session describe transceivers that address these concerns. The remaining papers describe key building blocks for next-generation transceivers with a focus on various receive equalizer adaptation techniques and spread-spectrum clock generation for EMI reduction.},

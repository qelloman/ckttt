abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time ΔΣ modulator targeted at optimizing power efficiency for input bandwidth exceeding 50 MHz. Delay in the feedback path is carefully minimized and traditional techniques for DAC mismatch correction and excess loop delay compensation are both replaced with digital schemes. Power is also minimized by relaxing loop filter BW requirements and using a power efficient opamp topology. The modulator achieves 73 dB dynamic range (DR) in 80 MHz BW while consuming 23 mW. The peak SNR is 70 dB and the peak SNDR is 67.5 dB, resulting in FOMs of 168 dB and 163 dB based on DR and SNDR, respectively.},

abstract={A DC-DC converter, which tracks minimum power loss under various conditions, is presented in this paper.

volume={50}, 
number={2}, 
pages={527-542}, 
abstract={This paper presents a four-element phased-array receiver which achieves 38% fractional bandwidth around 55 GHz. Baseband phase-shifting is employed to eliminate wideband phase-shifters, power dividers, and quadrature splitters operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. Antenna weighting and combining are accomplished using a highly digital Cartesian phase-shifter and current summation, respectively. Transformer-coupling techniques are introduced in the LNA to simultaneously achieve wide bandwidth, reduced noise figure, gain boosting and neutralization. Cascode-free and folded topologies are used throughout to enable operation from a scalable supply voltage. To overcome challenges associated with wideband LO distribution, the LO network employs multiconductor transmission lines to distribute four-phase LO signals. The LO distribution network is absorbed into the LO buffers and terminated by distributed LC loads near the I/Q mixers in each phased-array element. The phased-array receiver is fabricated in a 45 nm SOI CMOS process and achieves 26.2 dB (20.2 dB) of element gain over 21 GHz (19 GHz) of 3 dB bandwidth with 5.5 dB/9.8 dB (7.7 dB/12 dB) minimum/maximum NF while dissipating 30 mW/element (14 mW/element) from a 1.1 V (0.6 V) supply voltage. The worst case -1 dB (input) compression is -28 dBm at 1.1 V. A worst case coupling of 26 dB (45 dB) is measured between adjacent (nonadjacent) elements. The IF bandwidth is 1.2 GHz, limited by the wirebond and PCB interface to the chip. The design occupies only 0.225 mm 2 per element including LO buffer/distribution.},

volume={50}, 
number={4}, 
pages={1070-1079}, 
abstract={Hardware-based computer vision accelerators will be an essential part of future mobile devices to meet the low power and real-time processing requirement. To realize a high energy efficiency and high throughput, the accelerator architecture can be massively parallelized and tailored to vision processing, which is an advantage over software-based solutions and general-purpose hardware. In this work, we present an ASIC that is designed to learn and extract features from images and videos. The ASIC contains 256 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons connected in a scalable two-layer network of 8 × 8 grids linked in a 4-stage ring. Sparse neuron activation and the relatively small grid keep the spike collision probability low to save access arbitration. The weight memory is divided into core memory and auxiliary memory, such that the auxiliary memory is only powered on for learning to save inference power. High-throughput inference is accomplished by the parallel operation of neurons. Efficient learning is implemented by passing parameter update messages, which is further simplified by an approximation technique. A 3.06 mm2 65 nm CMOS ASIC test chip is designed to achieve a maximum inference throughput of 1.24 Gpixel/s at 1.0 V and 310 MHz, and on-chip learning can be completed in seconds. To improve the power consumption and energy efficiency, core memory supply voltage can be reduced to 440 mV to take advantage of the error resilience of the algorithm, reducing the inference power to 6.67 mW for a 140 Mpixel/s throughput at 35 MHz.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2188-2198}, 
abstract={Current-mode sense amplifiers (CSA) are commonly used in eNVM, because of their fast read speed at large bitline (BL) loads and small cell read currents. However, conventional CSAs are unable to achieve fast random read access time (TAC), due to significant summed input offsets (IOS-SUM) at read-path. This work proposes a calibration-based asymmetric-voltage-biased CSA (AVB-CSA) to suppress IOS-SUM and enable high-speed sensing without the need for run-time offset-cancellation operations. This work then fabricated two 90 nm AVB-CSA 1 Mb Flash testchips (with and without BL-length test-modes). The AVB-CSA eFlash macros with 512 rows achieved TAC of 3.9 ns at nominal VDD (1.2 V). The BL-length test-mode experiments confirmed a 1.53× improvement in TAC using AVB-CSA with a BL-length of 2048-rows operating at VDD=0.8 V.},

pages={2524-2532}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a monolithic capacitor-current-controlled hysteretic buck converter with a transient-optimized feedback circuit (TOFC) for compact-sized portable devices. The proposed TOFC simultaneously optimizes both load and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) transient responses to minimize output voltage undershoot/overshoot and settling time. In addition, a transient-hold (TH) technique, which prevents transient response optimization from being affected by the error amplifier without increasing the compensation capacitance, is also proposed to save chip area. This work is implemented in a 0.35 μm CMOS process with a chip area of 0.88 mm 2 . Measurement results show that, for a 500 mA load transient, the output voltage settles in 0.9 μs with an undershoot/overshoot of less than 35 mV. For a 0.6-V DVS transient, output voltage settles in 3 μs with negligible undershoot/overshoot. Moreover, 96% peak efficiency is measured at 500 mW output power.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1382-1398}, 
abstract={This paper describes a single-channel, calibration-free Successive-Approximation-Register (SAR) ADC with a resolution of 10 bits at 240 MS/s. A DAC switching technique and an addition-only digital error correction technique based on the non-binary search are proposed to tackle the static and dynamic non-idealities attributed to capacitor mismatch and insufficient DAC settling. The conversion speed is enhanced, and the power and area of the DAC are also reduced by 40% as a result. In addition, a switching scheme lifting the input common mode of the comparator is proposed to further enhance the speed. Moreover, the comparator employs multiple feedback paths for an enhanced regeneration strength to alleviate the metastable problem. Occupying an active area of 0.003 mm 2 and dissipating 0.68 mW from 1 V supply at 240 MS/s in 28 nm CMOS, the proposed design achieves an SNDR of 57 dB with low-frequency inputs and 53 dB at the Nyquist input. This corresponds to a conversion efficiency of 4.8 fJ/c.-s. and 7.8 fJ/c.-s. respectively. The DAC switching technique improves the INL and DNL from +1.15/-1.01 LSB and +0.92/-0.28 LSB to within +0.55/-0.45 LSB and +0.45/-0.23 LSB, respectively. This ADC is at least 80% smaller and 32% more power efficient than reported state-of-the-art ADCs of similar resolutions and Nyquist bandwidths larger than 75 MHz.},

abstract={On-chip jitter measurement can be used to optimize the performance of wireline transceivers. In this work, the jitter of random data is measured on-chip by correlating the phase detector outputs from two adjacent CDR lanes. This allows the jitter's autocorrelation function to be estimated, from which the jitter's RMS value and power spectral density are extracted without using any external reference clock. The RMS value of random jitter ranging from 0.85 ps to 1.89 ps, and sinusoidal jitter from 0.89 ps to 5.1 ps is measured in PRBS31 data with less than 0.6 ps of error compared to measurements by an 80 GS/s real-time oscilloscope. Correlating the phase detectors in the CDRs with a third phase detector, which measures the phase difference between the clocks recovered by the two CDRs, allows measurement of the recovered clock jitter. Sinusoidal jitter from 1.8 ps to 5.3 ps is measured in the recovered clock with an error of less than 1 ps.},

abstract={For better area and power efficiencies, rail-to-rail-output single-stage amplifiers are a potential replacement of their multi-stage counterparts, especially for display applications that entail massive buffer amplifiers in their column drivers. This paper describes a nested-current-mirror (NCM) technique for a single-stage amplifier to achieve substantial enhancements of DC gain, gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew rate (SR). Specifically, NCM is customizable for different mirror steps, and sub mirror ratios, to balance the performance metrics and capacitive-load ( CL) drivability, avoiding any compensation passives while preserving a rail-to-rail output swing. Analytical treatments of the NCM technique in terms of performance limits and robustness reveal that the NCM amplifier can surpass the fundamental power-efficiency limit set by the basic differential-pair (DP) amplifier. Two prototypes, 3-step and 4-step NCM amplifiers, were fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS for systematic comparison with the DP amplifier. The former represents a robust design exhibiting 72 dB DC gain and 0.0028-0.27 MHz GBW over 0.15-15 nF CL with 80 ° phase margin (PM). The latter embodies an aggressive design attaining 84 dB DC gain and 0.013-1.24 MHz GBW over 0.15-15 nF CL with 62 ° PM. All amplifiers were sized for the same area (0.0013 mm 2) and power (3.6 μW).},

abstract={A dual-slope capacitance-to-digital converter for pressure-sensing is presented and demonstrated in a complete microsystem. The design uses base capacitance subtraction with a configurable capacitor bank to narrow down input capacitance range and reduce conversion time. An energy-efficient iterative charge subtraction method is proposed, employing a current mirror that leverages the 3.6 V battery supply available in the system. We also propose dual-precision comparators to reduce comparator power while maintaining high accuracy during slope conversion, further improving energy efficiency. The converter occupies 0.105 mm 2 in 180 nm CMOS and achieves 44.2 dB SNR at 6.4 ms conversion time and 110 nW of power, corresponding to 5.3 pJ/conv-step FoM. The converter is integrated with a pressure transducer, battery, processor, power management unit, and radio to form a complete 1.4 mm × 2.8 mm × 1.6 mm pressure sensor system aimed at implantable devices. The multi-layer system is implemented in 180 nm CMOS. The system was tested for resolution in a pressure chamber with an external 3.6 V supply and serial communication bus, and the measured resolution of 0.77 mmHg was recorded. We also demonstrated the wireless readout of the pressure data on the stack system operating completely wirelessly using an integrated battery.},

A high-order load impedance with multiple resonant elements is often used to realize wideband amplifiers. However, these implementations require the use of numerous inductors which occupy a prohibitively large amount of silicon area. A mirror-symmetric Norton transformation technique which reduces inductor component values for a wideband amplifier, allowing an area-efficient layout, is described in this paper.

abstract={This paper presents a single-inductor dual-input- tri-output buck-boost (DITOBB) converter that manages energy harvesting, energy storage, and power rail regulation of an indoor remote sensor system. The converter operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and regulates the outputs with a combination of pulse-skipping modulation (PSM) and constant-ON-time pulse-frequency modulation (PFM). To reduce the quiescent power, all the circuit blocks are turned OFF when the outputs are within regulation, except a system clock generator. A newly designed relaxation oscillator provides the main clock of the system, which requires neither reference voltages nor comparators. The frequency of the system clock doubles or halves based on the states of the sources and outputs following a proposed algorithm. The DITOBB converter has been designed and fabricated using 0.18 μm CMOS process. With a quiescent power of 400 nW, the designed DITOBB converter shows a measured peak efficiency of 83% at 100 μW output power.},

abstract={A piezoelectric (PE) energy harvesting system with one-cycle maximum power point (MPP) sensing is presented. The one-cycle MPP sensing method uses a very small size sensing capacitor and it can make the transducer output voltage reach the open circuit voltage within one cycle. The proposed MPP sensing block can sense the open circuit voltage with a proposed peak detector and stores the MPP voltage using charge sharing blocks. The one-cycle MPP sensing approach simplifies the design of an MPP tracking algorithm and greatly reduces the tracking time. All control blocks are self-biased and choose the higher voltage between the input or output voltages of the switching converter as a supply voltage (V DD). Therefore, a voltage multiplexer and a low-power ramp generator with V DD independence are also proposed to control the system without additional DC to DC converter. The entire system has been implemented in a 0.35 μm BCDMOS process. It operates at 90 kHz with a 10-mH inductor. The total power dissipation of the controller is 10 μW at a V DD of 2.7 V. The MPP tracking time is only 9.09 ms/V when the input voltage of the switching converter is changed from 3.4 V to 1.2 V.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a power- and area-efficient, high-performance dual-path receiver analog front-end (AFE) for wide multistandard applications of 8.5-11.5 Gb/s, such as 10GBASE-LRM, 10GBASE-KR, 10GBASE-CX1, and 10GBASE-LR/SR. A common programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with programmable peaking is followed by ADC-based and slicer-based paths. The ADC-based path employs a low-power, 6-bit 10 Gs/s, 4X time-interleaved, low BER rectified flash 10 Gs/s ADC that is digitally calibrated to compensate for offset, gain, and phase mismatches between the interleaved channels. The ADC-based receiver with transmitter can compensate for up to a 34 dB insertion loss at 5 GHz Nyquist frequency for a copper backplane channel (10GBASE-KR). The ADC-based receiver can achieve greater than 6 dB margin for three 10GBASE-LRM stressors and dynamic channels. The ADC Figure of Merit (FoM) is a 0.59 pJ/conversion-step for a 5 GHz input at a 10.3125 GHz clock rate. The slicer-based path uses a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) after high linear PGA to provide 10 dB total equalization at 5 GHz Nyquist frequency for 10GBASE-SR application. Its measured input sensitivity of 30 mVppd and high-frequency jitter tolerance of 0.35 UIpp with 0.7 UIpp total input jitter well exceed specifications in the standard. The receiver AFE occupies 0.82 mm 2 and consumes 195 mW for ADC path and 55 mW for slicer path in a 40 nm standard CMOS process.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2560-2571}, 
abstract={This paper describes a direct-conversion E-band transmitter (TX) in 40 nm bulk CMOS. As millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) circuits are vulnerable to process variations including the mismatch between interconnects, this E-band TX design is conducted in a layout floor-plan oriented way. Compact and symmetrical floor-plans of poly-phase filter (PPF) and I/Q modulator are presented in this work to suppress the LO feed-through (LOFT) and I/Q imbalance over both 71-76 and 81-86 GHz bands. In addition, a systematic design methodology is proposed for the mm-Wave PPF to reduce required EM simulations. The calibration methods used in this design are easy to implement for further reducing LOFT and I/Q imbalance with negligible impact on other TX performance metrics. The 0.225 mm 2 E-band TX achieves a measured output power of 12 dBm and efficiency of 15% with about 15 GHz bandwidth. It features an uncalibrated I/Q imbalance of less than 30 dB from 62.5 to 85.5 GHz.

abstract={In this paper, we present a 23 dBm PWM based fully digital transmitter designed in standard 45 nm CMOS process. The digital transmitter utilizes sigma-delta modulation and pulse-width modulation to convert high resolution baseband I and Q signals into 3-level switching signals, thereby allowing efficient Class-D PA stages to be used. In addition, cascaded sigma-delta stages and switched-capacitor combining are incorporated into the architecture to significantly reduce the out-of-band quantization noise while maintaining excellent efficiency. The proposed transmitter is fully digital from baseband to RF and can be used to replace the entire analog/RF signal chain in a traditional transmitter. It achieves peak output power of 23 dBm with 47% power-added efficiency (PAE). For an 20 MHz OFDM signal with 8.2 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAR), the PAE is 23%.

year={2015},

pages={3065-3076}, 
abstract={A fully integrated transmitter architecture operating in the charge-domain with incremental signaling is presented. The architecture provides improved out-of-band noise performance, thanks to an intrinsic low-pass noise filtering capability, reduced quantization noise scaled by capacitance ratios, and sinc 2 alias attenuation due to a quasi-linear reconstruction interpolation. With a respective unit and baseband capacitances of 2 fF and 45 pF, the architecture attains a potential 14 bit equivalent quantization noise with a 1024 unit capacitance array. Using four 10 bit charge-based DACs (QDACs) at 128 MS/s sampling rate, it achieves -155 dBc/Hz at 45 MHz offset from a 1 GHz modulated carrier. The incremental-charge-based operation also leads to an improved efficiency at back-off conditions. For an average output power of 1 dBm (20 MHz BW), total power consumption is 41.3 mW, of which only 0.5 mW corresponds to the system charge intake. The prototype is implemented using a 28 nm 0.9 V CMOS technology, with a core area of 0.25 mm 2 . With a reduced sampling frequency and number of bits, power and area consumption are among the best and will directly benefit from future technology scaling .},

volume={50},

pages={2074-2089}, 
abstract={Spread-spectrum clocking is an established approach to mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) of digital circuits, by intentionally sweeping the clock frequency. In this way, the energy of each clock harmonic is spread over a larger bandwidth, thereby reducing the peak of the interfering spectrum. This paper describes an highly flexible all-digital spread-spectrum clock generator (SSCG) realized with a standard-cells design flow. The developed circuit supports discontinuous frequency modulation profiles (with improved EMI reduction capability) and features reduced output jitter, due to delay interpolators and digital compensation of delay path asymmetries. The proposed SSCG is ideally suited for complex system on chips applications, having programmable spreading parameters, frequency synthesis capability and reduced recovery time to support local standby modes. The SSCG is implemented in bulk 28 nm CMOS technology, presents a maximum working frequency of 3.3 GHz and less than 3.2 ps rms output jitter. The measured peak level reduction of the clock power spectrum, at 1.0 GHz output frequency, is 27.0 dB with a 10% modulation depth. The power dissipation is 29.3 mW @ 3.3 GHz and the area occupation is 0.031 mm.},

abstract={This paper presents a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based current to digital converter for sensor readout applications. Second order noise shaping of the quantization error is achieved by using implicit capacitance of the sensor to realize a passive integrator and a VCO-based quantizer. The non-linearity in voltage to frequency conversion of the VCO is tackled by placing the VCO in a loop consisting of a simple digital IIR filter and a passive integrator. The IIR filter provides large gain within the signal bandwidth and suppresses VCO input swing. As a result, non-linearity of the VCO is not exercised, thus greatly improving the proposed architecture's immunity to VCO nonlinearity. The use of a digital filter instead of an analog loop filter eases the design and makes it scaling friendly. Designed for an ambient light sensor application, the proposed circuit achieves 900 pA accuracy over an input current range of 4 μA. Fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process, the readout circuit consumes a total of 77.8 μA current, and occupies an active area of 0.36 mm2.},

In this ADC, high-speed open-loop dynamic amplifiers with a common-mode detection technique are used as residue amplifiers to increase the ADC's speed, to enhance the robustness against supply voltage scaling, and to realize clock-scalable power consumption. To mitigate the absolute gain constraint of the residue amplifiers in a pipeline ADC, the interpolated pipeline architecture is employed to shift the gain requirement from absolute to relative accuracy. To show the new requirements of the residue amplifiers, the effects of gain mismatch and nonlinearity of the dynamic amplifiers are analyzed. The 7 bit prototype ADC fabricated in 90 nm CMOS demonstrates an ENOB of 6.0 bits at a conversion rate of 160 MS/s with an input close to the Nyquist frequency. At this conversion rate, it consumes 2.43 mW from a 0.55 V supply. The resulting FoM of the ADC is 240 fJ/conversion-step.},

title={A 5.8 nW CMOS Wake-Up Timer for Ultra-Low-Power Wireless Applications}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1754-1763}, 
abstract={This work presents an ultra-low-power oscillator designed for wake-up timers in compact wireless sensors. In a conventional relaxation oscillator, a capacitor periodically resets to a fixed voltage using a continuous comparator, thereby generating an output clock. The reset is triggered by a continuous comparator and thus the clock period is dependent on the delay of the continuous comparator which therefore needs to be fast compared to the period, making this approach power hungry. To avoid the power penalty of a fast continuous comparator, a constant charge subtraction scheme is proposed in this paper. As a constant amount of charge is subtracted for each cycle, rather than discharging/charging the capacitor to a fixed voltage, the clock period becomes independent of comparator delay. Therefore, the high power continuous comparator can be replaced with a coarse clocked comparator, facilitating low-power time tracking. For precise wake-up signal generation, an accurate continuous comparator is only enabled for one clock period at the end of the specified wakeup time. A wake-up timer using the proposed scheme is fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. The timer consumes 5.8 nW at room temperature with temperature stability of 45 ppm/°C (-10 °C to 90 °C) and line sensitivity of 1%/V (1.2 V to 2.2 V) .},

abstract={This paper presents a single-chip digital-intensive polar transmitter for WCDMA and WLAN integrating a low-phase-noise all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), a digitally-controlled wideband phase/amplitude modulator, and a calibration-free high-linearity power amplifier. From the ADPLL, the 1.7-2.5 GHz LO signal is generated together with a ÷1.5 frequency divider to eliminate DCO pulling. The phase noise of the ADPLL is optimized by using a linearized stochastic TDC with 3 ps resolution and a Class-C quadrature DCO (QDCO) with embedded quadrature phase shifter and quantization-noise filter. A 2-segment ΣΔ switching phase modulator enhances the PM bandwidth up to 200 MHz, and a digital polar amplifier employs AM-replica linearization to eliminate AM pre-distortion. The TX achieves a -1 dB output compression point of 22.8 dBm with an overall system efficiency of 27.6% and measures EVM of 4% for a 20 MHz 64-QAM signal at an output power of 13.8 dBm.},

abstract={A simple and robust “cell-based” method is presented for the design of variable-gain amplifiers (VGAs). The proposed unit cell utilizes a unique gain compensation method and achieves accurate dB-linear characteristic across a wide tuning range with low power consumption and wide bandwidth. Several such highly dB-linear unit cells can be cascaded to provide the required gain range for a VGA. To prove the concept, single-cell, 5-cell, 10-cell and 15-cell reconfigurable VGAs were fabricated in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the 10-cell VGA achieves a gain range of 38.6 dB with less than 0.19 dB gain error. The 15-cell VGA can either be used as reconfigurable VGA for analog control voltage or tunable PGA for digital control stream, with the flexibility of scaling gain range, gain error/step and power consumption. For the VGA at highest gain setting, it consumes 1.12 mW and achieves a gain range of 56 dB, gain error less than 0.3 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a 6 Gb/s transceiver with a nonlinear electronic dispersion compensator (EDC) for a directly modulated distributed-feedback (DM-DFB) laser. At the laser output, a DM-DFB laser induces power-dependent frequency chirp, which causes severe chromatic dispersion as well as pattern dependency on the received signal. Such time-varying nature of the dispersion increases the difficulty of compensation using conventional linear methods. The proposed EDC overcomes the chirp-induced dispersion via a nonlinear equalizer at the receiver and a pattern-dependent pre-compensator at the transmitter. The EDC achieves an optical SNR gain of 14.69 dB at a BER of 1 ×10 - 6 in a 75 km SMF-28 fiber. The test chip is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, and the EDC consumes 68 mW from a 1 V supply at 6 Gb/s.},

abstract={For RRAM to be a cost-competitive candidate for high-density and high-capacity commercial products, some architectural-level challenges must be tackled. In this paper, research results that advance the design of high-density RRAM arrays are presented. We first focus on the scaling effects of on-chip interconnects on RRAM array performance. Due to the continuously shrinking process feature size, the voltage drop along the interconnect gradually reduces the voltage available to operate the RRAM device. To more efficiently analyze this effect for an arbitrary array size, a compact array model is developed. Simulations using this model determine the maximum achievable array size for future technology nodes. A compact, one-transistor-N-RRAM (1TNR) array architecture, with corresponding read/write and decoding schemes, that achieves high RRAM density is then introduced. A proof-of-concept 1T4R test chip with fully integrated RRAM devices is described. For this test chip, a particular sequence to form the cross-point RRAM array is presented. Measurement results of successful array operations demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed high-density architecture.},

pages={399-413}, 
abstract={This paper describes a low-power 100 Gigabit Ethernet transceiver IC compliant with IEEE802.3ba 100GBASE-LR4 in 40 nm CMOS. The proposed bidirectional full-duplex transceiver IC contains a total of eight 28 Gb/s CDRs. Each CDR lane incorporates phase-rotator-based delay- and phase-locked loop (D/PLL) architecture for enhanced jitter filtering. All the CDR lanes operate independently while sharing a single voltage-controlled oscillator and supporting referenceless clock acquisition. To reduce power consumption, a multidrop clock distribution scheme with single on-chip transmission-line (T-line) and quadrate RX and TX schemes without CML logic gates are incorporated. Embedded built-in self-test modules featuring a random accumulation jitter generator enables bit error rate (BER) and jitter tolerance self tests without any external equipment. The TX featuring a three-tap pre-emphasis provides a variable output swing ranging from 478 mVppd to 1.06 Vppd. RX equalizers employing a continuous-time linear equalizer and a one-tap decision feedback equalizer compensate for the channel loss up to 25 dB at the Nyquist rate. The measured RX input sensitivity for a BER of 10 -12 is 42 mVppd. The proposed IC consumes only 0.87 W at 28.0 Gb/s with a BER less than 10 -15 on PRBS31 testing. The power efficiency of the proposed transceiver is 3.9 mW/Gb/s, which is the best among the efficiencies achieved by recently published 25 Gb/s transceivers.},

abstract={A reconfigurable receiver that can support dual-carrier aggregation is demonstrated. Switched Capacitor (SC) technique is explored at the receiver front-end for direct RF signal conditioning. By changing the connections of the switches and capacitors, various filtering profiles, including bandpass and notch functions, can be synthesized. On the other hand, complex-domain signal processing enables RF selectivity with controllable offset frequency relative to the LO frequency. Therefore, multiple RF channels can be selected simultaneously by multiple complex-domain signal processors and a shared single front-end. The scheme also enables a 4th-order RF bandpass transfer function by combining two 2nd-order bandpass transfer functions with slightly different center frequencies. In this work, a combination of a reconfigurable front-end passive SC network and two concurrent complex-domain signal processors enables the receiver to handle different signal scenarios. A proof-of-concept CMOS chip fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology is presented that supports single-channel and dual-carrier aggregation receiving modes. The receiver covers the frequency range from 0.1 to 1 GHz. The frequency distance between two concurrent RF channels can be tuned anywhere between 0 to +100 MHz. The near-band blocker resilience is improved by 15 dB when the front-end is configured as a notch filter.},

abstract={A field-programmable (FP) low-noise amplifier (LNA) with interferer-reflecting (IR) loop is introduced. The user can program its gain, noise figure, linearity and power consumption during operation. The IR loop uses a frequency-selective shunt-shunt feedback around the noise-canceling LNA to reduce the input impedance out of band and to suppress the input voltage swing created by blockers. A notch filter at the desired operation frequency in the feedback path results in selectivity at the RF input so that all out-of-band blockers are suppressed without the need to know blocker locations and the LNA input linearity is improved. 65 nm CMOS chip prototypes have been implemented with on-chip LC, bondwire LC or N-path notch filters. The FP N-path IR-LNA operates from 0.2 to 1.6 GHz; with the IR disabled, the NF is 2.4 dB, B1 dB is -15 dBm, and the OOB-IIP3 is +2.5 dBm with a 13 mW power consumption; with the IR on, the NF is 3.6 dB, the RF channel input bandwidth is 20 MHz, the B1 dB is -4 dBm and the OOB-IIP3 is +14.5 dBm.

abstract={A 13.56 MHz wireless power transfer system with a 1X/2X reconfigurable resonant regulating (R 3) rectifier and wireless power control for biomedical implants is presented. Output voltage regulation is achieved through two mechanisms: (1) a local PWM loop at the secondary side controls the duty cycle of mode-switching of the rectifier between the 1X and 2X modes; and (2) a global control loop obtains the mode-switching information from the secondary side and send it back to the primary side through the wireless channel and adjusts the transmitter power of the primary coil to adapt to load and coupling variations. Two novel backscattering uplink techniques are proposed for fast and energy-efficient data feedback. The first is for general data transmission using Manchester code; and the second is for fast duty cycle feedback to cater for fast load-transient responses. Stability analysis of the entire system with the two control loops is also presented. The primary transmitter and the secondary R 3 rectifier are fabricated in 0.35 μm CMOS process with the digital control circuits implemented using FPGA. The measured maximum received power and receiver efficiency are 102 mW and 92.6%, respectively. For load transients, the overshoot and the undershoot are approximately 110 mV and the settling times are less than 130 μs.},

number={4}, 
pages={867-881}, 
abstract={A digital fractional-N PLL that employs a high resolution TDC and a truly ΔΣ fractional divider to achieve low in-band noise with a wide bandwidth is presented. The fractional divider employs a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to cancel out ΔΣ quantization noise in time domain, thus alleviating TDC dynamic range requirements. The proposed digital architecture adopts a narrow range low-power time-amplifier based TDC (TA-TDC) to achieve sub 1 ps resolution. By using TA-TDC in place of a BBPD, the limit cycle behavior that plagues BB-PLLs is greatly suppressed by the TA-TDC, thus permitting wide PLL bandwidth. The proposed architecture is also less susceptible to DTC nonlinearity and has faster settling and tracking behavior compared to a BB-PLL. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype PLL achieves better than -106 dBc/Hz in-band noise and 3 MHz PLL bandwidth at 4.5 GHz output frequency using 50 MHz reference. The PLL consumes 3.7 mW and achieves better than 490 fsrms integrated jitter. This translates to a FoMJ of -240.5 dB, which is the best among the reported fractional-N PLLs.},

abstract={This work presents an 11 GS/s 1.1 GHz bandwidth interleaved ΔΣ DAC in 65 nm CMOS for the 60 GHz radio baseband. The high sample rate is achieved by using a two-channel interleaved MASH 1-1 architecture with a 4 bit output resulting in a predominantly digital DAC with only 15 analog current cells. Two-channel interleaving allows the use of a single clock for the logic and the multiplexing which requires each channel to operate at half sampling rate of 5.5 GHz. To enable this, a look-ahead technique is proposed that decouples the two channels within the integrator feedback path thereby improving the speed as compared to conventional loop-unrolling. Measurement results show that the ΔΣ DAC achieves a 53 dB SFDR, -49 dBc IM3 and 39 dB SNDR within a 1.1 GHz bandwidth while consuming 117 mW from 1 V digital/1.2 V analog supplies.

abstract={This work presents a power- and area-efficient three-stage amplifier that is able to drive a large capacitive load. Removing the inner Miller capacitor and employing cascode Miller compensation in the outer compensation loop could extend the complex-pole frequency of a three-stage amplifier, but result in a high Q-factor. A local impedance attenuation block consisting of a series RC network is proposed to control the complex poles. This block attenuates the high-frequency resistance at the second-stage output and achieves an optimized tradeoff between the frequency and the Q-factor of the complex poles. As the low-frequency resistance remains unchanged, a high dc gain is maintained. Implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS process, the proposed design occupies an area of 0.0032 mm2 and consumes a quiescent current of 10.5 μA. When driving a 560 pF capacitive load, it achieves a unity-gain frequency of 3.49 MHz, an average slew rate of 0.86 V/ μs, and an average settling time of 0.9 μs.},

abstract={This paper presents an original mmW frequency multiplier that provides the channel center frequencies of the IEEE 802.15.3c standard from a much lower and fixed frequency of 2.16 GHz. It is composed of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) whose supply is periodically switched on-and-off by the input signal, providing Periodically Repeated Oscillations Train (PROT). This multi-harmonic signal is injected into an oscillator (ILO) that locks onto the harmonic of interest, providing a continuous wave sinusoidal signal in the 60 GHz band. The CMOS 40 nm circuit consumes 32 mW and occupies only 0.07 mm 2. A theoretical approach on the synchronization of the PROT signal generator and the ILO is proposed, based on custom approximated solutions of the Van der Pol oscillator and highlighting new synchronization phenomena. Based on this theory, this novel programmable multiplication technique requires a unique fixed low frequency reference to perform multi-channel mmW LO generation. The phase noise of the output LO signal is only limited by the input low frequency reference phase noise and the frequency ratio between the output and the input signals. Thus, a 60 GHz signal has been generated with this technique with a record phase noise of -104 dBc/Hz@1 MHz offset.},

number={3}, 
pages={669-678}, 
abstract={This paper describes a link margin enhancement method for high data rate impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transceiver systems. To overcome a trade-off between link margin and spectrum compliance in the pulse based UWB system, a spectrum-efficient frequency hopping (FH) technique is proposed to increase average transmission power without violating the spectrum mask. An energy detection receiver is used to convert a frequency hopping signal to a baseband signal with the original bandwidth, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. A 500 Mb/s 7.25-9.5 GHz UWB transceiver is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. Having eight sub-bands with 50% overlap, the transceiver exhibits a meter-range communication capability with a 9 dB link margin enhancement. The transceiver consumes 13.3 mW from a 1 V supply, achieving an energy efficiency of 26.6 pJ/bit.},

abstract={Mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) thermography is an emerging technology with promising applications such as industrial monitoring, medicine and automotive, but its use in high-speed cameras is not yet widespread due to the lack of inexpensive sensor integration solutions and their common reliance on bulky cooling mechanisms. This work fills the gap by presenting a monolithic uncooled high-speed imager based on vapor-phase deposition lead selenide (VPD PbSe) photoconductors and a fully digital and configurable CMOS read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) to operate the MWIR imager. This ROIC features cancellation of PbSe dark current, compensation of its output capacitance and correction of the fixed pattern noise (FPN) caused by process non-uniformities in CMOS fabrication and detector deposition. The low-cost 80 × 80 imager has been integrated using 0.35 μm 2P4M standard CMOS technology and PbSe detector post-processing with 135 μm pixel pitch and 68% fill factor values. Experimental opto-electrical performance exhibits 10 bit real-time FPN compensation and DR calibration over the entire focal plane operating at 2 kfps, sub-0.5 LSB inter-pixel crosstalk, sub-μW pixel power consumption, and an overall figure of merit of 55 mK × ms.},

This is roughly a factor 2 lower than benchmark mass-produced designs.

abstract={In this paper, a fully-differential high-order switched-capacitor (SC) sigma-delta (ΣΔ) interface in a standard 0.5 μm CMOS technology for a micromechanical capacitive accelerometer is presented. A 1 bit digital output is attained by the interface circuit based on a low-noise front-end and a back-end third-order SC ΣΔ modulator, avoiding the use of a separate high-resolution ΣΔ converter to digitize the analog feedback signal. In addition, a micromechanical capacitive sensor element with a high quality factor (high-Q) is used to achieve high-resolution. Furthermore, closed-loop operation and electrical compensation are employed for damping the high-Q to ensure the stability of the high-order system. The sensor consumes 23 mW of power from a single 7 V supply at a sampling clock of 250 kHz. Meanwhile, a sensitivity of 1.896 V/g is achieved with a noise floor of lower than 200 ng /√Hz in low-frequency. The sensor has a nonlinearity of 0.15% with an input range of ±1.2g. The bandwidth (BW) is 300 Hz and the bias instability is 18 μg.},

abstract={A mobile electrical impedance tomography (EIT) IC is proposed for early breast cancer detection personally at home. To assemble the entire system into a simple brassiere shape, EIT IC is integrated via a multi-layered fabric circuit board which includes 90 EIT electrodes and two reference electrodes for current stimulation and voltage sensing. The IC supports three operating modes; gain scanning, contact impedance monitoring, and EIT modes for the clear EIT image. A differential sinusoidal current stimulator (DSCS) is proposed for injection of low-distortion programmable current which has harmonics less than -59 dBc at a load impedance of 2 kΩ. To get high sensitivity, a 6-channel voltage sensing amplifier can adaptively control the gain up to a maximum of 60 dB, and has low input referred noise, 36 nV/ √Hz. The 2.5 × 5 mm chip is fabricated in a 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS process and consumes 53.4 mW on average. As a result, a sensitivity of 4.9 mΩ is achieved which enables the detection of a 5 mm cancer mass within an agar test phantom.},

abstract={This paper presents a practical way to achieve both wide signal bandwidth and high dynamic range in a continuous- time (CT) delta-sigma modulator. Quantization noise is suppressed aggressively by increasing the effective order of the noise transfer function based on a sturdy multi-stage noise-shaping (SMASH) architecture. The proposed CT SMASH architecture has a much wider signal bandwidth which was limited in the discrete-time (DT) SMASH architecture due to the inherent sampling frequency limitation of DT implementation. Furthermore, the proposed CT SMASH architecture provides better quantization noise suppression by more completely canceling the quantization noise from the 1st-loop. The CT SMASH architecture is implemented with several efficient circuit techniques suitable for high operation speed. As a result, the prototype fabricated in 28 nm CMOS achieves DR of 85 dB, peak SNDR of 74.9 dB, SFDR of 89.3 dBc, and Schreier FOM of 172.9 dB over a 50 MHz bandwidth at a 1.8 GHz sampling frequency.},

The gain cell employed in the TWA is designed to compensate the synthetic-line losses at high frequencies in order to extend the bandwidth as well as the gain bandwidth product (GBP). A gain of 10 dB and a 3 dB bandwidth of 170 GHz are measured for the fabricated circuit. The circuit analysis is presented to illustrate how the bandwidth of the circuit is dominated by the cutoff frequency of the synthetic lines, thus demonstrating complete losses compensation for the band of interest. The chip required a total area of 0.38 mm 2 and a power consumption of 108 mW. Compared against the state of the art, the presented design achieves the highest reported GBP per power consumption and area, as well as the highest operation frequency for silicon implementations.},

The 10 μm × 10 μm pixel incorporates a TOF detector that operates using the quantum efficiency modulation (QEM) technique at high modulation frequencies of up to 130 MHz, achieves a modulation contrast of 67% at 50 MHz and a responsivity of 0.14 A/W at 860 nm. The TOF sensor includes a 2 GS/s 10 bit signal path, which is used for the high ADC bandwidth requirements of the system that requires many ADC conversions per frame. The chip also comprises a clock generation circuit featuring a programmable phase and frequency clock generator with 312.5-ps phase step resolution derived from a 1.6 GHz oscillator. An integrated shutter engine and a programmable digital micro-sequencer allows an extremely flexible multi-gain/multi-shutter and multi-frequency/multi-phase operation. All chip data is transferred using two 4-lane MIPI D-PHY interfaces with a total of 8 Gb/s input/output bandwidth. The reported experimental results demonstrate a wide depth range of operation (0.8-4.2 m), small accuracy error ( 1%), very low depth uncertainty ( 0.5% of actual distance), and very high dynamic range ( >64 dB).},

abstract={A 3 MHz-to-1.8 GHz, 94 μW-to-9.5 mW, all-digital delay-locked loop (ADDLL) using 65-nm CMOS technology is presented. In this paper, a cyclic half-delay-line architecture that uses the same type of delay lines for cyclic delay determination and coarse locking is proposed and used to achieve the design goals of small footprint and fast locking for a large operating frequency range. In addition, a new delay structure is developed for the cyclic delay units and coarse delay line. In addition to clock gating, which is used to reduce power consumption in the lock-in state regardless of the clock frequency, the automatic bypassing of the cyclic operation is developed and used to reduce power consumption during high-frequency operation. Through the use of proposed techniques, the active area is reduced to only 0.0153 mm 2, and the operating frequency range is from 3 MHz to 1.8 GHz. The measurement results show that the proposed ADDLL achieves a peak-to-peak jitter of 3 ps with 9.5 mW power consumption when operated at 1.8 GHz.},

abstract={This paper presents an integrated hybrid 6-stage voltage multiplier without using high-voltage-tolerant devices. The proposed architecture obtains a good area and efficiency performance by cascading the Dickson charge pumps and the symmetrical Cockcroft-Walton charge pumps, and paralleling them with the proposed auxiliary charge pumps formed by parasitics. Implemented in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process, the prototype provides a wide output range of 3-6 V and 30-240 μA load from a 1 V supply with an efficiency of 48-58% (52% at the 6 V output when the gain is six). By using on-chip MOS capacitors as the flying capacitors, an area reduction of 66% as compared to the Dickson charge-pump of similar performance is achieved. The area shrinks to 0.05 mm 2 per 9× interleaved cell. The entailed efficiency loss due to parasitics is compensated by the proposed auxiliary parasitic pumping paths feeding forward to redirect the parasitic charge flow. With this technique, the efficiency enhances extra 11%. The technique is applicable to other on-chip charge-pumps.},

title={A Low-Power Dual-Frequency SIMO Buck Converter Topology With Fully-Integrated Outputs and Fast Dynamic Operation in 45 nm CMOS}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2161-2173}, 
abstract={The dual-frequency single-inductor multiple-output (DF-SIMO) buck converter topology is proposed. Unlike conventional single-frequency SIMO topologies, the DF-SIMO decouples the rate of power conversion at the input stage from the rate of power distribution at the output stage. Switching the input stage at low frequency ( ~ 2 MHz) simplifies its design in nanometer CMOS, especially with input voltages higher than 1.2 V, while switching the output stage at higher frequency enables faster output dynamic response, better cross-regulation, and smaller output capacitors without the efficiency and design complexity penalty of switching both the input and output stages at high frequency. Moreover, for output switching frequency higher than 100 MHz, the output capacitors can be small enough to be integrated on-chip. A low-power 5-output 2 MHz/120 MHz design in 45 nm with 1.8 V input targeting low-power microcontrollers is presented as an application. The outputs vary from 0.6 V to 1.6 V, with 4 outputs providing up to 15 mA and one output providing up to 50 mA. The design uses single 10 μH off-chip inductor, 2 nF on-chip capacitor for each 15 mA output and 4.5 nF for the 50 mA output. The peak efficiency is 73%, dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is 0.6 V/80 ns, and settling time is 30 ns for half-to-full load steps with no observable overshoot/undershoot or cross-regulation transients.},

abstract={A high-speed, track-and-hold amplifier and interleaved CMOS sample-and-hold circuit are implemented in an InP-on-CMOS fabrication process. Conventional 50- Ω interchip interconnects between III-V and CMOS circuits are eliminated with heterogeneous integration of III-V on CMOS, yielding higher performance circuits at lower power consumption. The track-and-hold amplifier is based on a double-switching feedback architecture using 250 nm InP HBTs and achieves an IIP3 of 19 dBm at a sampling rate of 30 GS/s. To the author's knowledge, this is the first published result of a high-speed track-and-hold amplifier in an InP BiCMOS process and the first implementation of a feedback linearized track-and-hold at a sampling rate above 2 GS/s. Additionally, a novel HBT buffer with feedback is demonstrated to offer high linearity and low power for driving time-interleaved CMOS sample-and-hold circuits. A 90 nm time-interleaved CMOS sample-and-hold circuit is demonstrated to achieve better than -53 dBc HD3 at a sampling rate of 5 GS/s while consuming roughly 24 mW per channel.},

abstract={This paper presents a modified Dickson converter to achieve wide input range capacitive DC-DC converters. Several implementations are carefully studied and compared, which shows that the folding Dickson converter is the best choice, not only for its reduced dynamic losses, but also for its very regular structure and operation. Folding is achieved by merging the terminals of two or more flying capacitors, creating one equivalent flying capacitor. In this design, a four stage folding Dickson converter is implemented to achieve four different voltage conversion ratios. A Bootstrapped Gate Boost Converter (BGBC) is proposed which uses a bootstrapping technique to generate a floating rail for the flying switches, whose terminal voltages vary by large amounts depending on input voltage and VCR. The inherent operation of the Dickson topology is used by copying the voltage of the flying capacitors on a grounded capacitor in one phase, which can then be used to generate a floating 1.2 V in the second phase. The converter has been implemented in a 90 nm technology, achieving a maximum output power of 50 mW, peak efficiency of 76.6% in the 2:1 conversion mode, and an average efficiency above 60% over the entire Vin and Pout range.},

Three reconfigurable step-up conversion ratios (5/2, 2/1, 3/2) have been implemented which can provide a wide range of output voltage from 1.2 V to 2.4 V with a nominal input voltage of 1 V. We propose a topology for the 5/2 mode which improves the efficiency by reducing the bottom-plate parasitic loss compared to a conventional series-parallel topology, while delivering the same amount of output power. Further, the proposed topology benefits from using core 1 V devices for all charge-transfer switches without incurring any voltage overstress. The converter can deliver load current in the range of 10 μA to 500 μA, achieving a peak efficiency of 88%, using only on-chip MOS and MOM capacitors for a high density implementation.},

pages={1372-1381}, 
abstract={This paper presents a SAR ADC with 71 dB SNDR and 85 dB SFDR at 50 MS/s while keeping low power consumption of 4.2 mW. To achieve high resolution without large increase of power, several SNR and SFDR enhancement techniques are proposed. Firstly, the ADC repeats comparison of LSB by using redundant DAC to average comparator noise and improve SNR. The technique also corrects settling error adaptively, which extends operation speed to 50 MHz even though extra comparison period is added for averaging. Secondly, simple filtering method for reducing DAC noise is introduced to achieve further improvement of SNR. Finally, new dithering method is proposed to enhance SFDR. Injecting noise-shaped, multi-valued and uniform-distributed dither to input of the ADC, spurs caused by capacitance mismatches of DAC can be suppressed more effectively compared with conventional dithering. These techniques can be realized by simple circuits in addition to a basic SAR ADC configuration and do not need high power consumption. The chip is fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process and occupies 0.1 mm 2 including all correction logic. The ADC achieved a peak figure of merit (FoM) of 168.7 dB.},

Modulation at one-third the RF frequency reduces the transmitter power consumption and enables channel selection using an integer-N PLL running at 800 MHz. The modulation technique does not require phase calibration and resolves the problems of traditional injection lock based modulators. The prototype transmitter consumes 2.4 mW while delivering -10 dBm RF power at the TX output resulting in an energy efficiency of 2.5 nJ/bit at 1.2 Mbps raw data rate. The measured RMS EVM for π/4 DQPSK modulation is 3.21%.},

abstract={System-on-a-chip (SoC) applications require multiple power supply voltages with the features of low noise for analog circuits and high efficiency for digital circuits. Thus, this paper proposes the priority-scheduled program (PSP) for the single-inductor quad-output (SIQO) switching converter. This technique manages energy delivery to multiple outputs, facilitates fast transient response, and reduces cross-regulation simultaneously. Moreover, a level bypass detector (LBD) is used to overcome the limitation of significant loading differences among quad outputs in conventional designs because the PSP technique cantransfer additional energy to low-priority outputs to avoid overshoot voltage at high-priority outputs. Furthermore, voltage disturbance can be filtered out using two additional low-dropout regulators that operate as buffers cascaded at two low-priority outputs. Therefore, the SIQO converter that is fabricated in 40 nm CMOS technology satisfies the power requirements in portable electronics given its low cross-regulation of 0.2%, fast transient response of 15 μs, and an output voltage ripple that is smaller than 30 mV.},

The Noff computing discussed in this paper is a control architecture for an MC-FPGA capable of performing fine-grained power gating on each programmable logic element (PLE) whose registers include a volatile register and also a nonvolatile shadow register for storing and loading data in the volatile register. The MC-FPGA performs fine-grained control of power supplied only to PLEs contributing to effective calculation, when context switching happens. With an MC-FPGA fabricated with a hybrid process of a 1.0 μm crystalline oxide semiconductor FET on a 0.5 μm CMOS FET, it has been confirmed that the proposed Noff computing can resume the previous task when a context switches back to it, increases PLE use efficiency, and reduces the power consumption by 27.7% at operating frequencies of 20 MHz with a driving voltage of 2.5 V.},

abstract={A dedicated ultra-low power fully integrated FSK wake-up receiver (WuRx) for wireless body area network (WBAN) is implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS technology with 0.7 V supply voltage. For low power consumption, a body channel communication (BCC) physical layer (PHY) is adopted with an 80 MHz carrier frequency. Moreover, an injection-locking digitally-controlled oscillator (IL-DCO) is used to provide an extraordinary gain and frequency-to-envelope conversion in the simple and power-efficient envelope detection receiver architecture. The IL-DCO plays an important role in amplifying and demodulating the received FSK signal under a tight power budget. Finally, for low system cost without any external components and calibration overhead, a successive approximation register (SAR) auto-calibration algorithm is proposed to promptly calibrate the frequency drift of the IL-DCO. As a result, the fabricated 1 mm 2 single-chip WuRX consumes 45 μW with a data rate of 312 kb/s, providing an 80 MHz reference frequency with 0.25% stability within 102 μs calibration time. The proposed WuRX delivers a stable reference clock to the main transceiver for crystal-less WBAN applications.},

pages={1237-1250}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a fully integrated direct power detector that monitors both RF current and RF voltage to detect the RF output power of the on-chip RF PA realized in a standard 40 nm CMOS process. The RF current measurement is realized by a sense winding in the output transformer, while the RF voltage waveform measurement is performed by capacitive division of the RF output voltage. Since the RF current and the RF voltage are both acquired, this power detector accurately and continuously determines the real output power of the RF PA with a maximum inaccuracy of ±0.5 dB over a wide 32.5 dB dynamic range. This power detector was integrated together with a 5 GHz RF PA designed for the WLAN IEEE 802.11ac communication standard. The power detector is capable of performing a RF output power measurement even for an antenna impedance mismatch up to voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) 2.8:1 with an accuracy of ±1 dB, which allows the power detector to be used in an automatic antenna-mismatch correction system to prevent performance degradation in the RF PA. Finally, since the proposed power detector can be completely incorporated inside the RF PA output transformer. It results in zero area overhead, proving a very cost effective design.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2572-2590}, 
abstract={A fully-integrated reconfigurable dual-band (760-960 MHz and 2.4-2.5 GHz) transceiver (TRX) for short range wireless communications is presented. The TRX consists of two individually-optimized RF front-ends for each band and one shared power-scalable analog baseband. The sub-GHz receiver has achieved the maximum 75 dBc 3rd-order harmonic rejection ratio (HRR3) by inserting a Q-enhanced notch filtering RF amplifier (RFA). In 2.4 GHz band, a single-ended-to-differential RFA with gain/phase imbalance compensation is proposed in the receiver. A ΣΔ fractional-N PLL frequency synthesizer with two switchable Class-C VCOs is employed to provide the LOs. Moreover, the integrated multi-mode PAs achieve the output P1dB (OP1dB) of 16.3 dBm and 14.1 dBm with both 25% PAE for sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz bands, respectively. A power-control loop is proposed to detect the input signal PAPR in real-time and flexibly reconfigure the PA's operation modes to enhance the back-off efficiency. With this proposed technique, the PAE of the sub-GHz PA is improved by ×3.24 and ×1.41 at 9 dB and 3 dB back-off powers, respectively, and the PAE of the 2.4 GHz PA is improved by ×2.17 at 6 dB back-off power. The presented transceiver has achieved comparable or even better performance in terms of noise figure, HRR, OP1dB and power efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={This paper reports a source follower-based active RC filter topology for RF front-ends in wideband systems.

Applying the proposed scheme to the conventional Sallen-Key filter also improves the stopband rejection performance. Furthermore, the proposed filter topology ultimately suppresses the DC offset voltage and flicker noise of the unity gain buffer, which is the only active circuit in the filter. The proposed biquad filter is implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS and the measurements exhibit >26 dBm IIP3, +12 dBm input P1dB, and 15 dB noise figure over 50-450 MHz of a 6 bit tunable frequency range.

The LBP of a given pixel is a binary vector, encoding the direction and sign of image contrast with respect to its neighbors. Each LBP provides a visual description of an image's local structure that is widely used for texture and object recognition. In the sensor proposed here, each pixel detects its corresponding LBP with respect to its four neighboring pixels and saves this information into a digital map using 6 bits to encode each pixel. The operation is executed during the exposure time and requires 83 pW/pixel · frame to be computed. The chip is implemented in a 0.35 μm CMOS featuring 34 T square pixels with 26 μm pitch.

abstract={This paper presents an inductor-less frequency selective input match wireless receiver front-end utilizing noise cancellation, operational from 0.7 to 3.8 GHz. The main path of the receiver consists of a high input impedance transconductance stage where the output is down-converted to baseband by current mode passive mixers, and then amplified to voltage by a transimpedance amplifier. The output voltage is converted into a current and frequency up-converted by a second set of transconductance stage and mixer. This current is then fed back to the input of the main path, reducing the input impedance, providing input match by means of negative feedback. An auxiliary path with digitally controllable gain is also introduced to cancel the noise of the main path while maintaining high linearity. The chip prototype is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and occupies an active area of 0.15 mm 2. It achieves a noise figure between 1.6 dB and 3.2 dB depending on the frequency of operation, and an out-of-band IIP2 and IIP3 better than +75 dBm and +1 dBm, respectively.

abstract={In this work, we present a true 3D 128 Gb 2 bit/cell vertical-NAND (V-NAND) Flash product for the first time. The use of barrier-engineered materials and gate all-around structure in the 3D V-NAND cell exhibits advantages over 1 × nm planar NAND, such as small Vth shift due to small cell coupling and narrow natural Vth distribution. Also, a negative counter-pulse scheme realizes a tightly programmed cell distribution. In order to reduce the effect of a large WL coupling, a glitch-canceling discharge scheme and a pre-offset control scheme is implemented. Furthermore, an external high-voltage supply scheme along with the proper protection scheme for a high-voltage failure is used to achieve low power consumption. The chip accomplishes 50 MB/s write throughput with 3 K endurance for typical embedded applications. Also, extended endurance of 35 K is achieved with 36 MB/s of write throughput for data center and enterprise SSD applications.},

pages={2814-2824}, 
abstract={A high switching frequency multi-phase buck converter architecture using a time-based compensator is presented. Efficiency degradation due to mismatch between the phases is mitigated by generating precisely matched duty-cycles by combining a time-based multi-phase generator (MPG) with a time-based PID compensator (T-PID). The proposed approach obviates the need for a complex current sensing and calibration circuitry needed to implement active current sharing in an analog controller. It also eliminates the need for a high resolution analog-to-digital converter and digital pulse width modulator needed for implementing passive current sharing in a digital controller. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype multi-phase buck converter occupies an active area of 0.32 mm2, of which the controller occupies only 0.04 mm2. The converter operates over a wide range of switching frequencies (30-70 MHz) and regulates output to any desired voltage in the range of 0.6 V to 1.5 V from 1.8 V input voltage. With a 400 mA step in the load current, the settling time is less than 0.6 μs and the measured duty-cycle mismatch is less than 0.48%. Better than 87% peak efficiency is achieved while consuming a quiescent current of only 3 μA/MHz.},

pages={2149-2160}, 
abstract={A dynamic vision sensor (DVS) encodes temporal contrast (TC) of light intensity into address-events that are asynchronously transmitted for subsequent processing. This paper describes a DVS with improved TC sensitivity and event encoding. To enhance the TC sensitivity, each pixel employs a common-gate photoreceptor for low output noise and a capacitively-coupled programmable gain amplifier for continuous-time signal amplification without sacrificing the intra-scene dynamic range. A proposed in-pixel asynchronous delta modulator (ADM) better preserves signal integrity in event encoding compared with self-timed reset (STR) used in previous DVSs. A 60 × 30 prototype sensor array with a 31.2 μm pixel pitch was fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 μm CMOS technology. It consumes 720 μW at a 100k event/s output rate. Measurements show that a 1% TC sensitivity with a 35% relative standard deviation is achieved and that the in-pixel ADM is up to 3.5 times less susceptible to signal loss than STR in terms of event number. These improvements can facilitate the application of DVSs in areas like optical neuroimaging which is demonstrated in a simulated experiment.},

pages={3015-3031}, 
abstract={A fully integrated technique for wideband cancellation of transmitter (TX) self-interference (SI) in the RF domain is proposed for multiband frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and full-duplex (FD) wireless applications. Integrated wideband SI cancellation (SIC) in the RF domain is accomplished through: 1) a bank of tunable, reconfigurable second-order high-Q RF bandpass filters in the canceller that emulate the antenna interface's isolation (essentially frequency-domain equalization in the RF domain) and 2) a linear N-path Gm-C filter implementation with embedded variable attenuation and phase shifting. A 0.8-1.4 GHz receiver (RX) with the proposed wideband SIC circuits is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. In measurement, >20 MHz 20 dB cancellation bandwidth (BW) is achieved across frequency-selective antenna interfaces: 1) a custom-designed LTElike 0.780/0.895 GHz duplexer with TX/RX isolation peak magnitude of 30 dB, peak group delay of 11 ns, and 7 dB magnitude variation across the TX band for FDD and 2) a 1.4 GHz antenna pair for FD wireless with TX/RX isolation peak magnitude of 32 dB, peak group delay of 9 ns, and 3 dB magnitude variation over 1.36-1.38 GHz. For FDD, SIC enhances the effective outof-band (OOB) IIP3 and IIP2 to +25-27 dBm and +90 dBm, respectively (enhancements of 8-10 and 29 dB, respectively). For FD, SIC eliminates RX gain compression for as high as -8 dBm of peak in-band (IB) SI, and enhances effective IB IIP3 and IIP2 by 22 and 58 dB.},

abstract={Silicon-photonics is an emerging technology that can overcome the tradeoffs faced by traditional electrical I/O. Due to ballooning development costs for advanced CMOS nodes, however, widespread adoption necessitates seamless photonics integration into mainstream processes, with as few process changes as possible. In this work, we demonstrate a silicon-photonic link with optical devices and electronics integrated on the same chip in a 0.18 μm bulk CMOS memory periphery process. To enable waveguides and optics in process-native polysilicon, we introduce deep-trench isolation, placed underneath to prevent optical mode leakage into the bulk silicon substrate, and implant-amorphization to reduce polysilicon loss. A resonant defect-trap photodetector using polysilicon eliminates need for germanium integration and completes the fully polysilicon-based photonics platform. Transceiver circuits take advantage of photonic device integration, achieving 350 fJ/b transmit and 71 μApp BER = 10-12 receiver sensitivity at 5 Gb/s. We show high fabrication uniformity and high-Q resonators, enabling dense wavelength-division multiplexing with 9-wavelength 45 Gb/s transmit/receive data-rates per waveguide/fiber. To combat perturbations to variation- and thermally-sensitive resonant devices, we demonstrate an on-chip thermal tuning feedback loop that locks the resonance to the laser wavelength. A 5 m optical chip-to-chip link achieves 5 Gb/s while consuming 3 pJ/b and 12 pJ/bit of circuit and optical energy, respectively.},

abstract={A complementary p-n class-B oscillator with two magnetically coupled second harmonic tail resonators is presented and compared to an N-only reference one. An in depth analysis of phase noise, based on direct derivation of the Impulse Sensitivity Function (ISF), provides design insights on the optimization of the tail resonators. In principle the complementary p-n oscillator has the same optimum Figure of Merit (FoM) of the N-only at half the voltage swing. At a supply voltage of 1.5 V, the maximum allowed oscillation amplitude of the N-only is constrained, by reliability considerations, to be smaller than the value that corresponds to the optimum FoM even when 1.8 V thick oxide transistors are used. For an oscillation amplitude that ensures reliable operation and the same tank, the p-n oscillator achieves a FoM 2 to 3 dB better than the N, only depending on the safety margin taken in the design. After frequency division by 2, the p-n oscillator has a measured phase noise that ranges from -150.8 to -151.5 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset from the carrier when the frequency of oscillation is varied from 7.35 to 8.4 GHz.

abstract={Pushed by the availability of large fractional bandwidths, many well-established applications are focusing mm-wave spectrum for product deployment. Generation of broadband power at mm-waves is challenging because a key target such as the efficiency trades with the gain-bandwidth (GBW) product. The major limit is the capacitive parasitics at the interstage between driver and power devices. The latter are designed with a large form factor so as to deliver the desired output power and are commonly biased in class-AB to achieve high drain efficiency, penalizing GBW. In this paper, a design methodology for interstage and output matching networks targeting large fractional bandwidth and high efficiency is proposed. Leveraging inductively coupled resonators, we apply Norton transformations for impedance scaling. In both networks, topological transformations are employed to include a transformer, achieve the desired load impedance and minimize the number of components. A two-stage differential PA with neutralized common source stages has been realized in 28 nm CMOS using low-power devices. The PA delivers 13 dBm saturated output power over the 40-67 GHz bandwidth with a peak power-added efficiency of 16% without power combining. To the best of author's knowledge, the presented PA shows state-of-the-art performances with the largest fractional bandwidth among bulk CMOS mm-wave PAs reported so far.},

abstract={A full-rate burst-mode receiver that achieves fast on/off operation needed for energy-proportional links is presented. By injecting input data edges into the oscillator embedded in a classical Type-II digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, the proposed receiver achieves instantaneous phase-locking and input jitter filtering simultaneously. In other words, the proposed CDR combines the advantages of conventional feed-forward and feedback architectures to achieve energy-proportional operation. By controlling the number of data edges injected into the oscillator, both the jitter transfer bandwidth and the jitter tolerance corner are accurately controlled. The feedback loop also corrects for any frequency error and helps improve CDR's immunity to oscillator frequency drift during the power-on and -off states. This also improves CDR's tolerance to consecutive identical digits present in the input data. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype receiver instantaneously locks onto the very first data edge and consumes 6.1 mW at 2.2 Gb/s. Owing to its short power-on time, the receiver's energy efficiency varies only from 2.77 pJ/bit to 3.87 pJ/bit when the effective data rate is varied from 0.44 Gb/s to 2.2 Gb/s. Input sensitivity of the receiver is 36 mV for a BER of 10-12.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully-integrated 3D image radar engine utilizing beamforming for electrical scanning and precise ranging technique for distance measurement. Four transmitters and four receivers form a sensor frontend with phase shifters and power combiners adjusting the beam direction. A built-in 31.3 GHz clock source and a frequency tripler provide both RF carrier and counting clocks for the distance measurement.

abstract={A frequency-agile FM-UWB transceiver (Tx/Rx) with full on-chip calibration aimed at low data rate autonomous wireless sensing applications is described. The subcarrier VCO, 3-phase CCO, and frequency-tripling PA in the transmit path produce a wideband, double-FM output at -10.1 dBm-pk (FCC compliant). A tunable LNA, envelope detector, limiter, and FSK demodulator comprise the receiver. Digitally programmable matching networks at the PA output and LNA input facilitate independent tuning of Tx and Rx across the 3-5 GHz band. An on-chip SAR-FLL controlling 5 DACs (3 I-DACs and 2 C-DACs) performs a full Tx/Rx calibration in less than 2 ms. Designed for continuous operation at 100 kb/s, measured Rx sensitivity is -80.5 dBm (10 -3 BER), and average Tx/Rx energy efficiency is 6 nJ/bit. Total dissipation for the 0.9 mm 2 IC implemented in 90 nm RF-CMOS is 630 μW in Tx and 580 μW in Rx mode from a 1 V supply.},

abstract={Approximate nearest neighbor searching has been studied as the keypoint matching algorithm for object recognition systems, and its hardware realization has reduced the external memory access which is the main bottleneck in object recognition process. However, external memory access reduction alone cannot satisfy the ever-increasing memory bandwidth requirement due to the rapid increase of the image resolution and frame rate of many recent applications such as advanced driver assistance system. In this paper, vocabulary forest (VF) processor is proposed that achieves both high accuracy and high speed by integrating on-chip database (DB) to remove external memory access. The area-efficient reusable-vocabulary tree architecture is proposed to reduce area, and the propagate-and-compute-array architecture is proposed to enhance the processing speed of the VF. The proposed VF processor can speed up the object matching stage by 16.4x compared with the state-of-the-art matching processor [Hong et al., Symp. VLSIC, 2013] for high resolution (Full-HD) and real-time (60 fps) video object recognition. It is fabricated using 65 nm CMOS technology and integrated into an object recognition SoC. The proposed VF chip achieves 2.07 M-vector/s throughput and 13.3 nJ/vector per-vector energy with 95.7% matching accuracy for 100 objects.},

volume={50},

pages={1324-1331}, 
abstract={This paper presents highly reliable reference bitline bias designs for 64 Mb and 128 Mb chain FeRAM™. The hysteresis shape deformation of ferroelectric capacitor due to temperature variation causes cell signal level shifts of both “1” and “0” data. The reference bitline bias of 64 Mb chip is designed to keep intermediate value of “1” and “0” data at any operating temperatures from -40°C to 85 °C by introducing a modified band-gap reference circuit with 3 bit temperature coefficient trimmers and 6 bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) using laser fuses. The measured result shows the improvement of tail-to-tail cell signal windows by ±22 mV. Moreover, a new reference bias circuit called the “elevator circuit” with 3 bit temperature coefficient trimmers using ferroelectric fuses installed in a 128 Mb chip compensates array operating voltage VAA fluctuation as well as temperature variation. The elevator circuit enables the temperature dependency control at low external VDD of 1.8 V. This improves cell signal window by ±40 mV. The elevator circuit also varies reference bitline bias with array operating voltage VAA variation, resulting in improvement of cell signal windows by ±44 mV in the range of 1.5 V ±0.2 V VAA.},

title={A 26 W 97%-Efficiency Fast-Settling Dimmable LED Driver With Dual-nMOS-Sensing Based Glitch-Tolerant Synchronous Current Control for High-Brightness Solid-State Lighting Applications},

volume={50},

pages={2174-2187}, 
abstract={This paper presents an integrated buck-type dimmable synchronous LED driver for high-brightness solid-state lighting applications. A glitch-tolerant synchronous current control (GT-SCC) scheme is proposed to regulate the average LED current. The GT-SCC enables fast settling time of the LED current upon start-up or PWM dimming condition, and provides reliable operation under high dV/dt slewing during switching transitions of the LED driver. The proposed LED driver consists of a high-speed low-power HV synchronous gate driver to enable on-chip synchronous rectification with a dual-nMOS power train under different input voltages for the conduction power loss reduction. Two on-chip senseFET peak and valley current sensors are also developed to offer low-power and reliable current sensing under high input voltages. Implemented in a 0.35 μm 50 V CMOS process, the proposed LED driver supports a wide input range from 5 V to 45 V, operates up to 4 MHz with a small-value inductor of 8.2 μH, handles a high PWM dimming frequency of 20 kHz with a wide duty-ratio range from 0.1 to 1, and delivers an average LED current of 700 mA for driving up to 12 series-connected HB-LEDs (with the maximum output power of 26 W). The proposed LED driver achieves a peak power efficiency of 97.2% and the current deviation ≤ ±3.3% of the average LED current under different conditions. The worst-case settling time achieves 3.2 μs that is at least 2.7 times improvement over state-of-the-art counterparts.},

abstract={The virtual ground reference buffer (VGRB) technique is introduced as a means to improve the performance of switched-capacitor circuits. The technique enhances the performance by improving the feedback factor of the op-amp without affecting the signal gain. The bootstrapping action of the level-shifting buffers relaxes key op-amp performance requirements including unity-gain bandwidth, noise, open-loop gain and offset compared with conventional circuits. This reduces the design complexity and the power consumption of op-amp based circuits. Based on this technique, a 12 b pipelined ADC is implemented in 65 nm CMOS that achieves 67.0 dB SNDR at 250 MS/s and consumes 49.7 mW of power from a 1.2 V power supply.},

abstract={In a smart temperature sensor system, two individual building blocks, a sensing front-end and an analog-to-digital converter, are cascaded to implement the temperature-to-digital conversion. In this work, a thermistor-embedded continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM), which merges these two building blocks into one, is proposed for a hardware- and energy-efficient temperature acquisition. The thermistor-based sensing front-end is reused in a 2nd-order 1 bit CTDSM to attain a high-resolution, low hardware complexity, and energy-efficient temperature sensing. Furthermore, a resistor-ladder with a switch on-resistance compensation scheme is proposed to implement the trimming circuit. Over a range of -45°C ~ 125°C, the proposed smart temperature sensor consumes 64.5 μW from 1.5 V supply voltage and achieves a resolution around 0.01°C rms (1 σ) temperature resolution with a single conversion time of 100 μs. The corresponding resolution FoM is 0.65 pJ°C2. With 1-point trimming, this design achieves ±1°C temperature inaccuracy; this inaccuracy can be further improved to ±0.4°C with additional batch calibration.},

title={Layer-Aware Program-and-Read Schemes for 3D Stackable Vertical-Gate BE-SONOS NAND Flash Against Cross-Layer Process Variations}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1491-1501}, 
abstract={3D vertical-gate (3DVG) NAND flash is a promising candidate for next-generation high-density nonvolatile memory. Cross-layer process variation renders 3DVG NAND susceptible to decreased speeds, yield, and reliability. This can be attributed to (a) cross-layer mismatch in bitline capacitance (CBL), (b) the need for long program cycles, and (c) sensing-margin (SM) loss induced by the effects of background-pattern-dependency (BPD). This study proposes three circuit-level techniques to overcome these issues by employing the following: (1) distributed NAND-string scramble (DNSS), (2) layer-aware program-verify-and-read (LA-PV-R), and (3) a layer-aware-bitline-precharge (LA-BP) scheme. For an 8-layer 3DVG with 200 mV cross-layer mismatch in cell threshold voltage ( V THC), DNSS reduces the cross-layer C BL-mismatch by 41%, LA-PV-R using various program-threshold-voltages ( V THP) for each layer enables a 25% reduction in the number of program cycles, and LA-BP succeeds in reducing BPD-induced SM loss by 56%. A 2-layer 3DVG NAND testchip and 8-layer testkey were fabricated to evaluate the proposed methods. The LA-PV-R and LA-BP have achieved a 0.75 V difference in V THP between layer-0 and layer-1 with a 0.4V difference in BL clamping bias voltages and the LA-BP scheme has achieved a 44% reduction in BPD-induced SM loss. The three proposed schemes incur an area penalty of less than 0.1% in a Gb-scale 3DVG NAND device.},

abstract={This paper presents a 13 bit 50 MS/s fully differential ring amplifier based SAR-assisted pipeline ADC, implemented in 65 nm CMOS. We introduce a new fully differential ring amplifier, which solves the problems of single-ended ring amplifiers while maintaining the benefits of high gain, fast slew based charging and an almost rail-to-rail output swing. We implement a switched-capacitor (SC) inter-stage residue amplifier that uses this new fully differential ring amplifier to give accurate amplification without calibration. In addition, a new floated detect-and-skip (FDAS) capacitive DAC (CDAC) switching method reduces the switching energy and improves linearity of first-stage CDAC. With these techniques, the prototype ADC achieves measured SNDR, SNR, and SFDR of 70.9 dB (11.5b), 71.3 dB and 84.6 dB, respectively, with a Nyquist frequency input. The prototype achieves 13 bit linearity without calibration and consumes 1 mW. This measured performance is equivalent to Walden and Schreier FoMs of 6.9 fJ/conversion ·step and 174.9 dB, respectively.},

Transmit equalization consists of a 2-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) while receive equalization includes a 2-tap FFE using a transversal filter, a 3-stage continuous-time linear equalizer with active feedback, and discrete-time equalizers consisting of a 17-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a 3-tap sampled FFE. The receiver uses quarter-rate double integrate-and-hold sampling. The clock and data recovery (CDR) unit uses a split-path CDR/DFE design which facilitates wider bandwidth and lower jitter simultaneously. A phase detection scheme that filters out edges affected by residual inter-symbol interference allows recovering a low-jitter clock from a partially-equalized eye. A fractional-N PLL is implemented for frequency offset tracking. Combining these techniques, the digital CDR recovers a stable 10 GHz clock from an eye containing 0.8 UI p-p input jitter and achieves 1-10 MHz of tracking bandwidth. The transceiver achieves horizontal and vertical eye openings of 0.27 UI and 120 mV, respectively, at BER = 10-9. The quad SerDes is realized in 28 nm CMOS technology. Amortizing common blocks, it occupies 0.81 mm2 per lane and achieves 23.2 mW/Gb/s power efficiency at 40 Gb/s.},

abstract={This paper presents a multicarrier 60 GHz transmitter for distance measurement (ranging) in an indoor wireless localization system, achieving mm-precision with high update rate. The architecture comprises a baseband subcarrier generator, an upconverter, and a power amplifier. There are three key innovations, all stemming from careful hardware-algorithm co-design: 1) efficient frequency planning of the 6 GHz-wide band; 2) power-efficient multicarrier signal generation by means of digital frequency divisions exploiting the phase-based time-of-arrival ranging algorithm; and 3) PAPR reduction to enable efficient operation of the power amplifier. By implementing these key techniques, 0.7-2.7 mm precision is achieved over 5 m measured distance with 5.4 μs symbol duration. During operation, the core digital subcarrier generator generates 16 non-equidistant subcarriers from a 3 GHz input clock, while consuming an average power of 1.8 mW out of 0.9V supply. The upconverter and the power amplifier altogether consume around 127 mW. The total area of the transmitter is 1.1 mm2. The chip is fabricated in a 40nm general purpose CMOS process.},

abstract={A power-efficient wireless switched-capacitor based stimulating (SCS) system for electrical/optical deep brain stimulation (DBS) is presented. The SCS system efficiently charges storage capacitors directly from an inductive link and delivers accurately balanced charge to the tissue, improving the overall stimulator efficiency. In addition, the decaying exponential stimulus pulses generated by SCS can be more effective than conventional rectangular and ramp stimuli in activating neural tissue when consuming the same amount of energy, leading to higher stimulus efficacy. A 4-channel wireless SCS system in 0.35 μm CMOS process achieves stimulator efficiency of 80.4% with capacitor pairs charged to ±2V, while the decaying exponential stimulus requires equal or less stimulus energy and injected charge than other stimuli depending on pulse width to activate the same tissue area. The SCS system has also been utilized for power-efficient wireless optogenetic stimulation by periodically discharging capacitors into high-current micro-LED arrays. Results from acute in vivo experiments have verified the utility of the SCS system prototype in both electrical and optical stimulation.},

title={A Multi-Granularity FPGA With Hierarchical Interconnects for Efficient and Flexible Mobile Computing}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={1}, 
pages={137-149}, 
abstract={Following the rapid expansion of mobile computing, mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have off-loaded most compute-intensive tasks to dedicated accelerators to improve energy and area efficiency. An increasing number of accelerators in power-limited SoCs results in large regions of “dark silicon.” Unlike processors, dedicated hardware is inflexible, so any changes would require a chip re-design, which significantly impacts cost and timeline. To address the need for efficiency and flexibility, this work presents a multi-granularity FPGA suitable for mobile computing. Occupying 20.5 mm 2 in 40 nm CMOS, the chip incorporates fine-grained configurable logic blocks, medium-grained DSP processors and reconfigurable block RAMs, and two coarse-grained kernels: a 64- to 8192-point FFT processor and a 16-core universal DSP for software-defined radios. Using a mix-radix hierarchical interconnect, the chip achieves a 3-4× interconnect area reduction over commercial FPGAs for comparable connectivity, reducing overall area and leakage by 2-2.5×, and delivering up to 50% lower active power. With coarse-grained kernels, the energy efficiency reaches within 4-5× of ASIC designs.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1424-1437}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully-integrated μW-level photovoltaic (PV) self-sustaining energy harvesting system proposed for smart nodes of Internet of Things (IOT) networks. A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the PV harvesting system achieved both ultra-low power operation capability at 12 μW and a peak self-sustaining efficiency of 86%.},

pages={1571-1580}, 
abstract={This paper describes the design of a temperature sensor based on integrated poly-silicon thermistors. The thermistors are incorporated in a Wien-bridge RC filter, which, in turn, is embedded in a frequency-locked loop. The loop's output frequency is then determined by the filter's temperature-dependent phase shift, thus realizing an energy-efficient and high resolution temperature sensor. After a 3-point calibration, the sensor achieves an inaccuracy of less than ±0.12°C (min-max) from -40°C to 85°C. This translates into a frequency stability of better than ±2 ppm from -40°C to 85°C when the sensor is used to temperature compensate the quartz-crystal oscillator of a 32 kHz real-time clock. The 0.09 mm2 sensor also achieves 2.8 mK (rms) resolution in a 32 ms conversion time while dissipating only 31 μW.},

abstract={This paper describes a fractional-N subsampling PLL in 28 nm CMOS. Fractional phase lock is made possible with almost no penalty in phase noise performance thanks to the use of a 10 bit, 0.55 ps/LSB digital-to-time converter (DTC) circuit operating on the sampling clock. The performance limitations of a practical DTC implementation are considered, and techniques for minimizing these limitations are presented. For example, background calibration guarantees appropriate DTC gain, reducing spurs. Operating at 10 GHz the system achieves -38 dBc of integrated phase noise (280 fs RMS jitter) when a worst case fractional spur of -43 dBc is present. In-band phase noise is at the level of -104 dBc/Hz. The class-B VCO can be tuned from 9.2 GHz to 12.7 GHz (32%). The total power consumption of the synthesizer, including the VCO, is 13 mW from 0.9 V and 1.8 V supplies.},

abstract={A 12 bit 160 MS/s two-step pipelined SAR ADC was fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS low-leakage digital process. A background bit-weight calibration exploiting the comparator resolving time information and the employment of a sub-binary DAC in the first SAR stage are two key techniques in this work to attain high conversion throughput and power savings at the same time using a simple, low-gain (~30 dB) residue amplifier. The overall architecture and the digital calibration also enable the downsizing of the first SAR stage to that of the kT/C limit, yielding a wideband input network delivering an over 80 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) while digitizing a 300 MHz input at 160 MS/s. The core ADC consumes 4.96 mW and occupies an area of 0.042 mm2; the calibration circuits dissipate 0.1 mW (estimated). An 86.9 dB SFDR and a 66.7 dB signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) were measured with a 2 Vpp, 5 MHz sine-wave input at full speed.

pages={2922-2934}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 28 nm CMOS 10 b SHA-less pipelined/SAR hybrid ADC, designed to enable a direct-sampling receiver system. To achieve low power at 5 GS/s, the ADC combines pipelined and SAR quantizers, powered at 1.8 V and 1 V, respectively. A 2.5 b 2-way time-interleaved 2.5 GS/s multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) is followed by an 8 b 8-way time-interleaved 625 MHz successive-approximation register (SAR). This architecture combines the benefits of both ADC topologies and allows significant power and complexity reduction. The high-speed 2.5 b MDAC front-end simplifies the complexity of time-interleaving (TI) and provides gain for attenuating the 8 b SAR non-idealities, when referred to the ADC input, relaxing its specifications and design. To further reduce power, the 2.5 b MDAC front-end is SHA-less, and an over-range calibration loop that allows operation at multi-GHz input is introduced. A calibration technique is also proposed to align the MDAC and SAR references, whose misalignment would otherwise produce integral non-linearity (INL) degradation. The ADC achieves -61.8 dB THD, 57.1 dB SNR for a 500 MHz input, while for a 2.35 GHz input it achieves -54.7 dB THD, 46.8 dB SNR (55.8 dB SNR excluding the integrated PLL contribution). The time-interleaving spur is 70 dBc. The ADC consumes 150 mW and occupies less than 0.5 mm2.},

abstract={Dynamic Architecture and Frequency Scaling (DAFS) is shown to realize superlinear power scaling in high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To achieve both high-speed operation and low power consumption, the ADC architecture is reconfigured between binary search and flash every clock cycle, relying on the conversion delay. The proposed binary search/flash architecture reconfigurable ADC can be implemented with only a small modification to conventional binary search ADCs. By live configuring, the flash operation is adaptively performed when an excess delay is detected. DAFS not only significantly improves the power scaling but also compensates for transistor speed shifts due to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. Therefore, DAFS can be used to improve the design margin of high-speed ADCs. A prototype subranging ADC fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology operates up to 1220 MS/s and achieves an SNDR of 36.2 dB with a Nyquist input frequency. DAFS is active between 820-1220 MS/s and achieves peak power reduction of 30%, when compared with the power scaling when DAFS is disabled. A peak FoM of 85 fJ/conv. was obtained at 820 MS/s, which is nearly a twofold improvement over that of previously reported subranging ADCs.},

abstract={Real-time augmented reality (AR) is actively studied for the future user interface and experience in high-performance head-mounted display (HMD) systems. The small battery size and limited computing power of the current HMD, however, fail to implement the real-time markerless AR in the HMD. In this paper, we propose a real-time and low-power AR processor for advanced 3D-AR HMD applications. For the high throughput, the processor adopts task-level pipelined SIMD-PE clusters and a congestion-aware network-on-chip (NoC). Both of these two features exploit the high data-level parallelism (DLP) and task-level parallelism (TLP) with the pipelined multicore architecture. For the low power consumption, it employs a vocabulary forest accelerator and a mixed-mode support vector machine (SVM)-based DVFS control to reduce unnecessary external memory accesses and core activation. The proposed 4 mm × 8 mm HMD AR processor is fabricated using 65 nm CMOS technology for a battery-powered HMD platform with real-time AR operation. It consumes 381 mW average power and 778 mW peak power at 250 MHz operating frequency and 1.2 V supply voltage. It achieves 1.22 TOPS peak performance and 1.57 TOPS/W energy efficiency, which are, respectively, 3.58 × and 1.18 × higher than the state of the art.},

abstract={This paper describes the clock distribution and synchronization network for a 64 bit ARMv8 8-core microprocessor. Embedded in a SoC for cloud computing platforms, the processor is fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS technology and operates at 3.0 GHz. The system PLL has a measured rms jitter <;1 ps and features dynamic frequency hopping for DVFS applications. In conjunction with a Star/H/Mesh topology, the clock distribution uses both CML and CMOS circuits to minimize period jitter and nominally achieves <;0.8 ps/mV | rms and <;9 ps of period jitter and skew, respectively. By using local Duty Cycle Adjustment circuits in each core to properly offset the clock duty cycle and ease timing critical paths, the processor performance improves by more than 5%. A simple probing circuit for high speed clock measurements can be used to monitor the high frequency excursions of the internal supply to counteract any timing violation that could occur. Finally an enhanced latch, which improves MTBF by up to 5 orders of magnitude and thus is suited for high speed synchronization operations, is proposed.},

year={2015},

pages={1764-1771}, 
abstract={It is traditionally challenging to implement higher-order PWM closed-loop Class-D audio amplifiers using analog intensive techniques in deep-submicron, low voltage process technologies. This is primarily attributed to reduced power supply, degraded analog transistor characteristics, including short-channel effects, increased flicker noise, random telegraph noise, transistor reliability concerns and passive component performance. In this paper, we introduce a global closed-loop mixed-signal architecture incorporating digital control and integrate a fourth-order amplifier prototype in 55 nm CMOS. A systematic approach to analyze, design and compensate the feedback loop in the digital domain is also presented. The versatility of implementing the loop gain poles and zeros digitally attains high gain throughout the audio band and attenuates residual high frequency ripples around the loop, simultaneously accomplishing improvements in THD+N and PSRR. The overall architecture is inherently amenable to implementation in deep-submicron and is therefore compatible with scaled CMOS. The measured prototype achieves a high 105 dBA SNR, 0.0031% THD+N, 92 dB PSRR and 85% efficiency when supplying 1 W into emulated 8 Ω speaker load. This performance is competitive with conventional designs using large feature size precision CMOS or specialized BCD technologies and reports the highest output power (1.5 W) for deep-submicron designs.},

abstract={A 60 GHz sub-sampling PLL implemented in 40 nm CMOS is presented in this paper. The sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD) runs at 30 GHz after an inductively-peaked static divide-by-two. Thanks to the lower frequency of operation, the effect of non-zero sampling aperture of the switch is minimized. A dummy divider of the quadrature PLL is utilized for the sub-sampling loop to avoid extra loading in the 60 GHz path. A 53.8-63.3 GHz QVCO uses super-harmonic coupling at 120 GHz for relaxed headroom at a 0.9 V supply and achieves a free-running phase noise down to -94.5 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The millimeter-wave sub-sampling PLL achieves an RMS jitter, integrated from 1 kHz to 100 MHz, of 200 fs at a power consumption of 42 mW, compared to 210 fs for the PFD/CP PLL at 75 mW. Reference spurs in both modes are below -40 dBc.},

abstract={Adding vision capabilities to wireless sensors nodes (WSN) for the Internet-of-Things requires imagers working at ultra-low power (ULP) in nanometer CMOS systems-on-chip (SoCs). Such performance can be obtained with time-based digital pixel sensors (DPS) working at ultra-low voltage (ULV), at the expense of lower dynamic range, higher fixed-pattern noise (FPN) and thus poorer image quality. To address this problem, three key techniques were developed in this work for DPS pixels: wide-range adaptive body biasing, low-gating of the 2-transistor in-pixel comparator and digital readout performing delta-reset sampling with low switching activity and robust timing closure. These concepts were demonstrated by designing and fabricating a 128 × 128 CMOS image sensor array in a 65 nm low-power CMOS logic process. Operating at 0.5 V, it features an FPN of 0.66%, a dynamic range of 42 dB and a fill factor of 57% with a 4 μm pixel pitch, while consuming only 17 pJ/(frame.pixel) and 8.8 μW at 32 fps. These performances combined with the small silicon area of 0.69 mm2 makes the imager perfectly suitable for integration in ULP SoCs, targeting WSN applications.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose wire-free integrated sensors that monitor pulse wave velocity (PWV) and respiration, both non-electrical vital signs, by using an all-electrical method. The key techniques that we employ to obtain all-electrical and wire-free measurement are bio-impedance (BI) and analog-modulated body-channel communication (BCC), respectively. For PWV, time difference between ECG signal from the heart and BI signal from the wrist is measured. To remove wires and avoid sampling rate mismatch between ECG and BI sensors, ECG signal is sent to the BI sensor via analog BCC without any sampling. For respiration measurement, BI sensor is located at the abdomen to detect volume change during inhalation and exhalation. A prototype chip fabricated in 0.11 μm CMOS process consists of ECG, BI sensor and BCC transceiver. Measurement results show that heart rate and PWV are both within their normal physiological range.

title={A Fully Parallel Nonbinary LDPC Decoder With Fine-Grained Dynamic Clock Gating}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={2}, 
pages={464-475}, 
abstract={Nonbinary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes, defined over Galois field, offer better coding gain and a lower error floor than binary LDPC codes. However, the complex decoding and large memory requirement have prevented any practical chip implementations. We present a 1.22 Gb/s fully parallel decoder of a GF(64) (160, 80) regular-(2, 4) NB-LDPC code in 65 nm CMOS. The reduced number of edges in NB-LDPC code's factor graph permits a low wiring overhead in the fully parallel architecture. The throughput is further improved by a one-step look-ahead check node design that increases the clock frequency to 700 MHz, and the interleaving of variable node and check node operations that shortens one decoding iteration to 47 clock cycles. We allow each processing node to detect its own convergence and apply dynamic clock gating to save power. When all processing nodes have been clock gated, the decoder terminates and continues with the next input to increase the throughput to 1.22 Gb/s. The dynamic clock gating and decoder termination improve the energy efficiency to 3.03 nJ/b, or 259 pJ/b/iteration, at 1.0 V and 700 MHz. Voltage scaling to 675 mV improves the energy efficiency to 89 pJ/b/iteration for a throughput of 698 Mb/s at 400 MHz.},

volume={50},

pages={450-463}, 
abstract={This paper presents the first published fully-integrated digital fractional- N PLL based on a second-order frequency-to-digital converter (FDC) instead of a time-to-digital converter (TDC). The PLL's quantization noise is nearly identical to that of a conventional analog delta-sigma modulator based PLL (ΔΣ-PLL). Hence, the quantization noise is highpass shaped and is suppressed by the PLL's loop filter to the point where it is not a dominant contributor to the PLL's output phase noise. However, in contrast to a ΔΣ-PLL, the new PLL has an entirely digital loop filter and its analog components are relatively insensitive to non-ideal analog circuit behavior. Therefore, it offers the performance benefits of a ΔΣ-PLL and the area and scalability benefits of a TDC-based digital PLL. Additionally, the PLL's digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) incorporates a new switched-capacitor frequency control element that is insensitive to supply noise and parasitic coupling. The PLL is implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology, has an active area of 0.56 mm2, dissipates 21 mW from 1.0 and 1.2 V supplies, and its measured phase noise at 3.5 GHz is -123, -135, and -150 dBc/Hz at offsets of 1, 3, and 20 MHz, respectively. The PLL's power consumption is lower than previously published digital PLLs with comparable phase noise performance.},

abstract={An auto-zero and chopper operational amplifier with a 4.5-60 V supply voltage range is realized, using a 0.18 μm CMOS process augmented by 5 V CMOS and 60 V DMOS transistors. It achieves a maximum offset voltage drift of 0.02 μV/°C, a minimum CMRR of 145 dB, a noise PSD of 6.8 nV/√Hz, and a 3.1 MHz unity gain bandwidth, while dissipating 840 μA of current. Up-modulated chopper ripple is suppressed by auto- zeroing. Furthermore, glitches from the charge injection of the input switches are mitigated by employing six parallel input stages with 800 kHz interleaved clocks. This moves the majority of the glitch energy up to 4.8 MHz, while leaving little energy at 800 kHz. As a result, the requirements on an external low-pass glitch filter is relaxed, and a wider usable signal bandwidth can be obtained. Maximum input bias current due to charge injection mismatch is reduced from 1.5 nA to 150 pA by post production trimming with an on-chip charge mismatch compensation circuit.},

abstract={A 40 MHz-BW 10 bit two-step VCO-based Delta-Sigma ADC is presented. With the open-loop structure and highly digital building blocks, a robust performance, high bandwidth and high power efficiency are achieved. The nonlinearities of the coarse and the fine VCO-based quantizers are mitigated by distortion cancellation and voltage swing reduction schemes respectively. Because of the intrinsic DEM of the VCO-based quantizer output, the matching requirement of the DAC cells is greatly relaxed. The experimental results in 40 nm CMOS show that, with 1.6 GHz sampling frequency, the proposed ADC reaches 59.5 dB SNDR and 67.7 dB SFDR for 40 MHz bandwidth. The power consumption is only 2.57 mW under 0.9 V power supply, corresponding the best FoM (42 fJ/step) among high bandwidth ( 20 MHz) DS ADCs.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={3}, 
pages={749-762}, 
abstract={This paper presents a network-on-chip (NoC) SerDes transceiver architecture for long distance interconnects in the mm range within MPSoCs. Its source synchronous clocking scheme enables application in GALS systems and allows completely stoppable transceiver clocking for low idle power consumption. A capacitive line driver with combined resistive driver for well defined DC swing is employed and analyzed in detail by simulation studies. It is shown that proper DC swing definition is mandatory for robust operation of long links at high data rates. Prototypes of the transceiver over 6 mm bufferless on-chip interconnect are implemented in both 65 nm and 28 nm CMOS technologies. The 65 nm realization achieves an efficiency of 173 fJ/bit/mm at 90 Gbit/s at 1.25 V and 93 fJ/bit/mm at 45 Gbit/s low speed mode at 0.9 V. The 28 nm realization achieves 81 fJ/bit/mm at 72 Gbit/s at 1.05 V and 64 fJ/bit/mm at 36 Gbit/s low speed mode at 0.95 V. The transceiver can be seamlessly integrated as black box point-to-point connection into heterogeneous MPSoC NoCs to enable ultra-compact toplevel floorplan realization and increased energy efficiency. An example of a 20-core MPSoC in 65 nm CMOS technology with 10 serial NoC transceivers is presented.},

A 0.064 μm2 and a 0.080 μm2 6T SRAM bitcells are designed for high-density (HD) and high-performance (HP) applications. To improve VMIN of the high-density SRAM, a negative bitline scheme (NBL) is adopted as a write-assist technique. Then, the disturbance-noise reduction (DNR) scheme is proposed as a read-assist circuit to improve the VMIN of the high-performance SRAM. The 128 Mb 6T-HD SRAM test-chip is fully demonstrated featuring 0.50 VMIN with 200 mV improvement by NBL, and 0.47 VMIN for the 128 Mb 6T-HP with 40 mV improvement by the DNR. Improved VMIN reduces 45.4% and 12.2% power-consumption of the SRAM macro with the help of each assist circuit, respectively.},

title={An Ultra-Low Phase Noise Class-F 2 CMOS Oscillator With 191 dBc/Hz FoM and Long-Term Reliability}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={3}, 
pages={679-692}, 
abstract={In this paper, we propose a new class of operation of an RF oscillator that minimizes its phase noise. The main idea is to enforce a clipped voltage waveform around the LC tank by increasing the second-harmonic of fundamental oscillation voltage through an additional impedance peak, thus giving rise to a class-F 2 operation. As a result, the noise contribution of the tail current transistor on the total phase noise can be significantly decreased without sacrificing the oscillator's voltage and current efficiencies. Furthermore, its special impulse sensitivity function (ISF) reduces the phase sensitivity to thermal circuit noise. The prototype of the class-F 2 oscillator is implemented in standard TSMC 65 nm CMOS occupying 0.2 mm 2 . It draws 32-38 mA from 1.3 V supply. Its tuning range is 19% covering 7.2-8.8 GHz. It exhibits phase noise of -139 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset from 8.7 GHz carrier, translated to an average figure-of-merit of 191 dBc/Hz with less than 2 dB variation across the tuning range. The long term reliability is also investigated with estimated >10 year lifetime.},

abstract={In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless, i.e., simultaneous transmission and reception at the same frequency, introduces strong self-interference (SI) that masks the signal to be received. This paper proposes a receiver in which a copy of the transmit signal is fed through a switched-resistor vector modulator (VM) that provides simultaneous downmixing, phase shift, and amplitude scaling and subtracts it in the analog baseband for up to 27 dB SI-cancellation. Cancelling before active baseband amplification avoids self-blocking, and highly linear mixers keep SI-induced distortion low, for a receiver SI-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SINDR) of up to 71.5 dB in 16.25 MHz BW. When combined with a two-port antenna with only 20 dB isolation, the low RX distortion theoretically allows sufficient digital cancellation for over 90 dB link budget, sufficient for short-range, low-power FD links.},

pages={2613-2624}, 
abstract={A 16.8 Gbps/channel single-ended transceiver for SiP-based DRAM interface on silicon carrier channel is proposed in this paper. A transmitter, receiver, and channel are all included in a single package as SiP. A current mode 4:1 MUX with 1-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is used as a serializer, and this 4:1 MUX uses 25% duty clock to prevent short circuit current when consecutive 2-phase clocks overlap. Additionally, an open drain output driver with asynchronous type 1-tap FFE is used in the transmitter. Because of its small physical size, a common mode variation of Si-carrier channel from process variation is more serious than that of conventional PCB. This common mode variation degrades bit error rates (BER) at single-ended signaling. To obtain effective single-ended signaling on Si-carrier channel, a source follower-based continuous time linear equalizers and self- VREF generator with training algorithm on the receiver are proposed. An implemented Si-carrier channel uses meshed layer as a reference to reduce insertion loss. A BER less than 1e-12 is achieved in 65 nm CMOS and the power efficiency of the transceiver is 5.9 pJ/bit with 120 Ω terminations at each transceiver side.},

abstract={In this paper, a baseband ASIC which supports receive diversity and soft-output Viterbi equalization for enhanced 2G networks is presented. It includes a transmitter and receiver with a symbol detector and a decoder with a dedicated incremental redundancy implementation, as well as the necessary control capability to autonomously communicate with the RF-IC.

title={A Reconfigurable Dual-Output Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Regulator With Sub-Harmonic Adaptive-On-Time Control for Low-Power Applications}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={3}, 
pages={724-736}, 
abstract={This paper presents a reconfigurable switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC regulator to simultaneously generate two different regulated output voltages for low-power applications. With capacitor and power switch sharing in the power stage, the area efficiency of the proposed regulator is improved. The proposed power stage can also be configured to provide different conversion ratios in order to maintain high power efficiency of the regulator in different input voltages. A sub-harmonic adaptive-on-time (SHAOT) control scheme is developed to regulate both outputs. The adaptive-on-time control automatically adjusts the durations of charge transfer to both outputs to reduce output voltage ripples under different input voltages. Switching power transistors at the fundamental or sub-harmonics of the system clock frequency can provide predictable noise spectrum to both regulated outputs and improve the light-load regulator power efficiency. The cross regulation between both outputs can also be minimized by the proposed SHAOT scheme. Implemented in a standard 0.35 μm CMOS process, the proposed regulator provides two regulated outputs of 2 V and 3 V and delivers up to 12 mA at each output. The proposed regulator achieves a maximum power efficiency of 89.5%. Both power efficiency and output ripple can be improved by 10% and ~ 4 times, respectively, over a wide input range from 1.1 V to 1.8 V by using the proposed reconfigurable power stage and adaptive-on-time scheme.},

pages={610-618}, 
abstract={Spatial thermal distribution of a chip is an essential information for dynamic thermal management. To get a rich thermal map, the sensor area is required to be reduced radically. However, squeezing the sensor size is about to face its physical limitation. In this background, we propose an area-efficient thermal sensing technique: hybrid temperature sensor network. The proposed sensor architecture fully exploits the spatial low-pass filtering effect of thermal systems, which implies that most of the thermal information resides in very low spatial frequency region. Our on-chip sensor network consists of a small number of accurate thermal sensors and a large number of tiny relative thermal sensors, responsible for low and high spatial frequency thermal information respectively. By combining these sensor readouts, a thermal map upsampler synthesizes a higher spatial resolution thermal map with a proposed guided upsampling algorithm.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1094-1106}, 
abstract={This paper presents a digital polar Doherty power amplifier (PA) fully integrated in a 65 nm bulk CMOS process. It achieves +27.3 dBm peak output power and 32.5% peak PA drain efficiency at 3.82 GHz and 3.60 GHz, respectively. The proposed digital Doherty PA architecture optimizes the cooperation of the main and auxiliary amplifiers and achieves superior back-off efficiency enhancement (a maximum 47.9% improvement versus the corresponding Class-B operation). This digital intensive architecture also allows in-field PA reconfigurability which both provides robust PA operation against antenna mismatches and allows flexible trade-off optimization on PA efficiency and linearity. Transformer-based passives are employed as the Doherty input and output networks. The input 90 ° signal splitter is realized by a 6-port folded differential transformer structure. The active Doherty load modulation and power combining at the PA output are achieved by two transformers in a parallel configuration. These transformer-based passives ensure an ultra-compact PA design (2.1 mm 2) and broad bandwidth (24.9% for -1 dB P out bandwidth). Measurement with 1 MSym/s QPSK signal shows 3.5% rms EVM with +23.5 dBm average output power and 26.8% PA drain efficiency. Measurement with 16-QAM signal exhibits the PA's flexibility on optimizing efficiency and linearity.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-power first-order frequency synthesizer architecture suitable for high-speed on-chip clock generation. The proposed design features an architecture combining an LC quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), two sample-and-holds, a phase interpolator, digital coarse-tuning and rotational frequency detection for fine-tuning. Similar to multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs), this architecture limits jitter accumulation to one reference cycle, as jitter during one reference cycle does not contribute to the next reference cycles. Also, instead of using multiplexer switches commonly employed in MDLLs, the reference clock edge is injected by phase interpolation to support higher frequencies and lower jitter. Functionality of the frequency synthesizer is validated between 8-9.5 GHz, LC VCO's range of operation. First-order dynamic of the acquisition has been analyzed and demonstrated through measurement. The output clock at 8 GHz has an integrated rms jitter of 490 fs, peak-to-peak periodic jitter of 2.06 ps and total rms jitter of 680 fs. Different components of jitter have been analyzed and separate measurements have been done to support the analysis. The reference spurs are measured to be -64.3 dB below the carrier frequency. At 8 GHz the system consumes 2.49 mW from a 1 V supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a delta-sigma modulator operating at a supply voltage of 0.4 V. The designed delta-sigma modulator uses a proposed hybrid switching integrator and operates at a low supply voltage without clock boosting or bootstrapped switches. The proposed integrator consists of both switched-resistor and switched-capacitor operations and significantly reduces distortion at a low supply voltage. Variation in the turn-on resistance, which is the main source of distortion, is avoided by placing the switches at the virtual ground node of the amplifier. The proposed low-voltage design scheme can replace commonly-used clock boosting techniques, which rely on internal high-voltage generation circuits. A fabricated modulator achieves a 76.1 dB signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) and an 82 dB dynamic range at a 20 kHz bandwidth. The measured total power consumption is 63 μW from a 0.4 V supply voltage. The measured results show robust SNDR performance, even at ±10% supply voltage variations. The measured results also show stable performance over a wide temperature range.},

Only the first stage is left in the analog domain. Because of high integration of digital circuitry, it could benefit from process advancement such as low power consumption and small area. Moreover, the excess loop delay (ELD) is compensated in the digital domain, and the conventional analog local feedback DAC for ELD compensation is no longer needed. In addition, resistive DAC (R-DAC) is adopted for low flicker noise.

pages={597-609}, 
abstract={This work introduces a 2-D phased array architecture that is suitable for high power radiation at mm-Wave and Terahertz frequencies. We address the challenge of signal generation above the cut-off frequency of transistors by presenting a radiation method based on the collective performance of a large number of synchronized sources. As theory shows, both frequency locking/tuning and beam steering can be independently achieved by manipulating the local coupling between the nearest neighbors. This control method results in a dynamical network that is insensitive to array dimensions and is scalable to the point that can achieve a level of output power and spectral purity beyond the reach of conventional sources. To demonstrate the concept, we implement a 4 ×4 version of this phased array at 340 GHz using a 65 nm bulk CMOS process. The paper presents the design and implementation of the oscillators, couplings and the integrated antennas. The measured results at 338 GHz reveal a peak equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of +17.1 dBm and a phase noise of -93 dBc/Hz at the 1 MHz offset frequency. This chip presents the first fully integrated terahertz phased array on silicon. Furthermore, the output power is higher than any lens-less silicon-based source above 200 GHz and the phase noise is lower than all silicon radiating sources above 100 GHz.},

pages={2665-2677}, 
abstract={This paper presents a direct-sampling pulsed radar with a high-resolution digital-to-time converter (DTC) for estimating the time of flight (TOF), which is to identify the distance between a target and radar. The implemented direct-sampling radar can reconstruct the scanning waveforms in digital domain. The link budget of the radar transceivers is analyzed for the overall scanning range. The scanning range of the radar is dependent on the TOF between radar transmitter and receiver. The range resolution of the pulsed TOF radar is determined by DTC. With the help of exquisite DTC, a high resolution radar can be achieved. The vernier concept has been adopted to achieve an accurate timing resolution design in the DTC. The vernier time steps are defined by the oscillating frequency of the phase-locked loops (PLL), and therefore the DTC with a high resolution in the order of picosecond and with high immunity to PVT variation was developed and demonstrated. The proposed radar was fabricated using 65 nm CMOS technology and occupies a chip area of 2 mm 2, consumes 88.4 mW of DC power. The receiver has a 10 GHz instantaneous front-end bandwidth for capturing all scattering reflected waveforms and a 666 GS/s equivalent sampling rate for recording all received signals for subsequent digital signal processing (DSP) analysis.},

abstract={This study introduces a 5.8 GHz RF-powered transceiver that includes a transmitter using an IF-based quadrature backscattering (IFQB) technique. The IFQB transmitter can produce a quadrature modulated signal without active RF circuits, such as PLL, local generation, and local distribution circuits. Thus, the IFQB technique can significantly reduce the power consumption while achieving denser constellations by the quadrature modulation. The RF-powered transceiver consists of the IFQB transmitter, an OOK receiver, and a power management unit (PMU) for RF powering. The transmitter and receiver operate under a 0.6 V power supply provided by the PMU to further reduce the power consumption. We fabricated a prototype RF-powered transceiver using a 65 nm Si CMOS process to confirm the validity of the proposed technique. During the measurements, the transmitter achieved 2.5 Mb/s with a 32-QAM modulation while consuming 113 μW. In addition, a wireless temperature sensing demonstration was conducted using the prototype sensor node with the presented RF-powered transceiver.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates a 2-phase 11/1 switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter that provides an output voltage VOUT of 3.3 V from an input voltage VIN in the range of 37.4 V-39 V . SC converters, unlike their inductive buck counterparts, do not rely on the pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle to set the voltage conversion ratio (VCR) as this is determined by the SC converter topology. Consequently, SC DC-DC converters do not require a very low duty cycle, resulting in a short ton for the full-input-voltage-rated high-side switch and significant driver power consumption. Instead, a two-phase SC converter is found to be an excellent candidate for high-ratio voltage conversion as it maintains a 50% duty cycle and exchanges few components of high voltage rating with more that are rated for lower voltage.},

We present (i) an adaptive switch-size scaling scheme for maximum efficiency tracking across a wide range of voltages and currents, governed by a frequency-based control law that is experimentally validated across multiple dies and temperatures and, (ii) a simple active ripple mitigation technique that modulates the gate drive of select MOSFET switches effectively in all conversion modes. Efficiency improvements up to 15% are measured under low output voltage and load conditions. Load-independent output ripple of <;50 mV is achieved, enabling reduced interleaving. Test chip implementations and measurements demonstrate ease of integration in SoC designs, power efficiency benefits and EMI/RFI improvements.},

pages={1148-1164}, 
abstract={This paper presents a high-performance two-path wideband receiver (RX) for 4G LTE applications. The RX uses an extra GM stage after the LNA to improve the noise figure (NF). Furthermore, different RF and baseband blocker rejection techniques are proposed to significantly improve the linearity of the RX. The blockers are first rejected after the LNA stage through an N-path filter. Then, a novel base-band blocker filtering (BBBF) technique improves IIP3 by 7 dB. A dual-mixer architecture is also employed to attenuate blockers both before and after the mixer stage. The N-path filter noise is sensed out-of-phase by the RX main path and cancelled at the inputs of the shared TIA. The RX achieves 1.8 dB NF with 50 dB gain at 2 GHz in 40 nm CMOS technology. The RX out-of-band IIP3 is +5 dBm, which is improved by 20 dB employing the proposed techniques, while consuming 36 mW.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50},

pages={3089-3100}, 
abstract={This paper presents a power- and area-efficient multistandard serial link transceiver designed for backplane application rates of up to 28 Gb/s, such as OIF CEI-25G, CEI-28G, and IEEE 802.3bj 100G-KR4. The receiver features a continuous-time linear equalizer, variable gain amplifier, and a 14-tap decision feedback equalizer, including eight floating taps. The transmitter has a 2:1 multiplexer with a duty cycle distortion corrected half-rate clock and a full-rate source-series terminated driver with a 5-tap feed-forward equalizer. The shared PLL employs a transformer-based LC-VCO that achieves a VCO tuning range of 20G to 29 GHz and 0.23 ps RMS jitter at 28.125 GHz. The transmitter output shows only 50 fs duty-cycle distortion. The transceiver can compensate a 40 dB insertion loss backplane channel (excluding package) at a data rate of 25.78 Gb/s with eight channels running simultaneously. It is fabricated in 28 nm standard CMOS and analog section consumes only 295 mW at 1 V supply with transmitter driver at 1.25 V. Such low power consumption and performance are achieved by combination of advanced 28 nm process, low power and performance driven receiver and transmitter topologies, widely adopted bandwidth extension techniques, built-in analog calibrations and one common PLL with a transformer based VCO for four transceivers.},

abstract={A high-power 320 GHz transmitter using 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology (fT/fmax = 220/280 GHz) is reported. This transmitter consists of a 4 × 4 array of radiators based on coupled harmonic oscillators. By incorporating a signal filter structure called return-path gap coupler into a differential self-feeding oscillator, the proposed 320 GHz radiator simultaneously maximizes the fundamental oscillation power, harmonic generation, as well as on-chip radiation. To facilitate the TX-RX synchronization of a future terahertz (THz) heterodyne imaging chipset, a fully-integrated phase-locked loop (PLL) is also implemented in the transmitter. Such on-chip phase-locking capability is the first demonstration for all THz radiators in silicon. In the far-field measurement, the total radiated power and EIRP of the chip is 3.3 mW and 22.5 dBm, respectively. The transmitter consumes 610 mW DC power, which leads to a DC-to-THz radiation efficiency of 0.54%. To the authors' best knowledge, this work presents the highest radiated power and DC-to-THz radiation efficiency in silicon-based THz radiating sources.},

title={An Impedance and Multi-Wavelength Near-Infrared Spectroscopy IC for Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Estimation}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={4}, 
pages={1025-1037}, 
abstract={A multi-modal spectroscopy IC combining impedance spectroscopy (IMPS) and multi-wavelength near-infrared spectroscopy (mNIRS) is proposed for high precision non-invasive glucose level estimation. A combination of IMPS and mNIRS can compensate for the glucose estimation error to improve its accuracy. The IMPS circuit measures dielectric characteristics of the tissue using the RLC resonant frequency and the resonant impedance to estimate the glucose level. To accurately find resonant frequency, a 2-step frequency sweep sinusoidal oscillator (FSSO) is proposed: 1) 8-level coarse frequency switching (fSTEP = 9.4 kHz) in 10-76 kHz, and 2) fine analog frequency sweep in the range of 18.9 kHz. During the frequency sweep, the adaptive gain control loop stabilizes the output voltage swing (400 mVp-p). To improve accuracy of mNIRS, three wavelengths, 850 nm, 950 nm, and 1,300 nm, are used. For highly accurate glucose estimation, the measurement data of the IMPS and mNIRS are combined by an artificial neural network (ANN) in external DSP. The proposed ANN method reduces the mean absolute relative difference to 8.3% from 15% of IMPS, and 15-20% of mNIRS in 80-180 mg/dL blood glucose level. The proposed multi-modal spectroscopy IC occupies 12.5 mm 2 in a 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS technology and dissipates a peak power of 38 mW with the maximum radiant emitting power of 12.1 mW.},

abstract={We present a batteryless, crystal-free, time division multiple access (TDMA) synchronized multinode wireless body sensor node (WBSN) system-on-chip (SoC), referred to as a Bionode, for continuous and real-time telemetry of electromyograms (EMGs), enabling intuitive upper limb prosthesis control by an amputee. The SoC utilizes state of the art in supercapacitive RF energy harvesting, biosensing analog-front-end, switchingoptimized SAR ADC, ultra-low-power RF transceiver, and clock circuits. The sensor node SoCs are time synchronized with a base station, mounted on the prosthetic arm, by using the ultra-lowpower TDMA controller and receiver, and the digital core circuits. A 915 MHz broadcast RF signal is utilized to synthesize the carrier frequency of the transmitter. This along with the process and voltage compensated on-chip clock obviates the need for a bulky crystal oscillator, thus providing a low-cost and highly integrated solution to the WBSNs. The SoC is verified by capturing the EMG data from a healthy human body and consumes only 24 μW, while operating exclusively from the harvested RF energy. Implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS process, the SoC occupies 2.025 mm2 silicon area. The sensor node has an extremely low weight and physical dimensions, thanks to the flexible carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitor, electrically small antenna (ESA), and crystal-free operation of the SoC.},

This AP has a combination of high-performance 2 GHz cores and energy-efficient 1 GHz cores. The maximum performance in the octa-core configuration is 35,600 DMIPS. The key design highlights are as follows. 1) Using a dedicated PLL and H-tree clock in the high-performance CPU achieves both 2 GHz operation and reduced dynamic power. 2) A low-leakage SRAM in a 28 nm HPM process is used and the leakage current of the peripheral circuits of the SRAM macro is optimized via multiple threshold voltages (Vt) and gate lengths (Lg), resulting in 24% leakage reduction of L1 cache. 3) The effects of process and voltage variations are accurately corrected by an on-chip process sensor and direct sensing of the voltage in the power mesh of the chip. 20% dynamic power reduction, 29% leakage power reduction and 40 mV improvement of minimum operation voltage are achieved. 4) An enhanced CPU clock control mechanism is employed, which uses an on-chip delay sensor to reduce AC voltage drop. 5) The heterogeneous CPU architecture maintains high performance even during thermal throttling.},

abstract={The designs of resistive RAM (ReRAM) macros are limited by 1) a small sensing margin, limited read- VDDmin, and slow read access time (TAC) caused by a high cell-resistance and small cell-resistance-ratio (R-ratio) and 2) poor power integrity and increased energy waste attributable to a large SET dc-current (IDC-SET) resulting from the wide distribution of write (SET)-times (TSET). This study proposes a swing-sample-and-couple (SSC) voltage-mode sense amplifier (VSA) to enable an approximately 1.8+x greater sensing margin for lower VDD min and a 1.7+x faster read speed across a wide VDD range, compared with conventional VSAs. A 4T self-boost-write-termination (SBWT) scheme is proposed to cut off the IDC-SET of devices with a rapid T SET. The SBWT scheme reduces 99+% of the IDC-SET with an area penalty below 0.5%. A fabricated 512 row 28 nm 1 Mb ReRAM macro achieved TAC = 404 ns when VDD=0.27 V and confirmed the IDC-SET cutoff by the SBWT.},

abstract={The ring amplifier is an energy efficient and high output swing alternative to an OTA for switched-capacitor circuits. However, the conventional ring amplifier requires external biases, which makes the ring amplifier less practical when we consider process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation. This paper presents a self-biased ring amplifier scheme that makes the ring amplifier more practical and power efficient while maintaining the benefits of efficient slew-based charging and an almost rail-to-rail output swing. We introduce an improved auto-zero scheme that eliminates the gain error caused by the parasitic capacitance across the auto-zero switch. Furthermore, a comparator-less pipeline ADC structure takes advantage of the characteristics of the ring-amplifier to replace the sub-ADC in each pipeline stage. The prototype ADC has measured SNDR, SNR and SFDR of 56.6 dB (9.11 b), 57.5 dB and 64.7 dB, respectively, for a Nyquist frequency input sampled at 100 MS/s, and consumes 2.46 mW.},

abstract={A software-defined radio receiver that is suitable for intra-band carrier aggregation is demonstrated. The RF front-end frequency selectivity is enhanced by the combination of the passive mixer and a proposed reconfigurable transimpedance amplifier. High order bandpass filtering function with frequency notches can be achieved at the front-end. Current domain complex signal processing is explored to select and separate multiple channels concurrently. The receiver contains a variety of functional building blocks that can be connected in different ways to form various architectures. The fine-grained programmability of component parameters and reconfigurability of receiver schemes enable optimum performance under varying signal and blocker scenarios. A proof-of-concept CMOS chip fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology is presented that supports up to three-channel aggregation. The receiver operates at any frequency between 0.5 to 3 GHz. The frequency separation between the concurrent RF channels can be tuned anywhere between 0 to +100 MHz. The concurrent receiver scheme can also be explored to reject large near-band blockers for high dynamic range.},

abstract={This paper presents a design approach for upgrading the resiliency of ultra-low-voltage (ULV) microprocessors through a voltage-scalable and low-overhead in-situ error detection and correction (EDAC) technique. Particular efforts are made to overcome the poor voltage scalability and area/energy/throughput overhead of the existing EDAC techniques when applied to ULV designs. The 16 bit microprocessor employing the proposed EDAC and dynamic voltage scaling schemes is demonstrated in a 65 nm. The microprocessor can automatically modulate VDD based on timing error flags across static/slow variations and in-situ detect and correct the timing errors from fast dynamic variations, virtually eliminating timing and voltage margins. At a typical process/voltage/temperature corner, the proposed design improves the minimum energy consumption by 42% with 140 mV additional voltage scaling, as compared to the baseline design. At the same throughput (80 MHz), the proposed design consumes 38% less energy than the baseline operating at its minimum energy point. At the same energy consumption, the proposed design achieves 2.3 × higher throughput than the baseline design. The area overhead of the proposed design is 8.3%.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2441-2450}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a low-power effective memory-size expanded ternary content addressable memory (TCAM). The IP address of IPv6 extends to 128 bits, where the prefix bits store `0' or `1' and the remaining bits store `X' (don't care). Most prefixes are much shorter than 128 bits, so many TCAM cells store `X'. The proposed data-relocation TCAM (DR-TCAM) increases the number of IP addresses stored in the TCAM by relocating the data in the prefix bits into `X' cells. The DR-TCAM has four types of banks. The type-0 bank is empty and inactivated. The type-1 and type-2 banks store four 32 bit words and two 64 bit words instead of a 128 bit word in the type-3 bank, respectively. Therefore, the type-1 and type-2 banks store four and two times larger IP addresses, respectively. In the simulation, the area and power consumption of the DR-TCAM decreased to 34% and 36% of those of the conventional TCAM for 4 K IP addresses, respectively. The DR-TCAM chip with 256 × 128 bit TCAM cells and 8 banks was fabricated using a 1.2 V 0.13 μm CMOS process. Its area was 0.87 mm 2 . Its energy/bit/search was 1.3 fJ at 200 MHz clock frequency when 4 banks were activated to store 256 IP addresses.},

abstract={This paper presents a 14 bit 35 MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) ADC that achieves a nearly constant 74.5 dB peak SNDR up to Nyquist and an SFDR of 90/99 dB for inputs near Nyquist and at low-frequencies, respectively. The ADC employs a loop-embedded input buffer that shields the large sampling capacitor from the input and thereby eases the ADC drive requirements significantly. Since the buffer's nonlinearity is cancelled by the SAR operation, a pair of basic source followers can be used, adding only 12.5 mW (23% of the total power) to the power budget. The ADC includes a bandgap reference and a self-calibrated current steering DAC to close the SAR loop, which eliminates the need for a low-impedance off-chip reference. The design occupies 0.236 mm 2 in 40 nm CMOS and consumes a total power of 54.5 mW from its 1.2/2.5 V supplies, leading to an SNDR-based Schreier FOM of 159.5 dB at Nyquist.},

abstract={We present an energy/illumination-adaptive CMOS image sensor for distributed wireless sensor applications. The adaptive feature enables always-on imaging operation with extremely low power consumption for extended lifetime of wireless image sensor nodes and provides optimum images in a wide range of illuminations. For adaptive operation, the sensor employs reconfigurable modes of operation. Most of time, the sensor is in a monitoring mode, which keeps imaging at extremely low power consumption. The sensor turns into a high-sensitivity imaging mode or a wide dynamic range imaging mode when illumination varies and sufficient power supply is available from energy harvesting. The sensor changes its operation back to the monitoring mode in order to save energy in the battery. The sensor operates at 1.36 μW/frame in the monitoring mode from harvested energy and provides high-sensitive (24 V/lx·sec) and wide dynamic range images (99.2 dB) at 867 μW in battery operation.

abstract={A 1 mm pitch 80 X 80 channel 322 Hz framerate capacitive multitouch distribution sensor has been developed. High-resolution multiple touch points are detected including touch-strength distribution around them. A two-step dual-mode capacitance scan scheme is proposed, where self- and mutual-capacitance measurements are hierarchically performed in two steps to increase the frame scan rate that is otherwise reduced due to high resolution. 160 row-and-column dedicated parallel ADCs further increase the scan rate. A time-domain counter-based slope ADC suppresses power and area penalty for the parallel ADC approach.

abstract={A quadrature LC-VCO incorporating passive coupling and broadband harmonic combining for frequency multiplication by 4, and NMOS switched variable inductors is fabricated in 65 nm bulk CMOS to generate signals at 85 to 127 GHz. The passive quadrature coupling bypasses the need for a broadband on-chip bias-T, while reducing power consumption, phase noise, and the theoretical conversion loss for the 4th order harmonic generation by 3 dB over the linear superposition. The 39% frequency tuning range is at least 4x higher than the other CMOS implementations with center frequency over 90 GHz. At power consumption of 30-45 mW from a 1.5 V power supply, the measured output power varies from -15 to -23 dBm and phase noise at 10 MHz offset varies from -108 to -102 dBc/Hz over the output frequency range. These are sufficient for use in millimeter wave rotational spectroscopy.},

abstract={A hybrid phase/current-mode phase interpolator (HPC-PI) is presented to improve phase noise performance of ring oscillator based fractional-N PLLs. The proposed HPC-PI alleviates the bandwidth trade-off between VCO phase noise suppression and ΔΣ quantization noise suppression. By combining the phase detection and interpolation functions into XOR phase detector/interpolator (XOR PD-PI) block, accurate quantization error cancellation is achieved without using calibration. Use of a digital MDLL in front of the fractional-N PLL helps in alleviating the bandwidth limitation due to reference frequency and enables bandwidth extension even further. The extended bandwidth helps in suppressing the ring-VCO phase noise and lowering the in-band noise floor. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype generates fractional frequencies from 4.25 to 4.75 GHz, with in-band phase noise floor of -104 dBc/Hz and 1.5 ps rms integrated jitter. The clock multiplier achieves power efficiency of 2.4 mW/GHz and FoM of -225.8 dB.},

abstract={Integrated sensor interface circuits require energy-efficient high-resolution data converters. This paper proposes a two-step incremental A/D converter (IADC) which extends the performance of an Nth-order IADC close to that of a (2N-1)th-order IADC. The implemented device uses the circuitry of a second-order IADC (IADC2) to achieve close to third-order SNR performance. The proposed circuit does not require very high opamp DC gain; the gain can be as low as 60 dB for 100 dB SNR data conversion. The implemented IADC achieves a measured dynamic range of 99.8 dB, and an SNDR of 91 dB for a maximum input 2.2 VPP and a bandwidth of 250 Hz. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the IADC's core area is 0.2 mm2, and it consumes only 10.7 μW. The measured FoMs are 0.76 pJ/conversion and 173.5 dB, both among the best reported results for IADCs. The measured results verify that the proposed two-step IADC is a more energy-efficient data conversion scheme than conventional high-order IADCs.},

abstract={An electrical impedance tomography (EIT) SoC is proposed for the portable real-time lung ventilation monitoring system. The proposed EIT SoC is integrated into belt-typefabric system with 32 electrodes and can show the dynamic images of the lung ventilation on the mobile devices. To get high fidelity images, a T-switch is adopted for high off-isolation between electrodes more than 60 dB, and I/Q signal generation and demodulation can obtain both real and imaginary part of images. For the real-time imaging, an on-chip fast demodulation scheme is proposed, and it can also reduce speed requirements of ADC for low-power consumption. The proposed EIT SoC of 5.0 mm × 5.0 mm is fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS technology, and consumes only 10.4 mW with 1.8 V supply. As a result, EIT images were reconstructed with 97.3% of accuracy and up to 20 frames/s real-time lung images can be displayed on the mobile devices.},

title={Design of On-Chip Gate Drivers With Power-Efficient High-Speed Level Shifting and Dynamic Timing Control for High-Voltage Synchronous Switching Power Converters}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1463-1477}, 
abstract={Two integrated high-speed gate drivers to enable high-frequency operation of synchronous rectifiers in high-voltage switching power converters are presented in this paper. The first synchronous gate driver for a CMOS power train consists of a capacitively coupled level shifter (CCLS) that offers negligible propagation delays and no static current consumption, and requires only one off-chip capacitor to enable high-side power pMOS driving capability without any external floating supply. The second synchronous gate driver consists of a low-power high-speed dynamically controlled level shifter (DCLS) with a reliability-enhanced error-suppression technique for driving a dual-nMOS power train. In addition, a dynamic timing control (DTC) is developed to generate proper dead time for power FETs in order to enable soft switching operation of the converter under different input voltages for enhancing the converter reliability. The converter power efficiency can be also improved by minimizing both switching and short-circuit power losses under high-input-voltage conditions. Implemented in a 0.5 μm 120 V CMOS process, both proposed CCLS and DCLS have demonstrated to shift up 5 V signal to 100 V and 40 V, respectively, improving the FoM by at least 10 times and 2.9 times compared to respective state-of-the-art level shifters. The DTC circuit enables proper ZVS operation in a synchronous buck converter with the CCLS-based gate driver over a wide input supply range from 40 V to 100 V, providing a converter maximum power-efficiency improvement of 11.5%.},

title={Compact and Supply-Voltage-Scalable Temperature Sensors for Dense On-Chip Thermal Monitoring}, 
year={2015},

pages={2773-2785}, 
abstract={This paper presents compact and voltage-scalable temperature sensor circuits for implementing dynamic thermal management (DTM) in high-performance microprocessors and Systems-on-Chips (SoC). The proposed sensor front ends require only 6 to 8 NMOS transistors, resulting in more than one order of magnitude smaller area than the previous state of the art. The sensor supply voltage can be scaled down to 0.6 V, so it can be integrated with digital circuits employing a dynamic-voltage-scaling technique without additional power distribution and regulation. Sensor front ends with three different sizes (115, 279, and 400 μm2) and their back ends have been prototyped in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The measurement results of the 279 μm2 front end at 0.6 V show a worst-case error of 7.0° C across 64 instances 0° C to 100° C after a low-cost one-temperature-point calibration. With the same conditions, the measurements of the 400 μm2 front end show a worst-case error of 5.4° C across 64 instances. The compact sensor designs make it possible to integrate an order of magnitude more sensors on a chip with little additional overhead and thereby enable very dense thermal monitoring in digital VLSI systems.},

Power efficiency is improved with several techniques. An on-chip controller based on an embedded PowerPC™ 405 processor applies per-core DVFS by adjusting DPLLs and fully integrated voltage regulators. Each voltage regulator is a highly distributed system of digitally controlled microregulators, which achieves a peak power efficiency of 90.5%. A wide frequency range resonant clock design is used in 13 clock meshes and demonstrates a minimum power savings of 4%. Power and delay efficiency is achieved through the use of pulsed-clock latches, which require statistical validation to ensure robust yield.},

pages={344-359}, 
abstract={Emerging applications in brain-machine interface systems require high-resolution, chronic multisite cortical recordings, which cannot be obtained with existing technologies due to high power consumption, high invasiveness, or inability to transmit data wirelessly. In this paper, we describe a microsystem based on electrocorticography (ECoG) that overcomes these difficulties, enabling chronic recording and wireless transmission of neural signals from the surface of the cerebral cortex. The device is comprised of a highly flexible, high-density, polymer-based 64-channel electrode array and a flexible antenna, bonded to 2.4 mm × 2.4 mm CMOS integrated circuit (IC) that performs 64-channel acquisition, wireless power and data transmission. The IC digitizes the signal from each electrode at 1 kS/s with 1.2 μV input referred noise, and transmits the serialized data using a 1 Mb/s backscattering modulator. A dual-mode power-receiving rectifier reduces data-dependent supply ripple, enabling the integration of small decoupling capacitors on chip and eliminating the need for external components. Design techniques in the wireless and baseband circuits result in over 16× reduction in die area with a simultaneous 3× improvement in power efficiency over the state of the art. The IC consumes 225 μW and can be powered by an external reader transmitting 12 mW at 300 MHz, which is over 3× lower than IEEE and FCC regulations.},

abstract={This paper introduces a 2nd harmonic extraction technique and its implementation in a 46.4-58.1 GHz frequency synthesizer. The frequency doubling approach is based on tapping second harmonic signals at the VCO supply and tail nodes and amplifying them to provide a differential output. Since the amplifiers do not load the VCO outputs, the proposed technique does not affect either the tuning range or the frequency of the VCO. Moreover, a novel noise bypass technique is utilized to ensure that the amplifiers do not degrade the VCO phase noise. As a result, the frequency synthesizer achieves 22.4% tuning range (46.4-58.1 GHz) and phase noise below -118 dBc/Hz while consuming 66 mW from a 1 V supply. The stacked common gate amplifier can also be utilized for voltage regulation, providing a relatively constant FOM performance over a 2X power dissipation range. The synthesizer occupies 0.6 mm ×1 mm in IBM 32 nm SOI CMOS.},

abstract={Origami implant design is a 3D integration technique which addresses size and cost constraints in biomedical implants. This paper presents a capacitive proximity interconnect scheme that enables chip-to-chip communication across folds in the Origami implant, allowing increased flexibility of chip placement and orientation. The capacitive plate array senses link quality and chip-to-chip alignment, and adapts the data rate at each plate accordingly, shutting down poorly-coupled links to save power. Instead of using separate plate arrays for alignment sensing and communication, this interconnect embeds the alignment sensor and transceiver arrays within the same set of plates, so that link quality can be measured at the communications plates directly, thus simplifying their adaptation to alignment. In order to save power and area, the sensor circuitry is distributed across the array and shares functional blocks with the transceiver. Data rates from 10-60 Mbps are achieved over 4-12 μm of parylene-C, with efficiencies up to 0.180 pJ/bit.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={2}, 
pages={490-502}, 
abstract={A fast-wakeup bang-bang LC digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) suitable for low-power wireline applications is presented. The PLL uses a novel oscillator design to generate eight output phases using magnetic coupling. The fast-wakeup feature improves power efficiency by allowing PLL power-cycling while accommodating latency requirements. Fast lock upon wakeup is achieved by calibrating the phase of the feedback clock with respect to the reference clock using a first-order loop and is further assisted by on-the-fly adjustment of loop parameters. The eight-phase output clock is generated using a loop of four digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs) that are magnetically coupled through a passive structure. This structure enables magnetic coupling among oscillators with 2x area improvement over the prior art. As a result, in addition to eliminating the noise and parasitic capacitance of active coupling devices, the compact design reduces parasitic wiring capacitance, which is a significant limitation in high-frequency coupled oscillator design. Implemented in a 40 nm CMOS technology, the design achieves a 40-reference-cycle (100 ns) lock time and a 16% tuning range while producing an 8-phase output clock with less than 2° quadrature phase error up to 25 GHz. Measured PLL jitter is 392 fs (integrated from 100 kHz to 100 MHz) at 25 GHz while drawing 64 mW of power, 23 mW of which is consumed in the multiphase DCO. The DPLL occupies a total area of 0.1 mm2.},

pages={2451-2462}, 
abstract={This paper presents a Viterbi-specific 2T gain cell- based embedded DRAM (eDRAM) design for IEEE 802.11n WLAN application. In the proposed Viterbi decoder, refresh operations are completely removed in the eDRAM, by ensuring that the read-after-write period of survivor memory is shorter than the retention time of the gain cell. In order to facilitate the write operation with single-supply voltage, a beneficial read word-line (RWL) coupling technique is proposed. In this work, we also present a reference voltage generation scheme to support single-ended read operation. Thanks to the decoupled read and write structure of the gain cell, the proposed eDRAM can support dual-port operations without large area overhead, thus doubling the bandwidth of memories in the Viterbi decoder. To further reduce the area of the customized Viterbi memory, common redundant hardware between the memory peripheral and computational logics is identified and eliminated without latency overhead. The 4 bit soft-decision 64-state Viterbi decoder with 24 kb eDRAM (1-bank) is implemented in 65 nm CMOS process technology. The chip measurement results show 44% area and 39% power savings over the conventional SRAM-based Viterbi decoder implementation.},

pages={3101-3119}, 
abstract={A rapid-on/off transceiver for embedded clock architecture that enables energy proportional communication over the serial link is presented. In an energy proportional link, energy consumed by serial link is proportional to the amount of data communicated. Energy proportionality can be achieved by scaling the serial link power linearly with the link utilization, and fine grained rapid power state transition (rapid-on/off) is one such technique which can achieve this objective. In this paper, architecture and circuit techniques to achieve rapid-on/off in PLL, transmitter and receiver are discussed. Background phase calibration technique in PLL and CDR phase calibration logic in receiver enable instantaneous lock on power-on. The proposed transceiver demonstrates power scalability with a wide range of link utilization and, therefore, helps in improving overall system efficiency. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology, the 7 Gb/s transceiver achieves power-on-lock in less than 20 ns. Proposed PLL achieves power-on-lock in 1 ns. The transceiver achieves power scaling by 44 × (63.7 mW-to-1.43 mW) and energy efficiency degradation by only 2.2 × (9.1 pJ/bit-to-20.5 pJ/bit), when the effective data rate (link utilization) changes by 100 × (7 Gb/s-to-70 Mb/s). The proposed transceiver occupies an active die area of 0.39 mm 2.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50},

pages={2839-2848}, 
abstract={A fully integrated power management ASIC for efficient inductive power transmission has been presented capable of automatic load transformation using a method, called Q-modulation. Q-modulation is an adaptive scheme that offers load matching against a wide range of loading (RL) and coupling distance (d23) variations in inductive links to maintain high power transfer efficiency (PTE). It is suitable for inductive powering implantable microelectronic devices (IMDs), recharging mobile electronics, and electric vehicles. In Q-modulation, the zero-crossings of the induced current in the receiver (Rx) LC-tank are detected and a low-loss switch chops the Rx LC-tank for part of the power carrier cycle to form a high-Q LC-tank and store the maximum energy, which is then transferred to RL by opening the switch. By adjusting the duty cycle (D), the loaded-Q of the Rx LC-tank can be dynamically modulated to compensate for variations in RL. A Q-modulation power management (QMPM) prototype chip was fabricated in a 0.35 μm standard CMOS process, occupying 4.8 mm 2. In a 1.45 W wireless power transfer setup, using a class-E power amplifier (PA) operating at 2 MHz, the QMPM successfully increased the inductive link PTE and the overall power efficiency by 98.5% and 120.7% at d23 = 8 cm, respectively, by compensating for 150 Ω variation in RL at D = 45%.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1107-1116}, 
abstract={In this paper, we present a 25 dBm Class-D outphasing power amplifier (PA) with cross-bridge combiners. The Class-D PA is designed in a standard 45 nm process while the combiner is implemented on board using lumped elements for flexibilities in testing. Comparing with conventional non-isolated combiners, the elements of the cross-bridge combiner are carefully chosen so that additional resonance network is formed to reduce out-of-phase current, thereby increasing backoff efficiency of the outphasing PA. The Class-D outphasing PA with the proposed combiner is manufactured and measured at both 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz. It achieves 55% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 900 MHz and 45% at 2.4 GHz for a single tone input. For a 10 MHz LTE signal with 6 dB PAR, the PAE is 32% at 900 MHz with -39 dBc adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and 22% at 2.4 GHz with -33 dBc ACPR. With digital predistortion (DPD), the linearity of the PA at 2.4 GHz is improved further to reach -53 dBc, -50 dBc, -42 dBc ACPR for 10 MHz, 20 MHz, and 2-carrier 20 MHz LTE signals.},

year={2015},

number={9}, 
pages={2113-2126}, 
abstract={This paper describes a SOI MEMS oscillating accelerometer with a fully differential CMOS continuous-time read-out circuit. A new ultra-low-noise continuous-time bandpass transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is proposed and serves as the front-end of the read-out circuit. The new TIA topology greatly relaxes the tradeoffs among gain, bandwidth and noise, and achieves a state-of-the-art input referred current noise density of 6.6 fA/√Hz, which helps improve the bias-instability and noise floor of the MEMS oscillating accelerometer. The TIA provides a transimpedance gain of 45 MΩ in the bandwidth from 0.5 Hz to 350 kHz and consumes only 583 μW. To reduce the amplitude-stiffness effect induced frequency variation, the accelerometer employs a displacement control strategy that stabilizes the oscillation amplitude of the MEMS oscillator and a chopper stabilization technique to minimize the flicker noise in the amplitude control block. The accelerometer yields bias-instability of 0.6 μg (Allan Variance) or bias stability of 6.3 μg (1σ in one hour) and 2 μg/√Hz noise floor with 140 Hz/g scale factor and ±20 g full scale. The overall power consumption of the accelerometer is 3.5 mW under a 1.5 V supply.},

pages={1336-1350}, 
abstract={By employing two passive-mixer-based downconversion paths, a recently proposed noise cancelling receiver achieves a low-noise figure and tolerates most out-of-band blockers up to 0 dBm with little performance degradation. However, like most wideband passive-mixer-based designs, the architecture is far less tolerant of harmonic blockers, that is blockers located at or around precise integer multiples of the LO frequency. These blockers are problematic because they are downconverted inside the bandwidth of the baseband TIAs and, so, experience significant on-chip voltage gain. This work presents an enhanced noise-cancelling architecture that prevents harmonic blockers experiencing large on-chip gain, thereby boosting the receiver's resilience to such blockers. It will be shown that separate techniques are required for the voltage-driven main path and the current-driven auxiliary path. To validated these ideas, single-ended and fully-differential prototypes were fabricated in 28 nm silicon.},

It senses a frequency span of 1 GHz ranging from 2.7 to 3.7 GHz (PCAST Band) with a resolution bandwidth of 20 MHz in 4.4 μs, 50 times faster than traditional sweeping spectrum scanners. Rapid interferer detector with the bandpass QAIC is two orders of magnitude more energy efficient than traditional Nyquist-rate architectures and one order of magnitude more energy efficient than existing low-pass CS methods. Thanks to CS, the aggregate sampling rate of the QAIC interferer detector is compressed by 6.3 × compared to traditional Nyquist-rate architectures for the same instantaneous bandwidth.},

abstract={An 8.2 Gb/s-to-10.3 Gb/s full-rate referenceless CDR in 0.18 μm CMOS is presented. By realizing an asymmetric phase detector transfer curve, the linear CDR's “single-sided” capture range increases, which allows the Hogge phase detector itself to function as a frequency detector, thus eliminating the need for the reference clock and the separate frequency detector in conventional dual-loop CDRs. Robust frequency and phase acquisition is demonstrated. Furthermore, a new phase adjustment mode is added to further improve the jitter tolerance performance. The measurement results show that with a 10.3 Gb/s 2 31-1 PRBS input, the random jitter at the output data is 0.336 ps rms, and the out-of-band jitter tolerance is 0.34 UI p-p.},

abstract={A charge pump using 0.13- μm CMOS process for low-voltage energy harvesting is presented. A low-power adaptive dead-time (AD) circuit is used which automatically optimizes the dead-time according to the input voltage. A negative charge pump is also utilized for high efficiency at low input voltages (VIN). The AD circuit improves efficiency by 17% at VIN of 0.2 V compared to the fixed dead time circuit as well as enables the charge pump to work at VIN down to 0.15 V. Dynamic body bias (DBB) and switch-conductance enhancement techniques are applied to a unit stage of the three-stage charge pump. The reverse current flowing through the cross-coupled NMOS switches is prevented and the current transfer is also maximized. Together with the AD circuit and the DBB technique, the maximum output current was improved by 240% as compared to the conventional charge pump design using only the forward body bias.},

abstract={A low-jitter, low-power LC-based injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) with a digital frequency-tracking loop (FTL) is presented. Based on a pulse gating technique, the proposed FTL continuously tunes the oscillator's free-running frequency to ensure robust operation across PVT variations. The FTL resolves the race condition existing in injection-locked PLLs by decoupling frequency tuning from the injection path, such that the phase-locking condition is only determined by the injection path. This paper also introduces an accurate theoretical large-signal analysis for phase domain response (PDR) of injection-locked oscillators (ILOs). The proposed PDR analysis captures the asymmetric nature of ILO's lock-in range, and the impact of frequency error on injection strength and phase noise performance. The proposed architecture and analysis are demonstrated by a prototype fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process with active area of 0.25 mm2. The prototype ILCM generates output clock in the range of 6.75-8.25 GHz by multiplying the reference clock by 64. It achieves superior integrated jitter performance of 190 fsrms, while consuming 2.25 mW power. This translates to an excellent figure-of-merit (FoM) of -251 dB, which is the best reported high-frequency clock multiplier.},

abstract={Thin-film MEMS resonators fabricated at low temperatures can be processed on CMOS ICs, forming high-sensitivity transducers within complete sensing systems. A key focus for the MEMS devices is increasing the resonant frequency, enabling, among other benefits, operation at atmospheric pressure. However, at increased frequencies, parasitics associated with both the MEMS-CMOS interfaces and the MEMS device itself can severely degrade the detectability of the resonant peak. This work attempts to overcome these parasitics while providing isolation of the CMOS IC from potentially damaging sensing environments. To achieve this, an interfacing approach is proposed based on capacitive coupling across the CMOS IC passivation, and a detection approach is proposed based on synchronous readout. Results are presented from a prototype system, integrating a custom CMOS IC with MEMS bridge resonators. With the MEMS resonators fabricated in-house at 175°C on a separate substrate, readout results with multiple different resonators are obtained. In all cases, the IC enables detection with >20 dB SNR of resonant peaks that are only weakly detectable or undetectable directly using a vector-network analyzer (VNA).},

pages={1550-1559}, 
abstract={For area reasons, NMOS transistors are preferred over PMOS for the pull-up path in gate drivers. Bootstrapping has to ensure sufficient NMOS gate overdrive. Especially in high-current gate drivers with large transistors, the bootstrap capacitor is too large for integration. This paper proposes three options of fully integrated bootstrap circuits. The key idea is that the main bootstrap capacitor is supported by a second bootstrap capacitor, which is charged to a higher voltage and ensures high charge allocation when the driver turns on. A capacitor sizing guideline and the overall driver implementation including a suitable charge pump for permanent driver activation is provided. A linear regulator is used for bootstrap supply and it also compensates the voltage drop of the bootstrap diode. Measurements from a testchip in 180 nm high-voltage BiCMOS confirm the benefit of high-voltage charge storing. The fully integrated bootstrap circuit with two stacked 75.8 pF and 18.9 pF capacitors results in an expected voltage dip of lower than 1 V. Both bootstrap capacitors require 70% less area compared to a conventional bootstrap circuit. Besides drivers, the proposed bootstrap can also be directly applied to power stages to achieve fully integrated switched mode power supplies or class-D output stages.},

abstract={Variation in process, voltage and temperature is a major obstacle in achieving energy-efficient operation of LSI. This paper proposes an all-digital on-chip circuit to monitor leakage current variations of both of the nMOSFET and pMOSFET independently. As leakage current is highly sensitive to threshold voltage and temperature, the circuit is suitable for tracking process and temperature variation. The circuit uses reconfigurable inhomogeneity to obtain statistical properties from a single monitor instance. A compact reconfigurable inverter topology is proposed to implement the monitor circuit. The compact and digital nature of the inverter enables cell-based design, which will reduce design costs. Measurement results from a 65 nm test chip show the validity of the proposed circuit. For a 124 sample size for both of the nMOSFET and pMOSFET, the monitor area is 4500 μm2 and active power consumption is 76 nW at 0.8 V operation. The proposed technique enables area-efficient and low-cost implementation thus can be used in product chips for applications such as dynamic energy and thermal management, testing and post-silicon tuning.},

abstract={Dynamic polarization control (DPC) is the method of setting the polarization of the far-field electric field generated by a radiating antenna entirely electronically in order to maintain polarization matching with the receiving antenna regardless of its polarization or orientation in space. This work implements a fully integrated 2 × 1 phased array radiator in 32 nm CMOS SOI at 105.5 GHz with DPC. The system consists of a central locking oscillator that phase locks oscillators within the core of each antenna followed by three amplification stages with variable gain that drive the antennas. By controlling the amplitude and phase of two orthogonal polarized subparts of each multi-port antenna, various far-field polarizations can be realized. The array is capable of beam steering, controlling the polarization angle across the entire tuning range of 0° to 180° while maintaining axial ratios above 10 dB, and controlling the axial ratio from 2.4 dB (near circular) to 14 dB (linear) in various directions of radiation. It radiates a maximum EIRP of 7.8 dBm with a total radiated power of 0.9 mW. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work presents the first integrated radiator with dynamically controllable polarization.},

abstract={A first proof-of-concept mm-sized implantable device using ultrasonic power transfer and a hybrid bi-directional data communication link is presented. Ultrasonic power transfer enables miniaturization of the implant and operation deep inside the body, while still achieving safe and high power levels (100 μW to a few mWs) required for most implant applications. The current implant prototype measures 4 mm ×7.8 mm and is comprised of a piezoelectric receiver, an IC designed in 65 nm CMOS process and an off-chip antenna. The IC can support a maximum DC load of 100 μW for an incident acoustic intensity that is ~ 5% of the FDA diagnostic limit. This demonstrates the feasibility of providing further higher available DC power, potentially opening up new implant applications. The proposed hybrid bi-directional data link consists of ultrasonic downlink and RF uplink. Falling edge of the ultrasound input is detected as downlink data. The implant transmits an ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse sequence as uplink data, demonstrating capability of implementing an energy-efficient M-ary PPM transmitter in the future.},

abstract={This paper presents a multi-phase sub-harmonic injection locking technique. This technique can significantly increase the locking range of a multi-phase injection locking oscillator compared to the conventional single-phase injection locking scheme. By application of this technique, a scalable “active frequency multiplier” chain architecture is proposed, which can generate THz signal from a low mm-wave frequency or RF reference source. We also propose a multi-ring system topology to implement this frequency multiplier scheme. As proof of concept, a cascaded 3-stage 3-phase 2nd-order sub-harmonic injection locking oscillator chain is implemented in the IBM9HP SiGe BiCMOS process with its fT/fmax of 300/350 GHz. The design achieves a maximum output power of -16.6 dBm at 498GHz, a phase noise of -87 dBc/ Hz at 1 MHz offset, and a total 5.1% frequency tuning range from 485.1 GHz to 510.7 GHz, which is the largest frequency tuning range among all the reported silicon-based THz oscillator sources in the 0.5 THz band.},

abstract={A compact decision-error-tolerant 2b/cycle SAR ADC architecture is presented. Two DACs with different designated functions, SIG-DAC and REF-DAC, are implemented to make the structure compact and to eliminate the sampling skew issue. Use of a nonbinary decision scheme with decision redundancies not only increases the ADC speed with a relaxed DAC settling requirement but also makes the performance robust to reference fluctuations and comparator offset variations. The proposed dynamic register and direct DAC control scheme enhance the conversion speed by minimizing logic delay in the SAR decision loop. The proposed comparator-error detection with digital error correction scheme enhances high-speed ADC performance. A prototype 7b ADC fabricated in a 45 nm CMOS process operates at a sampling rate of 1 GS/s under a 1.25 V supply while achieving a peak SNDR of 41.6 dB and maintaining an ENOB higher than 6 up to 1.3 GHz signal frequency. The FoM under a 1.25 V supply is an 80 fJ/conversion-step with a power consumption of 7.2 mW.},

pages={786-798}, 
abstract={The objective of Selective Change Driven (SCD) Vision is to capture and process those scene pixels that have the greatest impact in the motion estimation task. The implemented SCD Vision sensor delivers the pixels ordered according to the illumination change undergone by each pixel, from the last time each pixel was read-out. This ordering strategy is especially interesting for motion detection algorithms, since it allows for a reduction in data bandwidth requirements without decreasing accuracy. The speed of the obtained pixel flow allows movement detection and tracking at a speed several orders of magnitude higher than conventional vision systems. To accomplish these objectives, the sensor is based on a well-known logarithm continuous time cell for light capture, and a new high-speed several thousand input Winner-Take-All (WTA) circuit with single winner selection. This WTA circuit differentiates this sensor from others, since it allows for a constant synchronous pixel rate, self-adaptation to scene conditions, the operation being controlled by the processing hardware, the complete use of the available processing and bandwidth resources, and illumination and address event delivery at the same time resolution of 2 μs. A 64 × 64 SCD Vision sensor is presented which has been implemented in standard 180 nm CMOS.},

abstract={Intensive pixel shading dominates the power dissipation of the graphics pipeline as the screen resolution grows. In this work, we propose a 130.3 mW 16-core mobile GPU with three pixel approximation techniques and a corresponding tile-based rasterization architecture. The proposed architecture can trade-off between power consumption and visual quality to provide power-aware capability, and is fabricated with TSMC 45 nm technology. The feasibility and effectiveness of these techniques are verified in this chip prototype. The implementation results show that, with satisfactory visual quality, 52.32% of the power consumption of the shader processors can be empirically reduced with an experimental Approximated Precision Shader architecture and a Screen-space Approximated Lighting technique. Furthermore, the Approximated Texturing technique can reduce 24.57% of L1 cache updates in our evaluation.},

pages={1974-1987}, 
abstract={This paper presents a dual-mode Doherty long-term evolution (LTE) power amplifier (PA) for efficiency enhancement at power back-off. The amplifier utilizes transformer-based Doherty operation to achieve high back-off efficiency with good linearity. In addition, the PA has two power modes to further reduce the power consumption when low output power is required. The PA combines four push-pull amplifiers by using an symmetrical hybrid transformer that ensures low combining loss and high amplifier efficiency. The two-stage LTE amplifier is fabricated in standard 40 nm CMOS technology and it achieves 28 dBm output power with 1.5 V supply. The peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of the amplifier is 34% and the PAE at 6 dB and 12 dB back-off levels are still as high as 25.5% and 19.7% respectively. The amplifier is tested with 20 MHz LTE signal and it satisfies the stringent ACLR and EVM requirements at 23.4 dBm output power with a PAE of 23.3%. In addition, the amplifier achieves 18.4% PAE when 6 dB lower power is transmitted and 11.1% PAE at 12 dB back-off under LTE modulation.},

The impact of process variations, voltage and temperature on the energy-quality tradeoff is investigated.

abstract={A scalable all-digital power supply noise analyzer with 20 GHz sampling bandwidth and 1 mV resolution is demonstrated in 32 nm CMOS technology for enabling low-cost low-power in-situ power supply noise measurements without dedicated clean supplies and clock sources. This subsampled averaging-based analyzer measures power supply noise in both the equivalent-time and frequency domains with low-resolution VCO-based ADCs. For equivalent-time measurements, the accurate impedance characterization of power delivery networks is simply done by measuring a clock-synchronized current-step response. For frequency-domain measurements, the digital random phase-noise accumulation technique is analyzed and verified to overcome the clock-and-noise correlation issue in autocorrelation measurements. In general large scale integrated circuits and systems, the entire power supply noise analyzer consumes negligible active and leakage powers because of the MHz-range sampling clock frequency and fully digital implementation with only hundreds of logic gates.},

abstract={A fully integrated wideband active duplexing transceiver with baseband noise-cancelling duplexing LNAs is presented. The circuit allows in-band full duplex operation with concurrent reception and transmission in the same band or closely-spaced channels. A passive mixer-first architecture is applied here, sharing a single passive mixer to perform simultaneous up-conversion and down-conversion. The bi-directional transparency of the passive mixer allows the duplexing function to be implemented at baseband instead of RF front end. Under the same condition as required for noise cancellation, the baseband duplexing LNAs buffer the transmitter input signals to the mixer while canceling those signals in receive path. Measurements from the transceiver implemented in 65 nm CMOS show a frequency tuning range of 0.1-1.5 GHz with 20 dB, NF as low as 5.5 dB and transmitted power up to -7.1 dBm. A 30 dB linear isolation between receive and transmit is generally maintained across both LO frequency and in-band transmit/receive frequency separation. Significant suppression of transmit-induced noise and nonlinear intermodulation between received and transmitted signals are also achieved.},

abstract={This paper presents a 22 to 26.5 Gb/s optical receiver with an all-digital clock and data recovery (AD-CDR) fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. The receiver consists of an optical front-end and a half-rate bang-bang clock and data recovery circuit. The optical front-end achieves low power consumption by using inverter-based amplifiers and realizes sufficient bandwidth by applying several bandwidth extension techniques. In addition, in order to minimize additional jitter at the front-end, not only magnitude and bandwidth but also group-delay responses are considered. The AD-CDR employs an LC quadrature digitally controlled oscillator (LC-QDCO) to achieve a high phase noise figure-of-merit at tens of gigahertz. The recovered clock jitter is 1.28 ps rms and the measured jitter tolerance exceeds the tolerance mask specified in IEEE 802.3ba. The receiver sensitivity is 106 and 184 for a bit error rate of 10-12 at data rates of 25 and 26.5 Gb/s, respectively. The entire receiver chip occupies an active die area of 0.75 mm2 and consumes 254 mW at a data rate of 26.5 Gb/s. The energy efficiencies of the front-end and entire receiver at 26.5 Gb/s are 1.35 and 9.58 pJ/bit, respectively.},

abstract={An ideal infinite impulse response (IIR) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) can have an effect on wireline received waveforms similar to a continuous-time equalizer, but without the associated amplification of noise and crosstalk. However, an IIR DFE's performance degrades significantly as the feedback loop delay increases. Fortunately, adding a single discrete-time tap can eliminate the degradation. The implementation of a half-rate DFE with two IIR taps and one discrete-time tap is presented here. The two IIR filters have different time constants to accommodate a variety of channel pulse responses having a long tail. The discrete-time tap cancels the first post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) term and alleviates feedback loop timing issues. The DFE can receive data transmitted with a low swing of 150 mVpp-diff through 24 dB of channel loss at half the bitrate while consuming 4.1 mW at 10 Gb/s. Digital foreground calibration of clock phase shifters and offset cancellation is described. The receiver, including the DFE, clock buffers and clock phase adjustment, occupies an area of 8760 μm 2 in an ST 28 nm LP CMOS process.},

abstract={This paper proposes a half-rate single-loop reference-less binary CDR that operates from 8.5 Gb/s to 12.1 Gb/s (36% capture range). The high capture range is made possible by adding a novel frequency detection mechanism which limits the magnitude of the phase error between the input data and the VCO clock. The proposed frequency detector produces three phases of the data, and feeds into the phase detector the data phase that minimizes the CDR phase error. This frequency detector, implemented within a 10 Gb/s CDR in Fujitsu's 65 nm CMOS, consumes 11 mW and improves the capture range by up to 6 × when it is activated.},

year={2015}, 
volume={50},

pages={1988-2001}, 
abstract={This paper reports a switched-capacitor (SC)-buffer Biquad that can be recycled efficiently as an ultra-compact low-pass filter (LPF) in nanoscale CMOS. It incorporates only passive-SC networks and open-loop unity-gain buffers; both are friendlier to technology downscaling than most conventional Biquads that use high-gain amplifiers and closed-loop negative feedback. Complex-pole pairs with independent Q factors are recursively realized in one clock period, while ensuring low crosstalk effect between the formations of each pole. Nonlinearity and parasitic effects are inherently low due to no internal gain. The fabricated 65 nm CMOS prototype is a 1x-recycling SC-buffer Biquad that is equivalent to a 4th-order Butterworth LPF with 75% buffer utilization. It occupies a die size of only 0.02 mm2 and exhibits 20x bandwidth tunability (0.5 to 10 MHz), linear with the clock rate. At 10 MHz bandwidth, the in-band IIP3 is +17.6 dBm and input-referred noise is 19.5 nV/ √Hz; they correspond to 59.2 dB SFDR and 0.013 fJ figure-of-merit which are favorably comparable with the recent art. The 1 dB compression point (P1dB) conforms to the out-of-band blocker profile of the LTE standard at a 20 dB front-end gain.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a push towards high-density and monolithic DC-DC converters to support applications such as performance and mobile computing, consumer electronics, and renewable energy. Switched capacitor (SC) converters have started to gain traction for a number of these applications, but are still subject to fundamental limitations that drive them towards expensive process options and high switching frequencies. Variable regulation is challenging with the SC approach, and comes at the cost of lower power density and efficiency. This work presents a resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) topology that addresses some of these challenges by introducing a small amount of inductance in series with the flying capacitor, eliminating charge-sharing losses and thus allowing efficient operation in a low-cost process option. The three-phase interleaved topology can deliver up to 7.7 W at 85% efficiency (power density of 0.91 W/mm 2 or 6.4 kW/in 3) using a bootstrapped n-channel power train and single-digit nH inductors embedded in a flip-chip assembly. We also present the first implementation of efficient, fully-variable conversion ratios in a silicon ReSC integrated circuit without reconfiguration or gain-hopping .},

abstract={This paper describes a 0.5-16.3 Gb/s fully adaptive wireline transceiver embedded in 20 nm CMOS FPGA. The receiver utilizes bandwidth adjustable CTLE and adjustable output capacitance at the AGC to support wide range of channel loss profiles. A modified 11-tap, 1 bit speculative DFE topology provides reliable operation across all data rates. Low-latency digital CDR ensures high tracking bandwidth while still providing flexibility to support multiple protocols. The transceiver uses ring-oscillator with programmable main and cross-coupled inverter drive-strengths to wide range of operating frequency for low data-rate operation. A wide range low jitter LC-PLL utilizes feedback divider with synchronized CMOS down-counter without a prescaler to achieve a continuous divide ratio of 16-257. The clock distribution uses quadrature-error correction circuit to improve phase interpolator linearity. The transceiver achieves BER <;10-15 over a 28 dB loss backplane at 16.3 Gb/s and over legacy channels with 10 G-KR characteristics at 10.3125 Gb/s. The transceiver meets jitter tolerance specifications for both PCIe Gen3 at 8 Gb/s and PCIe Gen4 at 16 Gb/s in both common-clock and spread-spectrum modes.},

abstract={A 12 bit Dual-Rate Hybrid digital-to-analog converter (DAC) architecture with a split Nyquist (1 GS/s) and delta-sigma modulator path (8 GS/s) is proposed and implemented in 65 nm CMOS. Based on the hybrid architecture, the delta-sigma-assisted pre-distortion scheme compensates for the current steering cell mismatch, which further reduces the analog circuit complexity and area. The proposed 8X unrolled pipeline delta-sigma modulator allows for high-speed third-order noise shaping with a digital standard cell design flow. The measured spurious-free dynamic range achieves 91-76 dB over the 500 MHz Nyquist band. The proposed DAC architecture is mostly digital and hence favors future technology scaling.},

abstract={A 1 × 400 array of backside-illuminated SPADs fabricated in 130 nm 3D IC CMOS technology is presented. Sensing is performed in the top tier substrate and time-to-digital conversion in the bottom tier. Clusters of eight pixels are connected to a winner-take-all circuit with collision detection capabilities to realise an efficient sharing of the time-to-digital converter (TDC). The sensor's 100 TDCs are based on a dual-frequency architecture enabling 30 pJ per conversion at a rate of 13.3 ms/s per TDC. The resolution (1 LSB) of the TDCs is 49.7 ps with a standard deviation of 0.8 ps across the entire array; the mean DNL is ±0.44 LSB and the mean INL is ±0.47.

abstract={A digital-to-time converter (DTC) controls time delay by a digital code, which is useful, for example, in a sampling oscilloscope, fractional-N PLL, or time-interleaved ADC. This paper proposes constant-slope charging as a method to realize a DTC with intrinsically better integral non-linearity (INL) compared to the popular variable-slope method. The proposed DTC chip realized in 65 nm CMOS consists of a voltage-controlled variable-delay element (DTC-core) driven by a 10 bit digital-to-analog converter. Measurements with a 55 MHz crystal clock demonstrate a full-scale delay programmable from 19 ps to 189 ps with a resolution from 19 fs to 185 fs. As available oscilloscopes are not good enough to reliably measure such high timing resolution, a frequency-domain method has been developed that modulates a DTC edge and derives INL from spur strength. An INL of 0.17% at 189 ps full-scale delay and 0.34% at 19 ps are measured, representing 8-9 bit effective INL-limited resolution. Output rms jitter is better than 210 fs limited by the test setup, while the DTC consumes 1.8 mW.},

abstract={A system-on-chip for an invisible, fully-implantable cochlear implant is presented. Implantable acoustic sensing is achieved by interfacing the SoC to a piezoelectric sensor that detects the sound-induced motion of the middle ear. Measurements from human cadaveric ears demonstrate that the sensor can detect sounds between 40 and 90 dB SPL over the speech bandwidth. A highly-reconfigurable digital sound processor enables system power scalability by reconfiguring the number of channels, and provides programmable features to enable a patient-specific fit. A mixed-signal arbitrary waveform neural stimulator enables energy-optimal stimulation pulses to be delivered to the auditory nerve. The energy-optimal waveform is validated with in-vivo measurements from four human subjects which show a 15% to 35% energy saving over the conventional rectangular waveform. Prototyped in a 0.18 μm high-voltage CMOS technology, the SoC in 8-channel mode consumes 572 μW of power including stimulation. The SoC integrates implantable acoustic sensing, sound processing, and neural stimulation on one chip to minimize the implant size, and proof-of-concept is demonstrated with measurements from a human cadaver ear.},

abstract={Non-linear voltage-to-frequency characteristic of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) severely curtails the dynamic range of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) built with VCOs. Typical approaches to enhance the dynamic range include embedding the VCO-based ADC in a ΔΣ loop or to post-process the digital data for calibration, both of which impose significant power constraints. In contrast, in this work the VCO-based ADC is linearized through a filtered dithering technique, wherein the VCO-based ADC is used as a fine stage that processes the residue from a coarse stage in a 0-1 MASH structure. The proposed filtered dithering technique conditions the signal to the VCO input to appear as white noise thereby eliminating spurious signal content arising out of the VCO nonlinearity. The work resorts to multiple other signal processing techniques to build a high-resolution, wideband prototype, in 65 nm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), that achieves 10 effective number of bits (ENOB) in digitizing signals with 50 MHz bandwidth consuming 8.2 mW at a figure of merit (FoM) of 90 fJ/conv.step.},

pages={693-703}, 
abstract={At low-GHz frequencies, analog time-delay cells realized by LC delay lines or transmission lines are unpractical in CMOS, due to their large size. As an alternative, delays can be approximated by all-pass filters exploiting transconductors and capacitors (g m -C filters). This paper presents an easily cascadable compact g m -C all-pass filter cell for 1-2.5 GHz. Compared to previous g m -RC and g m -C filter cells, it achieves at least 5x larger frequency range for the same relative delay variation, while keeping gain variation within 1 dB. This paper derives design equations for the transfer function and several non-idealities. Circuit techniques to improve phase linearity and reduce delay variation over frequency, are also proposed. A 160 nm CMOS chip with maximum delay of 550 ps is demonstrated with monotonous delay steps of 13 ps (41 steps) and an RMS delay variation error of less than 10 ps over more than an octave in frequency (1-2.5 GHz). The delay per area is at least 50x more than for earlier chips. The all-pass cells are used to realize a four element timed-array receiver IC. Measurement results of the beam pattern demonstrate the wideband operation capability of the g m -RC time delay cell and timed-array IC-architecture.},

pages={2678-2691}, 
abstract={Although multiplying delay-locked loops allow clock frequency multiplication with very low phase noise and jitter, their application has been so far limited to integer-N multiplication, and the achieved reference-spur performance has been typically limited by time offsets. This paper presents the first published multiplying delay-locked loop achieving fine fractional-N frequency resolution, and introduces an automatic cancellation of the phase detector offset. Both capabilities are enabled by insertion of a digital-to-time converter in the reference path. The proposed synthesizer, implemented in a standard 65 nm CMOS process, occupies a core area of 0.09 mm 2, and generates a frequency ranging between 1.6 and 1.9 GHz with a 190 Hz resolution from a 50 MHz quartz-based reference oscillator. In fractional-N mode, the integrated RMS jitter, including random and deterministic components, is below 1.4 ps at 3 mW power consumption, leading to a jitter-power figure of merit of -232 dB. In integer-N mode, the circuit achieves RMS jitter of 0.47 ps at 2.4 mW power and figure of merit of -243 dB. Thanks to the adoption of the automatic offset cancellation, the reference-spur level is reduced from -32 to -55 dBc.},

abstract={Software-defined radio receivers increasingly exploit linear RF V-I conversion, instead of RF voltage gain, to improve interference robustness. Unfortunately, the linearity of CMOS inverters, which are often used to implement V-I conversion, is highly sensitive to Process, Voltage and Temperature variations. This paper proposes a more robust technique based on resistive degeneration. To mitigate third-order IM3 distortion induced by the quadratic MOSFET I-V characteristic, a new linearization technique is proposed which exploits a floating battery by-pass circuit and replica biasing to improve IIP3 in a robust way. This paper explains the concept and analyzes linearity improvement. To demonstrate operation, an LNTA with current domain mixer is implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process. Compared to a conventional inverter based LNTA with the same transconductance, it improves IIP3 from 2 dBm to a robust P IIP3 of 8 dBm at the cost of 67% increase in power consumption.},

title={High Frequency Buck Converter Design Using Time-Based Control Techniques}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={50},

pages={990-1001}, 
abstract={Time-based control techniques for the design of high switching frequency buck converters are presented. Using time as the processing variable, the proposed controller operates with CMOS-level digital-like signals but without adding any quantization error. A ring oscillator is used as an integrator in place of conventional opamp-RC or G m-C integrators while a delay line is used to perform voltage to time conversion and to sum time signals. A simple flip-flop generates pulse-width modulated signal from the time-based output of the controller. Hence time-based control eliminates the need for wide bandwidth error amplifier, pulse-width modulator (PWM) in analog controllers or high resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital PWM in digital controllers. As a result, it can be implemented in small area and with minimal power. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process, the prototype buck converter occupies an active area of 0.24 mm2, of which the controller occupies only 0.0375 mm2. It operates over a wide range of switching frequencies (10-25 MHz) and regulates output to any desired voltage in the range of 0.6 V to 1.5 V with 1.8 V input voltage. With a 500 mA step in the load current, the settling time is less than 3.5 μs and the measured reference tracking bandwidth is about 1 MHz. Better than 94% peak efficiency is achieved while consuming a quiescent current of only 2 μA/MHz.},

abstract={A marker-less camera pose estimation engine (CPEE) with reconfigurable logarithmic SIMD processor is proposed for the view angle estimation used in mobile augmented reality (AR) applications. Compared to previous marker-based approach, marker-less camera pose estimation can overlay virtual images directly on natural world without the help of markers. However, they require 150× larger computing costs and large power consuming floating-point operations where such requirement severely restricts real-time operations and low-power implementations in mobile platform, respectively. To overcome the gap in computational costs between marker-based and marker-less method, speculative execution (SE) and reconfigurable data-arrangement layer (RDL) are proposed to reduce computing time by 17% and 27%, respectively. For low-power implementation of floating-point units, logarithmic processing element (LPE) is designed to reduce overall power consumption by 18%.

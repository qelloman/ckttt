abstract={A low-power real-time traffic sign recognition system that is robust under various illumination conditions is proposed. It is composed of a Retinex preprocessor and an SVM processor. The Retinex preprocessor performs the Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) algorithm for robust light and dark adaptation under harsh illumination environments. In the Retinex preprocessor, the recursive Gaussian engine (RGE) and reflectance engine (RE) exploit parallelism of the MSR tasks with a two-stage pipeline, and a mixed-mode scale generator (SG) with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) performs parameter optimizations for various scene conditions. The SVM processor performs the SVM algorithm for robust traffic sign classification. The proposed algorithm-optimized small-sized kernel cache and memory controller reduce power consumption and memory redundancy by 78% and 35%, respectively. The proposed system is implemented as two separated ICs in a 0.13-μm CMOS process, and the two chips are connected using network-on-chip off-chip gateway. The system achieves robust sign recognition operation with 90% sign recognition accuracy under harsh illumination conditions while consuming just 92 mW at 1.2 V.},

abstract={This work proposes a novel resistor-floating-resistor-string digital-to-analog converter (RFR-DAC) architecture with a 10-bit resolution for liquid crystal display (LCD) driver applications. The proposed architecture improves the linearity of DAC, unifies its channel performance, and achieves a 10-bit resolution with a compact die size smaller than those of the state-of-the-art 10-bit DACs. The proposed RFR-DAC combines a 6-bit RDAC and a 4-bit FR-DAC (floating-resistor-string DAC) to offer unique two-voltage-selection and one-voltage-selection schemes without the need of unity-gain buffers to isolate parallel-connected resistor strings. A stacked floating class-AB control is also devised to bias the last output buffer stage. The 10-bit RFR-DAC prototypes are implemented using 0.35-μm/0.5-μm CMOS technology with the worst DNL/INL = 0.11/0.92 LSB via a two-voltage-selection scheme; and 1.37/1.45 LSB via a one-voltage-selection scheme.},

abstract={This paper presents a W-band 2 × 2 focal-plane array (FPA) for passive millimeter-wave imaging in a standard 0.18 μm SiGe BiCMOS process (fT/fmax = 200/180 GHz). The FPA incorporates four Dicke-type receivers representing four imaging pixels. Each receiver employs the direct-conversion architecture consisting of an on-chip slot folded dipole antenna, an SPDT switch, a low noise amplifier, a single-balanced mixer, an injection-locked frequency tripler (ILFT), an IF variable gain amplifier, a power detector, an active bandpass filter and a synchronous demodulator. The LO signal is generated by a shared Ka-band PLL and distributed symmetrically to four local ILFTs. The measured LO phase noise is -93 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from the 96 GHz carrier. This imaging receiver (without antenna) achieves a measured average responsivity and noise equivalent power of 285 MV/W and 8.1 fW/Hz1/2, respectively, across the 86-106 GHz bandwidth, which results a calculated NETD of 0.48 K with a 30 ms integration time. The system NETD increases to 3 K with on-chip antenna due to its low efficiency at W-band. MMW images have been generated in transmission mode. This work demonstrates the highest integration level of any silicon-based systems in the 94 GHz imaging band.},

abstract={A new technique is proposed for the design of linear power amplifiers at millimeter-wave frequencies where load-pull of large transistor output cells is difficult. The technique transforms the load-pull data on a small, standard foundry transistor layout to a pair of common-gate contours for the intrinsic device; one source-gate and one drain-gate. These are recombined as an intrinsic drain-source contour for a larger and arbitrary transistor layout. A Q-band driver amplifier for the ETSI 42-GHz point-to-point radio band has been designed using the proposed technique. The fabricated MMIC consumes 1 W and has a gain of 21 dB, with OIP3 of 35 dBm, OIP5 of 28 dBm and P1 dB of 23 dBm. The PAE is approximately 19%. The OIP3 to P1 dB and OIP3 to dc power ratios are believed to be the best reported to date.},

abstract={An improved architecture of polar transmitter (TX) is presented. The proposed architecture is digitally-intensive and mainly composed of an all-digital PLL (ADPLL) for phase modulation, a 1-bit low-pass delta sigma ΔΣ modulator for envelop modulation, and a H-bridge class-D power amplifier (PA) for differential signaling. The ΔΣ modulator is clocked using the phase modulated RF carrier to ensure phase synchronization between the amplitude and phase path, and to guarantee the PA is switching at zero crossings of the output current. An on-chip pre-filter is used to reduce the parasitic capacitance from packages at the switch stage output. The high over sampling ratio of the ΔΣ modulator move quantization noise far away from the carrier frequency, ensuring good in-band performance and relax filter requirements. The on-chip filter also acts as impedance matching and differential to single-ended conversion. The measured digital transmitter consumes 58 mW from a 1-V supply at 6.8 dBm output power.},

title={Digitally Calibrated 768-kS/s 10-b Minimum-Size SAR ADC Array With Dithering}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2129-2140}, 
abstract={Array sensors require a high-performance analog-to-digital converter (ADC) array with small area and low power. Successive-approximation register (SAR) ADC has good potential for ADC array due to its simple analog circuits. However, SAR ADCs with 10-b resolution and higher normally need a large capacitor array due to the stringent matching requirement. The large capacitor array also limits the ADC dynamic performance. The capacitor mismatch has been compensated by analog calibration techniques. In this work, a novel digital calibration method is developed for SAR ADC based on dithering. With dithering, weights of most significant bit (MSB) capacitors can be measured accurately so that very small capacitors can be used in the SAR ADC due to the relaxed matching requirement. A modified bit-cycling procedure is developed to avoid the code gaps caused by capacitor dithering. This calibration technique requires no analog calibration overhead and simple digital decoders. The technique is implemented in an ADC array design including 256 SAR ADCs for a high-speed CMOS imaging sensor in a 0.18-μm CMOS process. The 10-b SAR ADC is designed with the minimum capacitor array size in the process. A single SAR ADC only occupies 15 μm × 710 μm. Sampling at 768 kS/s, peak DNL and peak INL of the original ADCs averaged across the array are 0.82 least significant bit (LSB) and 3.85 LSB, respectively. For a signal close to the Nyquist frequency, original ADCs have 7.96-b average ENOB. After calibration with dithering, ADCs have 0.55-LSB peak DNL and 0.77-LSB peak INL averaged across the array. The average ENOB improves to 9.83 b. Compared with the benchmark 10-b SAR ADCs, this design is the most area-efficient design. In this work, the calibration decoders are implemented off-chip. With a sample-and-hold amplifier, the calibration method can run in the background.},

abstract={In this paper, a CMOS on-chip sensor is presented to detect dielectric constant of organic chemicals. The dielectric constant of these chemicals is measured using the oscillation frequency shift of an LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) upon the change of the tank capacitance when exposed to the liquid. To make the system self-sustained, the VCO is embedded inside a frequency synthesizer to convert the frequency shift into voltage that can be digitized using an on-chip analog-to-digital converter. The dielectric constant is then estimated using a detection procedure including the calibration of the sensor. The dielectric constants of different organic liquids have been detected in the frequency range of 7-9 GHz with an accuracy of 3.7% compared with theoretical values for sample volumes of 10-20 μL. The sensor is also applicable for binary mixture detection and estimation of the fractional volume of the constituting materials with an accuracy of 1%-2%.},

abstract={Implementing serial I/O receivers based on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal post-processing has drawn growing interest with technology scaling, but power consumption remains among the key issues for such digital receiver in high speed applications.

The combination compensates for both the frontend non-ideality and the channel response while maintaining low ADC resolution and hence enables low power consumption.

abstract={We present a 2.4-GHz asymmetric multilevel outphasing (AMO) power amplifier (PA) with class-E branch amplifiers and discrete supply modulators integrated in a 65-nm CMOS process. AMO PAs achieve improved modulation bandwidth and efficiency over envelope tracking (ET) PAs by replacing the continuous supply modulator with a discrete supply modulator implemented with a fast digital switching network. Outphasing modulation is used to provide the required fine output envelope control. The AMO PA delivers 27.7-dBm peak output power with 45% system efficiency at 2.4 GHz.

abstract={This paper presents a spurious-free switching buck converter with enhanced light-load efficiency for use in noise-sensitive portable electronics. The proposed switching buck converter achieves low output noise by using a delta-sigma-modulator (ΔΣ) controller. Its light-load efficiency is enhanced by: 1) scaling the switching frequency of the buck converter (i.e., the sampling frequency of its ΔΣ-modulator controller) with the load current; 2) switching its operation from continuous conduction mode (CCM) to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) at light loads; and 3) using a new low-power current-sensing circuit. The ΔΣ modulator is designed with an input-feedforward architecture, which enables the switching frequency of the controller to be scaled without disturbing the stability of the feedback loop of the buck converter, and also reduces the controller quiescent current. The proposed switching buck converter was fabricated in 0.13-μm digital CMOS. Measurements results demonstrate that this buck converter achieves a spurious-free output with a noise floor below -60 dBm and voltage ripples below 70 mV over its full loading range (2 mA to 800 mA). Furthermore, it achieves a power efficiency higher than 70% over this entire range, with a peak efficiency of 95.1%.},

title={A 20-b $pm$ 40-mV Range Read-Out IC With 50-nV Offset and 0.04% Gain Error for Bridge Transducers}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2152-2163}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 20-b read-out IC with ±40-mV full-scale range that is intended for use with bridge transducers. It consists of a current-feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) followed by a switched-capacitor incremental ΔΣ ADC. The CFIA's offset and 1/f noise are mitigated by chopping, while its gain accuracy and gain drift are improved by applying dynamic element matching to its input and feedback transconductors. Their mismatch is reduced by a digitally assisted correction loop, which further reduces the CFIA's gain drift. Finally, bulk-biasing and impedance-balancing techniques are used to reduce the common-mode dependency of these transconductors, which would otherwise limit the achievable gain accuracy. The combination of these techniques enables the read-out IC to achieve 140-dB CMRR, a worst-case gain error of 0.04% over a 0-2.5 V common-mode range, a maximum gain drift of 0.7 ppm/°C and an INL of 5 ppm. After applying nested-chopping, the read-out IC achieves 50-nV offset, 6-nV/°C offset drift, a thermal noise floor of 16.2 nV/√Hz and a 0.1-mHz 1/f noise corner. Implemented in a 0.7-μm CMOS technology, the prototype read-out IC consumes 270 μA from a 5-V supply.},

abstract={A fast and high-precision all-digital automatic calibration circuit that is highly suited for ΔΣ fractional-N synthesizers is designed to achieve a constant loop bandwidth and fast lock time over an octave tuning range. A high-speed frequency-to-digital converter (FDC) measures VCO frequency on-chip with a sub-fREF frequency resolution of fREF/k in a time period of k·TREF. The on-chip detected VCO frequency is then used for calibrating the loop bandwidth and the VCO frequency. The loop bandwidth calibration circuit measures the VCO gain KVCO and uses it to precisely control the charge pump current, hence making the loop bandwidth constant. For the VCO frequency calibration, a minimum error code finding block significantly enhances the calibration accuracy by finding the truly closest code to the target frequency. Moreover, this method does not need to activate ΔΣ modulator to achieve sub- fREF calibration resolution, which makes this technique much accurate and faster than the conventional ones. A 1.9-3.8 GHz ΔΣ fractional-N synthesizer is implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS, demonstrating that the loop bandwidth calibration is completed in 1.1-6.0 μs with ±2% accuracy and the VCO frequency calibration is completed in 1.225-4.025 μs, all across the entire octave tuning range.},

title={32.9 nV/rt Hz ${-}$60.6 dB THD Dual-Band Micro-Electrode Array Signal Acquisition IC}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1209-1220}, 
abstract={The dual-band recording of the local-field potential (LFP, 0.1-200 Hz) and the spike potential (SP, 200 Hz-10 kHz) is important for physiological studies at the cellular level. Recent study shows that the LFP signal plays important roles in modulating many profound cellular mechanisms. Although various bio-signal acquisition circuits have been reported over the years, few designs are applicable to capture both LFP and SP signals. To record both signals accurately, acquisition circuits need low noise and good linearity in both bands. In this paper, we report the design of a dual-band acquisition IC for microelectrode array (MEA) recording. The novel design uses a continuous-time (CT) front-end with chopping to suppress the noise in the LFP band, and a discrete-time (DT) back-end to achieve good linearity. The acquisition channel is fully differential, which leads to a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) without the 50 Hz injection. The design interfaces the microelectrode with a transistor gate, which has high input impedance. A prototype monolithic acquisition IC is fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS process. It includes 16 channels and an 11 bit successive-approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Every channel acquires cellular signals up to 20 mVpp with 32.9 nV/Hz0.5 and <; 0.1% nonlinearity. The good linearity effectively prevents the aliasing and mixing between the two bands. For LFP signal, the recording noise is 0.9 μVrms. For SP signal, the recording noise is 3.3 μVrms. The new design has high input impedance (320 M Ω@1 kHz), high CMRR ( >; 110 dB) and PSRR ( >; 110 dB). The noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of the acquisition channel is 7.6. The IC is experimented to record the field potential from cultured rat c- rdiomyocytes in-vitro. Overall, the new MEA acquisition channel achieves the state-of-art performance.},

pages={1323-1333}, 
abstract={This paper presents an automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier with temperature compensation for high-speed applications. The proposed AGC consists of a folded Gilbert variable gain amplifier (VGA), a dc offset canceller, inductorless post amplifiers, a linear open-loop peak detector (PD), an integrator, a symmetrical exponential voltage generator, and a compensation block for temperature stability. The novel temperature compensation scheme ensures the AGC stability and accuracy over -20°C-200°C by predicting the integrator biasing voltage based on the crucial blocks duplication technique. The proposed linear open loop PD combined with the linear-in-dB VGA manages the dB-linear error of less than 0.3 dB for the received signal strength indication (RSSI). The AGC chip is fabricated using a 0.13-μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Consuming a power of 72 mW from a 1.2-V supply voltage, the fabricated circuit exhibits a voltage gain of 40 dB and a 3-dB bandwidth of 7.5 GHz. With a 215 - 1 pseudo-random bit sequence at 5-Gb/s, the measured peak-to-peak jitter is less than 40pspp across the -20°C-200°C temperature range. The low linear-in-dB error and the wide operating temperature range achieving the high-speed data input signal indicate the suitability of the proposed techniques for high-speed AGC amplifiers.},

abstract={This paper reports on efficient interfacing of typical vibration-driven electromagnetic transducers for micro energy harvesting. For this reason, an adaptive charge pump for dynamic maximum power point tracking is compared with a novel active full-wave rectifier design. For efficient ultra-low voltage rectification, the introduced active diode design uses a common-gate stage in conjunction with supply-independent biasing. While this active rectifier offers low voltage drops, low complexity and ultra-low power consumption, the adaptive charge pump allows dynamic maximum power point tracking with implicit voltage up-conversion. Hence, efficient energy harvesting with high-resistive transducers, e.g., electromagnetic generators, becomes possible even at buffer voltage levels far above actual transducer output voltages. Both interfaces are fully-integrated in a standard 0.35 μm twin-well CMOS process. The designs are optimized for sub-mW transducer power levels and wide supply voltage ranges. Thus, these presented transducer interfaces are particularly suitable for compact micro energy harvesting systems, such as wireless sensor nodes or medical implants. The active diode rectifier achieves efficiencies over 90% at a wide range of input voltage amplitudes of 0.48 V up to 3.3 V. The adaptive charge pump can harvest with a total efficiency of close to 50%, but very independent of the actual buffer voltage. This charge pump starts operating at a supply voltage of 0.8 V, and has an input voltage range of 0.5 V-2.5 V . Finally, results of harvesting from an actual electromagnetic generator prototype are presented.},

pages={2505-2516}, 
abstract={Timing compensation between the clock period and datapath delay in the presence of resonant supply noise has drawn a great deal of attention from the circuit design community. This effect, which is often referred to as the clock data compensation effect, manifests itself as an increase in maximum operating frequency for high performance microprocessors. In this work, we propose an adaptive phase-shifting PLL that can achieve optimal clock data compensation by digitally programming the supply noise sensitivity and the phase shift of the PLL clock period. Measurement results from a 1.2 V, 65 nm test chip demonstrate a 3.4-7.3% improvement in the maximum operating frequency across different clock distribution designs and resonant frequencies. A mathematical framework for simulating the performance of the adaptive phase-shifting PLL is presented for better insight on how the proposed PLL performs when used in different clock network configurations. In addition, the impact of the proposed technique on PLL stability as well as its effectiveness in a 32 nm process has been explored.},

pages={676-685}, 
abstract={Magnitude detection, such as envelope detection or RMS estimation, is needed for many low-power signal-analysis applications. In such applications, the temporal accuracy of the magnitude detector is as important as its amplitude accuracy. We present a low-power audio-frequency magnitude detector that simultaneously achieves both high temporal accuracy and high amplitude accuracy. This performance is achieved by rectifying the signal with a high-ripple peak detector and then averaging this rectified signal with an adaptive-time-constant filter. The time constant of this filter decreases with increasing amplitude, enabling the filter to quickly respond on a short time scale to transients, while steady-state ripple is averaged on a longer time scale. The circuit has been fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process and consumes only 1.1 nW-1.08 μW when tuned for operation from 20 Hz-20 kHz. It exhibits a dynamic range of 70 dB across typical speech frequencies.},

title={A 1500 fps Highly Sensitive 256 $,times,$256 CMOS Imaging Sensor With In-Pixel Calibration}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1408-1418}, 
abstract={High-speed CMOS imaging sensors (CIS) normally have low sensitivity because of the large integration capacitance. They also have high noise because pixel circuits cannot implement correlated double sampling (CDS) to remove the pixel reset noise. For applications, such as micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), this is a major limitation. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve high sensitivity and low noise for high-speed CIS. To maximize the sensitivity, we designed a new capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) pixel with a tiny metal-oxide-metal capacitor. The pixel circuit also implements CDS. As a result, the temporal noise is greatly reduced, and the sensitivity improves dramatically. To compensate the mismatch of small integration capacitors across the pixel array, an on-chip calibration scheme with in-pixel circuits is developed. Fully differential column circuits are designed to suppress the power supply injection in the large array of high-speed column circuits. A successive-approximation analog-to-digital (SAR ADC) is designed to achieve 10-bit resolution and to fit in the 15-μm column pitch. For testing modes, column circuits are configured into a two-step ADC to provide 13-bit dynamic range. The 256 × 256 CIS design is fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process. The imager samples up to 1500 fps. The pixel integration capacitor is 0.7 fF, which enables 68.5 V/lux · s sensitivity under the white illumination. The CIS temporal noise is 13.6e-. This sensitivity and noise performances are much better than previous high-speed CIS benchmark designs. Running at 1500 fps, the CIS can capture recognizable images with illumination down to 1 lux. The on-chip calibration suppresses the fixed-pattern noise lower than 0.52%. The prototype chip consumes 390 mW of power.},

pages={547-559}, 
abstract={Circuit techniques for enhancing the retention time and random cycle of logic-compatible embedded DRAMs (eDRAMs) are presented. An asymmetric 2T gain cell utilizes the gate and junction leakages of a PMOS write device to maintain a high data `1' voltage level which enables fast read access using an NMOS read device. A current-mode sense amplifier (C-S/A) featuring a cross-coupled PMOS latch and pseudo-PMOS diode pairs is proposed to overcome the innate problem of small read bit-line (RBL) voltage swing in 2T eDRAMs with improved voltage headroom and better impedance matching under process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. A half-swing write bit-line (WBL) scheme is adopted to improve the WBL speed by 33% and reduce its power dissipation by 25% during write-back operation with no effect on retention time. A stepped write word-line (WWL) driver reduces the current drawn from the boosted high and low supplies by 67%. A 192 kb eDRAM test chip with 512 cells-per-BL implemented in a 65 nm low-power (LP) CMOS process shows a random cycle frequency and latency of 667 MHz and 1.65 ns, respectively, at 1.1 V and 85 × °C. The measured refresh period at a 99.9% bit yield condition was 110 μs which is comparable to that of recently published 1T1C eDRAM designs.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel single-ended disturb-free 9T subthreshold SRAM cell with cross-point data-aware Write word-line structure. The disturb-free feature facilitates bit-interleaving architecture, which can reduce multiple-bit upsets in a single word and enhance soft error immunity by employing Error Checking and Correction (ECC) technique. The proposed 9T SRAM cell is demonstrated by a 72 Kb SRAM macro with a Negative Bit-Line (NBL) Write-assist and an adaptive Read operation timing tracing circuit implemented in 65 nm low-leakage CMOS technology. Measured full Read and Write functionality is error free with VDD down to 0.35 V ( 0.15 V lower than the threshold voltage) with 229 KHz frequency and 4.05 μW power. Data is held down to 0.275 V with 2.29 μW Standby power. The minimum energy per operation is 4.5 pJ at 0.5 V. The 72 Kb SRAM macro has wide operation range from 1.2 V down to 0.35 V, with operating frequency of around 200 MHz for VDD around/above 1.0 V.},

abstract={A 0.025-0.45 W inductive-coupling power transceiver for non-contact memory applications is presented. To deal with sudden and large load variations and achieve high-efficiency, we propose a power transceiver with 5-bit feedforward control. Knowing that load patterns of a memory card have strong correlation with commands issued by a host, feedforward control is applied to minimize response times. To achieve 5-bit power levels, the proposed transceiver utilizes pulse-density modulation (PDM) and a multi-channel structure. Different operation frequencies are chosen for each channel to maximize power transfer efficiency. To further improve transceiver efficiency and enable high-speed operation, an active rectifier with a fast positive feedback is proposed. The test prototype demonstrates 40%-70% efficiency across all load conditions and 60% efficiency in average, which are over an order of magnitude improvements compared to prior arts.},

year={2012},

pages={722-735}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 0.5-V 1.5-bit double-sampled ΔΣ modulator for audio applications. Unlike existing double-sampled designs, the proposed double-sampled ΔΣ modulator employs an input-feedforward topology to reduce internal signal swings, thereby relaxing design requirements for the low-voltage building blocks and reducing distortion. Moreover, in order to avoid instability and noise shaping degradation, the proposed architecture restores the noise transfer function (NTF) of the double-sampled modulator to its single-sampled equivalent with the help of compensation loops. In the circuit implementation, the proposed fully-differential amplifier adopts an inverter output stage and a common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuit with a global feedback loop in order to reduce power consumption. A resistor-string-reference switch matrix based on a direct summation quantizer is used to simplify the analog compensation loop. The chip prototype has been fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS technology with a core area of 0.57 mm2. The measured results show that when operating from a 0.5-V supply and clocked at 1.25 MHz, the modulator achieves a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 81.7 dB, a peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 82.4 dB and a dynamic range (DR) of 85.0 dB while consuming 35.2 μW for a 20-kHz signal bandwidth.},

abstract={This paper describes the design of a multi-gigabit fiber-optic receiver with integrated large-area photo detectors for plastic optical fiber applications. An integrated 250 μm diameter non-SML NW/P-sub photo detector is adopted to allow efficient light coupling. The theory of applying a fully-differential pre-amplifier with a single-ended photo current is also examined and a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier has been proposed to drive a C PD of 14 pF to multi-gigahertz frequency. Both differential and common-mode operations of the proposed super-Gm transimpedance amplifier have been analyzed and a differential noise analysis is performed. A digitally-controlled linear equalizer is proposed to produce a slow-rising-slope frequency response to compensate for the photo detector up to 3 GHz. The proposed POF receiver consists of an illuminated signal photo detector, a shielded dummy photo detector, a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier, a variable-gain amplifier, a linear equalizer, a post amplifier, and an output driver. A test chip is fabricated in TSMC's 65 nm low-power CMOS process, and it consumes 50 mW of DC power (excluding the output driver) from a single 1.2 V supply. A bit-error rate of less than 10-12 has been measured at a data rate of 3.125 Gbps with a 670 nm VCSEL-based electro-optical transmitter.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47},

pages={769-780}, 
abstract={We design an Acoustic Digital Signal Processor (ADSP) SoC, the primary signal processing module of an acoustic signal detection system, based on two design approaches: fully-synchronous (Fully-Sync), and globally-asynchronous-locally-synchronous (GALS). The emphasis of the ADSP designs is low power operation where both designs embody modular-level and circuit-level clock gating techniques. For sake of fair benchmarking, both ADSPs have identical functionality, are designed using the same 130 nm CMOS process, and largely embody the same library cells (save that for the signaling protocols in the GALS ADSP). The GALS ADSP is substantially more power-efficient (the Fully-Sync ADSP dissipates 1.9× more power @ nominal VDD = 1.2 V) and the only cost is the marginally higher (1.02×) IC area. Its higher power efficiency is largely attributed to the exploitation of asynchronous signaling between circuit modules by means of more finely-grained partitioning of the clock domains; intra-circuit signaling therein remains fully-sync. This provides for the ensuing simplification of the clocking infrastructure and subsequent reduction of the global clock rate. The prototype GALS ADSP is able to operate to specifications throughout the lifespan of the battery (VDD = 0.9 V-1.4 V, in part depicting Dynamic Voltage Scaling attributes) and at VDD = 1.2 V, it dissipates 186 μW.},

title={An Embedded DRAM Technology for High-Performance NAND Flash Memories}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47},

pages={536-546}, 
abstract={An embedded DRAM using a standard NAND flash memory process has been demonstrated for the first time. This embedded DRAM without extra costly manufacturing process realizes 2.4 mm2 /Mb macro density and provides large-capacity on-chip page buffers and data caches for NAND flash memories to enhance their performances. A 32 KB DRAM buffer macro with 1.5 μm2cell has been fabricated with a 32 nm NAND flash memory process. Even with small 3 fF cell using a planar MOS capacitor, an enough ±100 mV cell signal has been obtained by introducing a technique to self-boost cell node up to 4 V using a merit of high-voltage NAND flash process, and two techniques to curtail parasitic bitline capacitance down to 60 fF at 128 wordlines per bitline. An undershoot problem of cell nodes due to unwanted plateline bounce is resolved by a two-step-rise/fall wordline scheme. Installation of dummy cell scheme to obtain a half of “1” data (not an average of “1” and “0” data) cuts out 32 KB macro size by 1.3% while suppressing mismatch to 3 mV at the grounded bitline precharge. The 32 KB test vehicle shows 90 ns random cycle time with 15 ns burst cycle time (66 Mb/s/pin). The measured characteristics of 2 × 10-18 bit error rater (BER) by soft error and 10 ms data retention at 85 °C are enough for page buffer application in a NAND flash memory. The measured active current of 32 KB macro is 7 mA at 90 ns random cycle, but only 3.2 mA at practical use of 15 ns burst with 256B page access.},

abstract={This paper describes an all-digital PVT-variation tolerant true-random number generator (TRNG), fabricated in 45 nm high-k/metal-gate CMOS, targeted for on-die entropy generation in high-performance microprocessors.

title={A Triple-Mode Balanced Linear CMOS Power Amplifier Using a Switched-Quadrature Coupler}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2019-2032}, 
abstract={A triple-mode class-AB balanced linear power amplifier (PA) is realized in standard 0.18-μm CMOS technology. For the average efficiency enhancement, the triple-mode operation realizes a switched-quadrature coupler with a balanced topology to achieve robust load insensitivity. The PA and RF switches uniquely utilize the isolation port of the switched-quadrature coupler as a signal path in a low-power (LP) mode of operation, and the incorporated output matching network satisfies the |Γ| = 1 condition from the quadrature coupler in the LP mode while providing the necessary load-pull impedance from the PA output side in the high-power (HP) mode. To obtain low loss and high quality factor ( Q) of the passive output-combining network, a transformer-based quadrature coupler is implemented using a silicon-based integrated passive device process. With a 3.4-V power supply, the PA transmits a maximum output power of 28.4 dBm with 40.7% of power-added efficiency (PAE) and linear output power up to 26.6 dBm with 35% of the PAE using a 3-GPP WCDMA modulated signal. With the triple-mode operation, a PAE at 16 dBm is enhanced from 11.1% to 17%, and 47 mA of quiescent current is saved. The PA also shows robust operation under 2.5:1 of VSWR condition, achieving 1 dB of the gain variation and less than 3.9 dB of ACLR variation. This work demonstrates the potential of a highly efficient CMOS PA for WCDMA applications.},

number={4}, 
pages={875-883}, 
abstract={This paper presents a low-power noise-shaping ΔΣ time-to-digital converter (TDC) and its application to a fractional-N digital PLL. With a simple structure of single-delay-stage Δ modulator followed by a charge pump based Σ modulator, a wide range of TDC input is converted to ΔΣ modulated single bit stream without loss of signal information. The ΔΣ architecture of TDC effectively improves the conversion performance of linearity and resolution while handling a large input range due to the operation of the dual-modulus divider. In addition, with a downscaling of the amount of the single delay in Δ modulator, the signal and noise transfer characteristics of TDC can be profiled to suppress the out-band noises at the input to the loop filter, resulting in easy filtering without any extra noise cancelling scheme.

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2068-2079}, 
abstract={A single-ended transmitter (Tx) is proposed to compensate for the crosstalk-induced jitter (CIJ) of coupled microstrip lines by subtracting a mimicked crosstalk waveform from data signal at Tx during the data transition time, depending on the data transition of an adjacent line. Since the CIJ component is proportional to the time derivative of data signal, the mimicked crosstalk waveform subtracted at Tx cancels the CIJ at receiver (Rx) for the linearly changing data signal with time. As a by-product, this scheme reduces ISI at Rx. The Tx chip in a 0.13-μm CMOS process reduces the total Rx jitter by 96 ps (69%) at 7.2 Gbps (4-in channels) and by 120 ps (72%) at 6 Gbps (8-in channels).},

To achieve the nano-watt range power consumption, an ultra-low power design strategy has been utilized, imposing maximum simplicity on the ADC architecture, low transistor count and matched capacitive DAC with a switching scheme which results in full-range sampling without switch bootstrapping and extra reset voltage. Furthermore, a dual-supply voltage scheme allows the SAR logic to operate at 0.4 V, reducing the overall power consumption of the ADC by 15% without any loss in performance. The ADC was fabricated in 0.13-μm CMOS. In dual-supply mode (1.0 V for analog and 0.4 V for digital), the ADC consumes 53 nW at a sampling rate of 1 kS/s and achieves the ENOB of 9.1 bits. The leakage power constitutes 25% of the 53-nW total power.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={2}, 
pages={381-391}, 
abstract={A power-efficient quadrature receiver employing a down-converter that uses a passive current-commutating mixer for frequency translation is presented. The architecture uses bias-current sharing between the RF and baseband stages while making the full supply voltage available to either stage. An input transconductor, realized using a differential common-source stage, converts the RF signal into a current, while baseband amplification is achieved using a transimpedance amplifier. Active noise shaping networks are implemented for reducing low-frequency noise at the output that can arise from the RF and baseband transconductors. Linearity is enhanced by synthesizing a nonlinear gain in the transimpedance amplifier to compensate for baseband compression. The design includes variable gain capability. An on-chip divider is employed to synthesize quadrature LO signals. Noise and linearity performance of the core down-converter is analyzed. The receiver is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The prototype achieves a maximum conversion gain of 44.5 dB, NF of 4.3 dB, in-channel OIP3 of 20 dBV while consuming 2.2 mA in each of the quadrature paths from a 1.8 V supply. This performance is achieved without the use of integrated inductors, which allows for a small die area of 0.5 mm2.},

abstract={An energy-efficient crystal-less double-FSK transceiver for wireless body-area-network (WBAN) sensor nodes is implemented in 0.18-μm CMOS technology with a 1-V supply. The injection-locking digitally controlled oscillator (IL-DCO) replaces the crystal oscillator (XO), which leads to significantly reduce the energy consumption and system cost. With the proposed calibration method using an injection-locking detector (IL-detector), the frequency drift of DCO can be calibrated within 100-kHz accuracy over 100° temperature variation. For the full satisfaction to the WBAN requirements, such as wide range of quality of service in terms of data rate, bit error rate, and network coexistence, we adopt a scalable double-FSK modulation scheme with divider-based transmitter by a power-efficient switching modulator. As a result, the fabricated crystal-less double-FSK WBAN compatible sensor node transceiver consumes 1 and 2 mW in calibrating and transmitting modes, respectively, at a data rate of up to 10 Mb/s, providing an 80 MHz reference source with 100-kHz accuracy by auto-calibrated DCO.},

pages={897-910}, 
abstract={A low-power receiver circuit in 32 nm SOI CMOS is presented, which is intended to be used in a source-synchronous link configuration. The design of the receiver was optimized for power owing to the assumption that a link protocol enables a periodic calibration during which the circuit does not have to deliver valid data. In addition, it is shown that the transceiver power and the effect of high-frequency transmit jitter can be reduced by implementing a linear equalizer only on the receive side and avoiding a transmit feed-forward equalizer (TX-FFE). On the circuit level, the receiver uses a switched-capacitor (SC) approach for the implementation of an 8-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). The SC-DFE improves the timing margin relative to previous DFE implementations with current feedback, and leads to a digital-style circuit implementation with compact layout. The receiver was measured at data rates up to 13.5 Gb/s, where error free operation was verified with a PRBS-31 sequence and a channel with 32 dB attenuation at Nyquist. With the clock generation circuits amortized over eight lanes, the receiver circuit consumes 2.6 mW/Gbps from a 1.1 V supply while running at 12.5 Gb/s.},

abstract={In this paper, we describe a noncontact inductive-coupling data transmission link employing rotary data encoding. A system using this data-transmission link is inherently insensitive to jitter introduced in the channel and consumes approximately 50% less power than previously reported solutions. The system is targeted for applications benefiting from simultaneous noncontact power and data transmission, such as wafer-level testing, memory card interfaces, and inter-strata data communication in 3-D integrated circuits. Functionality of the proposed link is verified experimentally with a test chip developed in an 0.18-μm CMOS process. In the second part of this paper, we introduce a design of a high-speed data transceiver using rotary coding. We demonstrate that, because of properties of the rotary coding, a simple transceiver without a PLL-based CDR circuit can operate at data rates limited only by characteristics of the physical channel. For performance optimization, we have developed a new family of ternary logic gates including latches, D-flip-flops, and multiplexers.},

The maximum detector insertion loss up to 50 GHz is 0.1 dB relative to that for a thru structure with a maximum loss of 0.25 dB. The detectors for the first time are simultaneously compact, high impedance, and wide bandwidth. The Schottky diode and detectors are also the first demonstration in nano-scale SOI CMOS. The detectors allow measurements of internal-node voltages of millimeter wave circuits with a DC voltmeter. Using the detectors, the frequency responses of node voltages and gains in a millimeter wave mixer are measured.

title={MRTP: Mobile Ray Tracing Processor With Reconfigurable Stream Multi-Processors for High Datapath Utilization}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={2}, 
pages={518-535}, 
abstract={This paper presents a mobile ray tracing processor (MRTP) with reconfigurable stream multi-processors (RSMPs) for high datapath utilization. The MRTP includes three RSMPs that operate in multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD) mode asynchronously to exploit instruction-level parallelism. Each RSMP is based on single instruction multiple thread (SIMT) architecture to exploit thread-level parallelism. An RSMP consists of twelve scalar processing elements (SPEs) that run multiple threads in parallel synchronously: twelve scalar threads or four vector threads depending on an operating mode. A low datapath utilization caused by a branch divergence in SIMT architecture is improved by 19.9% on average by reconfiguring twelve SPEs between scalar SIMT and vector SIMT with 0.1% area overheads. Special function instructions occupy only 2% ~ 8% of kernel instructions so that a partial special function unit (PSFU) is implemented instead of a large dedicated SFU. The access conflicts with a look-up table (LUT) caused by concurrent accesses of twelve SPEs are reduced by a table loader (TBLD). The TBLD monitors concurrent requests from twelve SPEs and reduces an access count to LUT by distributing a coefficient to multiple SPEs with only one read-access to LUT. MRTP with area of 4 × 4 mm2 has been fabricated in 0.13 μm CMOS technology. MRTP achieves a peak performance of 673 K rays per second while consuming 156 mW at 100 MHz with VDD = 1.2 V .},

abstract={In this paper the fundamental concept of ring amplification is introduced and explored. Ring amplifiers enable efficient amplification in scaled environments, and possess the benefits of efficient slew-based charging, rapid stabilization, compression-immunity (inherent rail-to-rail output swing), and performance that scales with process technology. A basic operational theory is established, and the core benefits of this technique are identified. Measured results from two separate ring amplifier based pipelined ADCs are presented. The first prototype IC, a simple 10.5-bit, 61.5 dB SNDR pipelined ADC which uses only ring amplifiers, is used to demonstrate the core benefits. The second fabricated IC presented is a high-resolution pipelined ADC which employs the technique of Split-CLS to perform efficient, accurate amplification aided by ring amplifiers. The 15-bit ADC is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology and achieves 76.8 dB SNDR and 95.4 dB SFDR at 20 Msps while consuming 5.1 mW, achieving a FoM of 45 fJ/conversion-step.},

title={Electronic Temperature Compensation of Lateral Bulk Acoustic Resonator Reference Oscillators Using Enhanced Series Tuning Technique}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1381-1393}, 
abstract={This paper reports on the demonstration of series tuning for lateral micromechanical oscillators and its application for electronic temperature compensation of piezoelectric lateral bulk acoustic resonator (LBAR) micromechanical oscillators. Two aluminum nitride-on-silicon (AlN-on-Si) piezoelectric LBARs, one operating at 427 MHz (Rm ≈180 Ω, Qunloaded ≈ 1400) and the other operating at 541 MHz (Rm ≈ 55 Ω, Qunloaded ≈ 3000) are interfaced with a 13 mW three-stage tunable TIA implemented in 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS process to sustain the oscillation. Recognizing the impact on the frequency tuning range due to the body capacitances appearing in parallel with the ports of the resonator, the TIA uses parasitic cancellation techniques to neutralize this effect and boost the tuning range of 427 MHz and 541 MHz oscillators, by as much as 12× to 810 ppm and 1,530 ppm, respectively, with negligible impact on the phase noise performance. The shunt parasitic capacitor is either resonated out with an active inductor or is cancelled out by using a single-terminal negative capacitor of equal value. However, the oscillator that uses negative capacitance parasitic cancellation yields larger tuning. This extended tuning range is used for temperature compensation. A 2 mW bandgap-based temperature compensation circuit which uses second-order parabolic approximation is fabricated on the same chip. Using this temperature compensation circuit has lowered the overall frequency drift of a 427 MHz tunable oscillator using negative capacitance cancellation from ±390 ppm to ±35 ppm in the -10°C to 70°C temperature range. The phase noise of this oscillator reaches -82 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset. The total phase noise variation for offset frequencies below 10 kHz is under 5 dB within the specified tuning range, and the best phase noise floor is under -147 dBc/Hz . Due to the high- r Q and lower insertion loss of the resonating tank, the 541 MHz oscillator achieves -86 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset, and lower phase noise floor of -158 dBc/Hz.},

abstract={A 10-bit 200-MS/s pipelined ADC was fabricated using a standard 65 nm CMOS technology. We propose a dual-path amplification technique for residue generation. We split the pipeline stage into a coarse-stage multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) and a fine-stage MDAC. The opamps for these two MDACs require different specifications. They can be designed and optimized separately. They are turned off when not in use to save power. We modify the operation of a pipeline stage to accommodate the dual-path scheme by using time-interleaving capacitor sets. Operating at 200 MS/s sampling rate, this ADC consumes 5.37 mW from a 1 V supply. It achieves a signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) better than 55 dB SNDR over the entire Nyquist band. The chip active area is 0.19 mm2 .},

The microprocessor can execute user-defined programs: we demonstrate the execution of the multiplication of two 4-bit numbers and the calculation of the moving average of a string of incoming 6-bit numbers. To execute such dedicated tasks on the microprocessor, we create small plastic circuits that generate the sequences of appropriate instructions. The near transparency, mechanical flexibility, and low power consumption of the processor are attractive features for integration on everyday objects, where it could be programmed as, amongst other items, a calculator, timer, or game controller.},

abstract={Supply voltage reduction beyond the minimum energy per operation point is advantageous for supply voltage constrained applications, but is limited by the degradation of on-to-off current ratios with decreasing supply. In this work, we show that the effective on-to-off ratio can be considerably improved by the use of Schmitt Trigger structures, which effectively reduce the leakage from the gate output node and thereby stabilize the output level. A method for applying this concept to general logic is presented. Design rules concerning transistor sizing, gate selection and layout necessary to further minimize the required supply voltage are outlined and applied to the design of a chip implementing 8 × 8 bit multipliers as test structures. The only custom design step is the creation of the Schmitt Trigger standard-cell library, otherwise a regular digital tool chain is used. The multipliers exhibit full functionality down to supply voltages of 84 mV-62 mV, depending on the area overhead invested. No process or post-silicon tuning like body biasing is used. At the minimum possible supply voltage of 62 mV, a power consumption of 17.9 nW at an operation frequency of 5.2 kHz is measured for an 8 × 8 bit multiplier.},

abstract={An LDPC codec chip supporting four code rates of IEEE 802.15.3c applications is presented. After utilizing row-based layered scheduling, the normalized min-sum (NMS) algorithm can reduce half of the iteration number while maintaining similar performance. According to the unique code structure of the parity-check matrix, a reconfigurable 8/16/32-input sorter is designed to deal with LDPC codes in four different code rates. Both sorter input reallocation and pre-coded routing switch are proposed to alleviate routing complexity, leading to 64% input reduction of multiplexers. In addition, an adder-accumulator-shift register (AASR) circuit is proposed for the LDPC encoder to reduce hardware complexity. After implemented in 65-nm 1P10M CMOS process, the proposed LDPC decoder chip can achieve maximum 5.79-Gb/s throughput with the hardware efficiency of 3.7 Gb/s/mm2 and energy efficiency of 62.4 pJ/b, respectively.},

title={An Event-Driven Multi-Kernel Convolution Processor Module for Event-Driven Vision Sensors}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={2}, 
pages={504-517}, 
abstract={Event-Driven vision sensing is a new way of sensing visual reality in a frame-free manner. This is, the vision sensor (camera) is not capturing a sequence of still frames, as in conventional video and computer vision systems. In Event-Driven sensors each pixel autonomously and asynchronously decides when to send its address out. This way, the sensor output is a continuous stream of address events representing reality dynamically continuously and without constraining to frames. In this paper we present an Event-Driven Convolution Module for computing 2D convolutions on such event streams. The Convolution Module has been designed to assemble many of them for building modular and hierarchical Convolutional Neural Networks for robust shape and pose invariant object recognition. The Convolution Module has multi-kernel capability. This is, it will select the convolution kernel depending on the origin of the event. A proof-of-concept test prototype has been fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS process and extensive experimental results are provided. The Convolution Processor has also been combined with an Event-Driven Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) for high-speed recognition examples. The chip can discriminate propellers rotating at 2 k revolutions per second, detect symbols on a 52 card deck when browsing all cards in 410 ms, or detect and follow the center of a phosphor oscilloscope trace rotating at 5 KHz.},

abstract={A battery-free nano-power buck converter with a proposed dynamic on/off time (DOOT) control can achieve high conversion efficiency over a wide load range. The DOOT control can predict the on/off time at different input voltages without a power consuming zero current detection (ZCD) circuit, as well as suppress static power in idle periods. To adapt to the fluctuations in a harvesting system, the proposed α-calibration scheme guarantees accurate ZCD over process, voltage variation, and temperature (PVT) in the DOOT to improve power conversion efficiency. Furthermore, the adaptive phase lead (APL) mechanism can improve inherent propagation delay attributable to low-power and non-ideal comparator, thus improving load regulation by a maximum of 30 mV. The test chip was implemented in 0.25-μm CMOS process with a die area of 0.39 mm2. Experimental results showed 95% peak efficiency, low static power of 217 nW and good load regulation of 0.1 mV/mA, which are suitable for RF energy harvesting applications.},

abstract={A 7-bit, 2.2-GS/s time-interleaved subranging CMOS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for low-power gigabit wireless communication system-on-a-chip (SoC) is presented. A time-splitting subranging architecture is invented to significantly boost the speed of individual ADC channels. In addition, a low-power and fast-settling distributed resistor array for reference voltages is proposed to mitigate gain mismatches within channels. Moreover, the channel offset mismatches are calibrated through the digital- controlled corrective current sources embedded in the track-and-hold amplifiers of each sub-ADC. The prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS, occupying only 0.3 mm2 chip area and consuming 40 mW at 2.2 GS/s from a 1 V supply. Measured signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) are 38 dB and 46 dB, respectively, with a 1.08 GHz input at 2.2 GS/s sampling rate. The effective number of bits (ENOB) is 6.0 bits at Nyquist rate, and the figure-of-merit (F.O.M.) is 0.28 pJ/conv.-step. This prototype has also been integrated into a gigabit self-healing wireless transceiver SoC.},

abstract={A single-channel, asynchronous successive-approximation (SA) ADC with improved feedback delay is fabricated in 40 nm CMOS. Compared with a conventional SAR structure that employs a single quantizer controlled by a digital feedback logic loop, the proposed SAR-ADC employs multiple quantizers for each conversion bit, clocked by an asynchronous ripple clock that is generated after each quantization. Hence, the sampling rate of the 6-bit ADC is limited only by the six delays of the Capacitive-DAC settling and each comparator's quantization delay, as the digital logic delay is eliminated. Measurement results of the 40 nm-CMOS SAR-ADC achieves a peak SNDR of 32.9 dB and 30.5 dB, at 1 GS/s and 1.25 GS/s, consuming 5.28 mW and 6.08 mW, leading to a FoM of 148 fJ/conv-step and 178 fJ/conv-step, respectively, in a core area less than 170 um by 85 um.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1436-1447}, 
abstract={The digital delay-locked loop (DLL) with racing mode and the countered column address strobe (CAS) latency controller are proposed in this paper. The dual-DLL architecture with racing operation is adopted to achieve low power consumption, low jitter, fast locking, wide range of locking, and stuck-free control. The merged dual coarse delay line (MDCDL) reduces the dynamic power consumption of a variable delay line by 30% by sharing a part of the delay line path in DLL. In addition, jitter is reduced by 45 ps in the 1066-DDR3 operating mode by MDCDL. The proposed DLL utilizes an or-and functioned duty cycle corrector (or-and DCC), which consumes 15% of DLL's power, 0.915 pJ/Hz at tCK=1.5 ns and VDD=1.575 V. The countered CAS latency controller (CCLC) saves IDD3N current because it does not need a DLL clock and does not need to be activated for IDD3N (active non-power down) state. The DLL clock is enabled and CCLC is activated only when the read command is issued. This operation condition saves the IDD3N current by 60% with the proposed DLL. The proposed DLL is employed in 128 M×8 DDR3 SDRAM and 64 M×16 DDR3 SDRAM. The former and the latter are fabricated by 5×nm and by 4× nm DRAM process technology, respectively. Experimental results show that ±10% duty error of the external clock can be corrected to within ±2% duty error in less than 512 cycles of locking time under 1.5 ns of tCK. The proposed DLL and CCLC can operate above 1.0-GHz operating frequency at 1.2 V in 5× nm DDR3 SDRAM and at 1.0 V in 4× nm DDR3 SDRAM, respectively. The proposed DLL fabricated with 4× nm technology consumes 6.1 pJ/Hz at 1.575 V.},

abstract={This paper presents new image sensors with multi- bucket pixels that enable time-multiplexed exposure, an alter- native imaging approach. This approach deals nicely with scene motion, and greatly improves high dynamic range imaging, structured light illumination, motion corrected photography, etc. To implement an in-pixel memory or a bucket, the new image sensors incorporate the virtual phase CCD concept into a standard 4-transistor CMOS imager pixel. This design allows us to create a multi-bucket pixel which is compact, scalable, and supports true correlated double sampling to cancel kTC noise. Two image sensors with dual and quad-bucket pixels have been designed and fabricated. The dual-bucket sensor consists of a 640H × 576V array of 5.0 μm pixel in 0.11 μm CMOS technology while the quad-bucket sensor comprises 640H × 512V array of 5.6 μm pixel in 0.13 μm CMOS technology. Some computational photography applications were implemented using the two sensors to demonstrate their values in eliminating artifacts that currently plague computational photography.},

There is also DSP for integral non-linearity error reduction and suppression of clock sub-harmonics. The DAC uses a segmented architecture with 4 unary most significant bits and an R/2R ladder for the 10 binary least significant bits. Distributed resampling is applied to all current sources to improve the dynamic performance. At 7.2 GSa/s it delivers at least 67 dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) across the whole Nyquist region and an SNR of 62 dB.

pages={2846-2856}, 
abstract={Floating-gate (FG) transistors serve as attractive media for nonvolatile storage of analog parameters. However, conventional FG current memories when used for storing subthreshold currents are sensitive to variations in temperature which limit their applications to controlled environments. In this paper, we propose a temperature-compensated high-density array of FG current memories that can be used for storing subthreshold currents ranging from picoamperes to nanoamperes. The core of the proposed architecture is a feedback control technique that uses a varactor to adapt the FG capacitance in a manner that the temperature-dependent factors are effectively canceled. As a result, the stored current is only a function of a reference current and the differential charge stored on the FG. Measured results from prototype arrays fabricated in a 0.5-μm CMOS process demonstrate a worst case temperature sensitivity of 150 ppm/°K and programmability down to a few picoamperes. In this regard, we also present a novel method to precisely program currents on the proposed FG memory array by exploiting a linearizing property of the integrated varactor.},

abstract={A wideband digital RF receiver front-end employing a discrete-time (DT) filter is presented for application to m-WiMAX (WiBro). By employing a sampling mixer and a DT filter, the receiver operates in the charge domain. In addition to the flexibility of the DT filter, the new non-decimation finite impulse response (NDF) filter can be cascaded to a conventional finite impulse response (FIR) filter without the decimation effect. Thus, we can easily increase the order of the sincn function-type filtering response and the signal processing bandwidth. The FIR filter is also modified to reduce the noise and the number of required clock signal. Because of the new filter configuration, clock signals can be shared by the FIR filter and NDF filter and the clock generator circuit can be simplified. The designed receiver front-end is implemented using an IBM 0.13-μm RF CMOS process. The fabricated chip satisfies the m-WiMAX specification of an 8.75 MHz channel bandwidth and the total system current dissipation is 26.63 mA from a 1.5-V supply voltage.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a scalable transmitter architecture for power generation and beam-steering at THz frequencies using a centralized frequency reference, sub-harmonic signal distribution, and local phase control. The power generation and radiator core is based on a novel method called distributed active radiation, which enables high conversion efficiency from DC to radiated terahertz power above fmax of a technology. The design evolution of the distributed active radiator (DAR) follows from an inverse design approach, where metal surface currents at different harmonics are formulated in the silicon chip for the desired electromagnetic field profiles. Circuits and passives are then designed conjointly to synthesize and control the surface currents. The DAR consists of a self-oscillating active electromagnetic structure, comprising of two loops which sustain out-of-phase currents at the fundamental frequency and in-phase currents at the second harmonic. The fundamental signal, thus gets, spatially filtered, while the second harmonic is radiated selectively, thereby consolidating signal generation, frequency multiplication, radiation of desired harmonic and filtration of undesired harmonics simultaneously in a small silicon footprint. A two-dimensional 4×4 radiating array implemented in 45 nm SOI CMOS (without high-resistivity substrate) radiates with an EIRP of +9.4 dBm at 0.28 THz and beam-steers in 2D over 80° in both azimuth and elevation. The chip occupies 2.7 mm × 2.7 mm and dissipates 820 mW of DC power. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported integrated beam-scanning array at THz frequencies in silicon.},

abstract={Many mobile SoC chips employ a “two-macro” approach including volatile and nonvolatile memory macros (i.e. SRAM and Flash), to achieve high-performance or low-voltage power-on operation with the capability of power-off nonvolatile data storage. However, the two-macro approach suffers from slow store/restore speeds due to word-by-word serial transfer of data between the volatile and nonvolatile memories. Slow store/restore speeds require long power-on/off time and leave the device vulnerable to sudden power failure . This study proposes a resistive memory (memristor) based nonvolatile SRAM (or memristor latch) cell to achieve fast bit-to-bit parallel store/restore operations, low store/restore energy consumption, and a compact cell area. This resistive nonvolatile 8T2R (Rnv8T) cell includes two fast-write memristor (RRAM) devices vertical-stacked over the 8T, and a novel 2T memristor-switch, which provides both memristor control and SRAM write-assist functions. The write assist feature enables the Rnv8T cell to use read favored transistor sizing to prevent read/write failure at lower VDDs. We also fabricated the first macro-level memristor-based (or RRAM-based) nonvolatile SRAM. This 16 Kb Rnv8T macro achieved the lowest store energy and R/W VDDmin (0.45 V) of any nonvolatile SRAM or two-macro solution.},

abstract={Sensing systems such as biomedical implants, infrastructure monitoring systems, and military surveillance units are constrained to consume only picowatts to nanowatts in standby and active mode, respectively. This tight power budget places ultra-low power demands on all building blocks in the systems. This work proposes a voltage reference for use in such ultra-low power systems, referred to as the 2T voltage reference, which has been demonstrated in silicon across three CMOS technologies. Prototype chips in 0.13 μm show a temperature coefficient of 16.9 ppm/°C (best) and line sensitivity of 0.033%/V, while consuming 2.22 pW in 1350 μm2. The lowest functional Vdd 0.5 V. The proposed design improves energy efficiency by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude while exhibiting better line sensitivity and temperature coefficient in less area, compared to other nanowatt voltage references. For process spread analysis, 49 dies are measured across two runs, showing the design exhibits comparable spreads in TC and output voltage to existing voltage references in the literature. Digital trimming is demonstrated, and assisted one temperature point digital trimming, guided by initial samples with two temperature point trimming, enables TC <; 50 ppm/°C and ±0.35% output precision across all 25 dies. Ease of technology portability is demonstrated with silicon measurement results in 65 nm, 0.13 μm, and 0.18 μm CMOS technologies.},

abstract={A 59-GHz push-push voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based on 0.18m SiGe BiCMOS technology-for a full-band 60-GHz transceiver was developed. The VCO uses a loop-ground transmission line (LG-TML) composed of λf0/2 signal lines (half wavelength at fundamental frequency) and λ2f0/4 secondary lines (quarter wavelength at second harmonic frequency). The LG-TML makes it possible to output both a large signal at second harmonic frequency and an adequate signal at the fundamental frequency for driving a prescalar, while it prevents the Miller effect of the HBTs in the VCO from increasing and negative conductance from being reduced. As a result, the VCO achieves high output power of +1.5 dBm, while maintaining wide tuning range of 13.9 GHz (26% of the center oscillation frequency). Moreover, it exhibits a low phase noise of -108 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset frequency and achieves a state-of-the-art figure of merit (FOMT) of -189.6 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a (491,3,6) time-varying low-density parity check convolutional code (LDPC-CC) decoder chip. This work combines the algorithm level, node level, and bit level optimizations to achieve over 2 Gb/s throughput with acceptable hardware cost and power. The algorithm level optimization is the on-demand variable node activation scheduling with concealing channel values, which can not only achieve twice faster decoding convergence speed than log-belief propagation (log-BP) algorithm, but also reduce the 17% message storage capacity. The node level optimization duplicates the check node units and variable node units and unfolds the message storage first-in-first-outs (FIFOs) so that the throughput becomes twelve multiplying with clock frequency. In the meantime, the bit level optimization is employed to retime the critical path such that the higher clock frequency can be achieved and message storage size is slightly reduced. Furthermore, a novel hybrid-partitioned FIFO is proposed to provide sufficient memory bandwidth to processing units and alleviate power consumption. With these schemes, a test chip of proposed LDPC-CC decoder has been fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology with core area of 2.37 × 1.14 mm2. Maximum throughput 2.37 Gb/s is measured under 1.2 V supply with energy efficiency of 0.024 nJ/bit/proc. Depending on the operation mode, power can be scaled down to 90.2 mW while maintaining 1.58 Gb/s at 0.8 V supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a broadband single-ended input differential output low noise amplifier exploiting IM2 cancelling. A linear feedback from the common mode output to the single-ended input effectively cancels the second-order distortion products in the differential output. The feedback path can be designed for minimum noise, leading to equal or lower noise compared to the amplifier without feedback. A replica bias ensures reduced sensitivity to process, supply voltage and temperature variations. The measured IIP2 across the band from 230 MHz to 470 MHz, varies from 19 to 26 dBm when the feedback is disabled and from 28 to 34 dBm when the feedback is enabled. Measured NF is 2.25 dB in the VHF band and between 2 and 4 dB in the UHF band. Power dissipation is 7.8 mW .},

abstract={In this paper we will present a low-phase-noise wide-tuning-range oscillator suitable for scaled CMOS processes. It switches between the two resonant modes of a high-order LC resonator that consists of two identical LC tanks coupled by capacitor and transformer. The mode switching method does not add lossy switches to the resonator and thus doubles frequency tuning range without degrading phase noise performance. Moreover, the coupled resonator leads to 3 dB lower phase noise than a single LC tank, which provides a way of achieving low phase noise in scaled CMOS process. Finally, the novel way of using inductive and capacitive coupling jointly decouples frequency separation and tank impedances of the two resonant modes, and makes it possible to achieve balanced performance. The proposed structure is verified by a prototype in a low power 65 nm CMOS process, which covers all cellular bands with a continuous tuning range of 2.5-5.6 GHz and meets all stringent phase noise specifications of cellular standards. It uses a 0.6 V power supply and achieves excellent phase noise figure-of-merit (FoM) of 192.5 dB at 3.7 GHz and >; 188 dB across the entire tuning range. This demonstrates the possibility of achieving low phase noise and wide tuning range at the same time in scaled CMOS processes.},

abstract={A frequency-scalable, three-stage, transformer-coupled millimeter-wave power amplifier (PA) is implemented in 130 nm SiGe-BiCMOS. Differential common-base gain stages extend collector-emitter breakdown voltage beyond 3 V, while collector-emitter neutralization increases reverse isolation and stability. Monolithic self-shielded transformers designed for low insertion loss and compact dimensions on-chip include: a 2:4 input power splitter, a 4:1 output balun combiner and inter-stage coupling transformers. The balun combiner and fully-differential splitter are compensated for imbalances caused by parasitic interwinding capacitance, and simulations predict better than 3% uniformity between reflected port-to-port impedances at 60 GHz. Simulated impedance uniformity is within 6% from 55-65 GHz, and insertion loss of the 0.015 mm2 combiner prototypes at 60 GHz is below 1 dB. The 0.72 mm2 60 GHz-band PA realizes a measured peak small-signal gain higher than 20 dB with over 10 GHz 3 dB bandwidth. Reverse isolation is better than 51 dB from 50-65 GHz and the PA is unconditionally stable. It consumes 353 mW (quiescent) from a 1.8 V supply and the active area is 0.25 mm2. Maximum output power and peak power-added efficiency (PAE) are 20.1 dBm and 18% at 62 GHz, respectively. An up-banded 79-87.5 GHz PA is also implemented to verify frequency scalability of the design. The 0.23 mm2 active area 79 GHz PA prototype produces 18 dBm saturated output power and 9% peak-PAE at 84 GHz from a 2.5 V supply.},

abstract={A prototype 10-bit 80-MS/s pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) implemented in a 0.25-μm CMOS process is described. The prototype uses a combination of time-interleaved and lookahead operations to allow one clock period for comparator regeneration, reducing the bit error rate (BER) due to comparator metastability by a factor between 104 and 106. Also, the front-end sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) previously used to provide a 1/2 clock period of regeneration time for the first-stage comparators in a lookahead pipelined ADC is eliminated [1], [2], reducing the power consumption and the input-referred noise. The analog power dissipation is 72 mW from a 2.5-V supply. At a sampling rate of 80 MS/s, the prototype achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 58.3 dB for an input frequency of 80 kHz. Also, for a comparator bias current of 100 μA, extrapolations from measurements show that the BER is <;10-15 errors/sample.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={3}, 
pages={641-651}, 
abstract={This paper presents a novel all-digital CDR scheme in 90 nm CMOS. Two independently adjustable clock phases are generated from a delay line calibrated to 2 UI. One clock phase is placed in the middle of the eye to recover the data (“data clock”) and the other is swept across the delay line (“search clock”). As the search clock is swept, its samples are compared against the data samples to generate eye information. This information is used to determine the best phase for data recovery. After placing the search clock at this phase, search and data functions are traded between clocks and eye monitoring repeats. By trading functions, infinite delay range is realized using only a calibrated delay line, instead of a PLL or DLL. Since each clock generates its own alignment information, mismatches in clock distribution can be tolerated. The scheme's generalized sampling and retiming architecture is used in an efficient sharing technique that reduces the number of clocks required, saving power and area in high-density interconnect. The shared CDR is implemented using static CMOS logic in a 90 nm bulk process, occupying 0.15 mm2. It operates from 6 to 9 Gb/s, and consumes 2.5 mW/Gb/s of power at 6 Gb/s and 3.8 mW/Gb/s at 9 Gb/s.},

These modulators have the low jitter sensitivity and high linearity properties characteristic of a multibit modulator, while using a simple one-bit quantizer, thereby combining the advantages of single-bit and multibit operation. We propose a method to compensate the loop for the delay introduced by the FIR-DAC. The efficacy of our architectural and circuit techniques is borne out by measurement results from a modulator that achieves about 71-dB SNDR in a 36-MHz bandwidth while consuming only 15 mW from a 1.2-V supply.

abstract={This paper describes a reference-clock-free, high-time-resolution on-chip timing jitter measurement circuit using a self-referenced clock and a cascaded time difference amplifier (TDA) with duty-cycle compensation. A self-referenced clock with multiples of the clock period removes the necessity for a reference clock. In addition, a cascaded TDA with duty-cycle compensation improves the time resolution while maintaining the operational speed. Test chips were designed and fabricated using 65 nm and 40 nm CMOS technologies. The areas occupied by the circuits are 1350 μm2 (with TDA, 65 nm), 490 μm2 (without TDA, 65 nm), 470 μm2 (with TDA, 40 nm), and 112 μm2 (without TDA, 40 nm). Time resolutions of 31 fs (with TDA) and 2.8 ps (without TDA) were achieved.

abstract={We apply the “assisted opamp technique” to the design of a 1 GS/s single-bit continuous-time ΔΣ modulator (CTDSM) that achieves 10 bit resolution in 15.625 MHz bandwidth. The enhanced linearity and speed of the first integrator of the modulator, necessitated by single-bit operation, are obtained in a power efficient manner using opamp assistance. However, timing-skew between the feedback and assistant DAC currents can be a potential problem at high speeds. We analyze and give intuition for the effects of timing mismatch in such CTDSMs, and show that opamp assistance is quite robust to timing errors. Measurement results from an implementation in a 0.13 μ m CMOS process show that the modulator achieves a dynamic range of 67 dB in 15.625 MHz bandwidth while consuming 4 mW.},

abstract={A near-threshold forwarded-clock I/O receiver architecture is presented. In the proposed receiver, the majority of the circuitry is designed to operate in the near-threshold region at 0.6 V supply to save power, with the exception of only the global clock buffer, test buffers and synthesized digital circuits at the nominal 1 V supply. To ensure the quantizers are working properly with this low supply, a 1:10 direct demultiplexing rate is chosen as a demonstration of achieving low supply operation by high-parallelism. A novel low-power super-harmonic injection-locked ring oscillator is proposed to generate deskewable symmetric multi-phase local clock phases. The relative performance impact of including a per-data lane sample-and-hold (S/H) to improve quantizer aperture time at low voltage is demonstrated with two receiver prototypes fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Including the amortized power of global clock distribution, the receiver without S/H consumes 1.3 mW and the one with S/H consumes 2 mW at an 8 Gb/s input data rate, which converts to 0.163 pJ/bit and 0.25 pJ/bit, respectively. Measurement results show both receivers get BER <; 10-12 across a 20-cm FR4 PCB channel.},

The interface is equipped with a compact voltage-mode driver with 1-tap pre-emphasis, in the WRITE direction, and a linear equalizer (LEQ) and 1-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE), in the READ direction, to compensate for channel inter-symbol interference (ISI). The receiver front-end contains a supply noise tracking scheme to mitigate reference voltage (VREF) noise. A tri-VCO PLL and an efficient global clock distribution scheme support a wide range of operating frequencies at low power consumption. Finally, the interface also incorporates two overhead links per byte for data-bus encoding (DBE) experiments to mitigate simultaneous switching noise (SSN). Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, the × 16 tri-modal interface achieves an energy efficiency of better than 5.0 mW/Gbps per data link at 12.8 Gbps.},

abstract={On-chip DC-DC converters have the potential to offer fine-grain power management in modern chip-multiprocessors. This paper presents a fully integrated 3-level DC-DC converter, a hybrid of buck and switched-capacitor converters, implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology. The 3-level converter enables smaller inductors (1 nH) than a buck, while generating a wide range of output voltages compared to a 1/2 mode switched-capacitor converter. The test-chip prototype delivers up to 0.85 A load current while generating output voltages from 0.4 to 1.4 V from a 2.4 V input supply. It achieves 77% peak efficiency at power density of 0.1 W/mm2 and 63% efficiency at maximum power density of 0.3 W/mm2. The converter scales output voltage from 0.4 V to 1.4 V (or vice-versa) within 20 ns at a constant 450 mA load current. A shunt regulator reduces peak-to-peak voltage noise from 0.27 V to 0.19 V under pseudo-randomly fluctuating load currents. Using simulations across a wide range of design parameters, the paper compares conversion efficiencies of the 3-level, buck and switched-capacitor converters.},

The 60-GHz outphasing transmitter is optimized for high output power and peak power-added efficiency (PAE) while maintaining sufficient linearity. The chip occupies an active area of 0.33 mm2 and consumes 217 mW from a 1-V supply voltage, delivering 15.6-dBm linear output power with 25% PAE (PA).

abstract={In this paper, a low-noise cascaded PLL is proposed where an integer-N digital bang-bang PLL is used to multiply a 50 MHz reference to an 800 MHz clock that is fed to a ΔΣ fractional-N PLL to generate 2.55-to-3 GHz output. In order to minimize the jitter of the 800 MHz clock, a reference injection scheme using dual-pulse ring oscillator is employed. Quantization noise from the delta-sigma modulator is suppressed without any noise cancellation techniques owing to the high operating frequency of the fractional-N PLL. Prototype implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS process achieves the worst-case RMS jitter of 356 fsrms over 100 Hz to 40 MHz integration bandwidth, while consuming 14.2 mW from a 1.2 V supply. The worst-case fractional spur measured over 7 different chips is -53.9 dBc and the reference spur is -84 dBc.},

abstract={A 65-nm energy-efficient power management with frequency-based control (FBC) is proposed to achieve the near-optimum dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) in a system-on-chip system. Since DVS and dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) operations are demanded for system processor, control loop of the proposed single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) power module is merged with the frequency-controlled phase-locked loop (PLL) to constitute the operation of hybrid control loop. This means that both DVS and DFS operations can be guaranteed and are not affected by process, supply voltage, and temperature variations. The proposed power management can receive the demand of system processor by hybrid control loop and can help realize the supply voltage with different operation tasks for near-optimum DVS operation. The fabricated chip occupies a 1.12-mm2 silicon area. Experimental results show that the SIDO power module achieves a peak efficiency of 90% and the highest power reduction of 33% with the proposed near-optimum DVS operation.},

A repair scheme based on a single-ended 7T SRAM has features such as a local differential write and shared control with the main 2T1C array.

abstract={This paper describes a GaN monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) cascode feedback amplifier design which achieves up to 8 W of output power and greater than +51 dBm OIP3 across a 250-3000-MHz decade bandwidth. The LNA also achieves 20 dB of flat-gain across the band. The design was fabricated with a 0.25-μm GaN HEMT technology with an fT ~ 50 GHz and a BVgd >; 60 V. A 40-V 750-mA high-bias LNA design achieves an OIP3 of 51.9 dBm, P1dB of 38.5 dBm, and NF ~ 3 dB at 2 GHz . A 40-V 500-mA medium-bias LNA design achieves a lower NF ~ 2.5 dB , an OIP3 of 48.4 dBm, and a P1dB of 36.8 dBm at the same frequency. At an optimum low-noise bias of 20 V and 300 mA, a NF ~ 0.96 dB, an OIP3 of 43.4 dBm, and a linear P1dB of ~32.2 dBm was also obtained. The combination of high OIP3 and low NF from these GaN MMIC LNA designs exceed that achieved by many state-of-the-art PHEMT, HBT, and HFET technologies for decade-BW MMIC amplifiers operating in the popular wireless and wire-line S- and C-band frequency ranges. The linear GaN LNA performance demonstrated here can enable new generations of software-defined and reconfigurable radios which require ultra-linearity over multiple octaves of bandwidth.},

The design reuses the SAR ADC to perform offset cancellation, thus saving calibration costs. The inter-stage gain of 8 is implemented in a 6-bit capacitive DAC with a flip-around operation. A capacitive attenuation used in both the first and second DACs significantly reduces the power dissipation and optimizes conversion speed. The detailed circuit implementation of the subthreshold op-amp is discussed, and the possible limits caused by nonidealities are analyzed for a proper correction in the design. These include the inter-stage-gain error and various channel mismatches of offset, gain, and timing.

abstract={This paper proposes a 55 nm CMOS 12-bit current-steering video digital-to-analog converter (DAC) directly powered by the single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) switching converter to compose a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) system and improve the power efficiency. Dual-DVS control in both digital and analog circuits can effectively reduce power consumption. With various supply voltages, the video DAC can meet several different specifications in the power optimized (PO) mode. Furthermore, for DAC, the proposed 3S method, including finger separating, splitting and shifting, achieves good differential nonlinearity (DNL) performance to 0.78/0.4 least significant bit (LSB) and integral nonlinearity (INL) 1.3/1.0 LSB (with/without SIDO converter) without additional calibration. It also suppresses the switching noise interference from the SIDO converter. Moreover, for SIDO converter, the cross-regulation performance is greatly improved in both transient and steady state to achieve lowest interference for the analog supply. The total power efficiency can be improved up to 11.5% and 28% in the DVS and the PO mode. The SIDO supplied DAC with the dual-DVS function achieves 69.88 dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) at the 1 V output swing and 1 MHz input. The proposed intrinsic 12-bit DAC and SIDO converter achieve high definition video DAC performance with the benefit of area and energy efficiency.},

title={A Highly Parallel and Scalable CABAC Decoder for Next Generation Video Coding}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={1}, 
pages={8-22}, 
abstract={Future video decoders will need to support high resolutions such as Quad Full HD (QFHD, 4096 × 2160) and fast frame rates (e.g., 120 fps). Many of these decoders will also reside in portable devices. Parallel processing can be used to increase the throughput for higher performance (i.e., processing speed), which can be traded-off for lower power with voltage scaling. The next generation standard called High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which is being developed as a successor to H.264/AVC, not only seeks to improve the coding efficiency but also to account for implementation complexity and leverage parallelism to meet future power and performance demands. This paper presents a silicon prototype for a pre-standard algorithm developed for HEVC (“H.265”) called Massively Parallel CABAC (MP-CABAC) that addresses a key video decoder bottleneck. A scalable test chip is implemented in 65-nm and achieves a throughput of 24.11 bins/cycle, which enables it to decode the max H.264/AVC bit-rate (300 Mb/s) with only a 18 MHz clock at 0.7 V, while consuming 12.3 pJ/bin. At 1.0 V, it decodes a peak of 3026 Mbins/s for a bit-rate of 2.3 Gb/s, enough for QFHD at 186 fps. Both architecture and joint algorithm-architecture optimizations used to reduce critical path delay, area cost and memory size are discussed.},

abstract={In the effort to achieve low access energy non-volatile memory, challenges are encountered in sensing data at low power supply voltage. This work presents the design of a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) as a promising candidate for this need. The challenges of sensing diminishingly small charge and developing circuits compatible with the scaling of FRAM technology to low voltage and more advanced CMOS nodes are addressed with a time-to-digital sensing scheme. In this work, the 1T1C bitcell signal is analyzed, the circuits for a TDC-based sensing network are presented, and the implementation and operation details of a 1 Mb chip are described.

abstract={A light-weighted body area network using 3-layer coin-sized fabric patches is proposed for sleep monitoring systems. It consists of two ICs, a network controller (NC) and a sensor node (SN), and also Wearable Band (W-Band) to connect them.

Based on this protocol, Linked List based network Manager (LLM) and Adaptive Dual Mode Controller (ADMC) in NC, and low swing data transmitter (D-TX) and its own back-end circuits are introduced. The LLM and ADMC can adaptively change the network configuration according to the dynamic network variances in real-time ( <;500 ms), and D-TX can make low energy data transmitter of 0.33 pJ/b with 20 Mbps data rate for W-Band interface.

year={2012},

pages={3220-3231}, 
abstract={This paper presents the design of a 19-Gb/s serial link receiver with both 4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) and 5-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), thereby making the equalization system self-contained in the receiver. This design extends existing power-efficient DFEs based on current-integrating summers and adds FFE functionality to the DFE circuit infrastructure for an efficient implementation. Key techniques for implementing receive-side FFE are: the use of multiphase quarter-rate sample-and-hold circuits for generating multiple time-shifted input data signals, time-based analog multiplication for FFE coefficient weighting, and a merged FFE/DFE summer. The receiver test chip, implemented in a 45-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology, occupies 0.07 mm2 and has a power efficiency of 6.2 mW/Gb/s at 19 Gb/s. Step-reponse characterization of the receiver demonstrates accurate FFE computation. The receiver equalizes a 35-in PCB trace at 17 Gb/s with a channel loss of 30 dB at 8.5 GHz and a 20-in PCB trace at 19 Gb/s with a channel loss of 25 dB at 9.5 GHz.},

It achieves an ENOB of 11 bits and consumes 1.7 mW from a 1.2 V supply. In the second MASH TDC, a delay-line assisted calibration technique is introduced to mitigate the phase skew caused by the large comparator delay, which is the main limiting factor of the MASH TDC's resolution. The demonstrated TDC achieves an ENOB of 13 bits and a wide input range of 100 ns. This TDC shows a temperature coefficient of 176 ppm°C within a temperature range of -20 to 120°C. It consumes only 0.7 mW and occupies 0.08 mm2 area (core).},

abstract={A small-size on-chip transformer-based digital isolator for power control systems is proposed. With a proposed pulse generation and detection scheme that enables a 5 V standard CMOS transistor to utilize GHz-band signals, transformer area is reduced to 1/4-1/8 that of conventional transformers. A test chip achieves a 2.5 kV isolation voltage, a 35 kV/us CMR, a 1.6 mA static current and a 250 Mbps data rate, all which are equal to or superior to those of optocouplers or conventional digital isolators. The developed technology greatly reduces the number of chips in power control systems by allowing integration of multiple isolators in a CMOS chip together with microcontrollers or gate drivers. Moreover, the high-speed low-power capability expands the application potential to include isolated serial links, controller area network (CAN), FlexRay, medical devices, displays, sensors, etc.},

title={Cross Feedforward Cascode Compensation for Low-Power Three-Stage Amplifier With Large Capacitive Load}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2227-2234}, 
abstract={An area-efficient cross feedforward cascode compensation (CFCC) technique is presented for a three-stage amplifier. The proposed amplifier is capable of driving heavy capacitive load at low power consumption but not dedicated to heavy load currents or heavy resistive loading. The CFCC technique enables the nondominant complex poles of the amplifier to be located at high frequencies, resulting in bandwidth extension. The amplifier can be stabilized with a cascode compensation capacitor of only 1.15 pF when driving a 500-pF capacitive load, greatly reducing the overall area of the amplifier. In addition, the presence of two left-hand-plane (LHP) zeros in the proposed scheme improves the phase margin and relaxes the stability criteria. The proposed technique has been implemented and fabricated in a UMC 65-nm CMOS process and it achieves a 2-MHz gain-bandwidth product (GBW) when driving a 500-pF capacitive load by consuming only 20.4 μW at a 1.2-V supply. The proposed compensation technique compares favorably in terms of figures-of-merit (FOM) to previously reported works. Most significantly, the CFCC amplifier achieves the highest load capacitance to total compensation capacitance ratio (CL/CT) of all its counterparts.},

pages={3130-3144}, 
abstract={Co-existence problems in a mobile terminal environment pose strict requirements on the linearity of a front-end receiver. In this paper, active feedback is explored as a means to relax such requirements by providing channel selectivity as early as possible in the receiver chain. The proposed receiver architecture addresses some of the most common problems of integrated RF filters, while maintaining their inherent tunability. Through a simplified and intuitive analysis, the operation of the receiver is examined and the design parameters affecting the filter characteristics, such as bandwidth and stopband rejection, are determined. A systematic procedure for analyzing the linearity of the receiver reveals the possibility of LNA distortion canceling, which decouples the trade-off between noise, linearity and harmonic radiation. A prototype designed in a standard 65 nm CMOS process occupies <;0.06 mm2 and utilizes an RF channel-select filter with a 1 to 2.5 GHz tunable center frequency to achieve 48 dB of stopband rejection and a wideband IIP3 >; +12 dBm.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={1}, 
pages={85-96}, 
abstract={Highly reliable and low power solid-state drive (SSD) is proposed. Through the analysis based on measured error rate in the SSDs with NAND flash memories, the memory cell error shows the asymmetric characteristic in multilevel cell (MLC) NAND flash memories. The proposed asymmetric coding increases the number of “1” s or “0” s of the programming data to reduce the data retention error. The numbers of the memory cells in the higher VTH states are reduced. The memory cell error is reduced by 90% with the asymmetric coding. On the other hand, the inter bit-line capacitance significantly increases with the scaling of memory cells. The bit-line charging current becomes unacceptably large. To decrease the write power consumption, the stripe pattern elimination algorithm (SPEA) is proposed. The SPEA eliminates the column-stripe pattern which consumes the maximum power to charge all of the inter bit-line capacitance in a NAND chip. Theoretical analyses are given for both the asymmetric coding and the SPEA. The asymmetric coding and the SPEA can be used together with the other highly reliable or low power techniques such as intelligent interleaving and adaptive code selection scheme and realizes the high reliability and low power consumption.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2604-2613}, 
abstract={The design of a ternary successive approximation (TSAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with quantization time information utilization is proposed. The TSAR examines the transient information of a typical dynamic SAR voltage comparator to provide accuracy, speed, and power benefits. Full half-bit redundancy is shown, allowing for residue shaping which provides an additional 6 dB of signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR). Synchronous quantizer speed enhancements allow for a shorter worst case conversion time. An increased monotonicity switching algorithm, stage skipping due to reference grouping, and SAR logic modifications minimize overall dynamic energy. The architecture has been shown to reduce capacitor array switching power consumption and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) driver power by about 60% in a mismatch limited SAR, reduce comparator activity by about 20%, and require only 8.03 average comparisons and 6.53 average DAC movements for a 10-b ADC output word. A prototype is fabricated in 0.13-μm CMOS employing on-chip statistical time reference calibration, supply variability from 0.8 to 1.2 V, and small input signal power scaling. The chip consumes 84 μ W at 8 MHz with an effective number of bits of 9.3 for a figure of merit of 16.9 fJ/C-S for the 10-b prototype and 10.0 fJ/C-S for a 12-b enhanced prototype chip.},

abstract={This paper presents a design methodology for power and area minimization of flexible FFT processors. The methodology is based on the power-area tradeoff space obtained by adjusting algorithm, architecture, and circuit variables. Radix factorization is the main technique for achieving high energy efficiency with flexibility, followed by architecture parallelism and delay line circuits. The flexibility is provided by reconfigurable processing units that support radix-2/4/8/16 factorizations. As a proof of concept, a 128- to 2048-point FFT processor for 3GPP-LTE standard has been implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process. The processor designed for minimum power-area product is integrated in 1.25 × 1.1 mm2 and dissipates 4.05 mW at 0.45 V for the 20 MHz LTE bandwidth. The energy dissipation ranging from 2.5 to 103.7 nJ/FFT for 128 to 2048 points makes it the lowest energy flexible FFT.},

abstract={A four-phase integrated buck converter in 45 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology is presented. The controller uses unlatched pulse-width modulation (PWM) with nonlinear gain to provide both stable small-signal dynamics and fast response (~700 ps) to large input and output transients. This fast control approach reduces the required output capacitance by 5× in comparison to a conventional, latched PWM controller at a similar operating point. The converter switches package-integrated air-core inductors at 80 MHz and delivers 1 A/mm2 at 83% efficiency and 0.66 conversion ratio. A network-on-chip (NoC) serves as a realistic digital load along with a programmable current source capable of generating load current steps with slew rate of ~1 A/100 ps for characterization of the control scheme.},

abstract={A frequency-locked loop (FLL) based spread-spectrum clock generator (SSCG) with a memoryless Newton-Raphson modulation profile is introduced in this paper. The SSCG uses an FLL as a main clock generator. It brings not only an area reduction to the SSCG but also the advantage of having multiple frequency deviations. A double binary-weighted DAC is proposed that modulates the frequency information of the frequency detector using a 1-1-1 MASH ΔΣ modulator. The Newton-Raphson mathematical algorithm is applied to the proposed profile generator in order to generate the optimized nonlinear profile without needing any memory, resulting in a reduction in the area and the power consumption. It also makes it possible to have multiple modulation frequencies. The SSCG can support 14 frequency deviations of ±0.5% to 3.5% in steps of 0.5% and three modulation frequencies of fm, 2 fm and 3 fm. It achieved an EMI reduction of 19.14 dB with a 0.5% down spreading and a 31 kHz modulation frequency, while employing a core area of 0.076 mm2 in a 0.13-μm CMOS process and consuming 23.72 mW at 3.5 GHz.},

pages={1355-1368}, 
abstract={An Li-ion battery charger based on a charge-control buck regulator operating at 2.2 MHz is implemented in 180 nm CMOS technology. The novelty of the proposed charge-control converter consists of regulating the average output current by only sensing a portion of the inductor current and using an adaptive reference voltage. By adopting this approach, the charger average output current is set to a constant value of 900 mA regardless of the battery voltage variation. In constant-voltage (CV) mode, a feedback loop is established in addition to the preexisting current control loop, preserving the smoothness of the output voltage at the transition from constant-current (CC) to CV mode. A small-signal model has been developed to analyze the system stability and subharmonic oscillations at low current levels. Transistor-level simulations of the proposed switching charger are presented. The output voltage ranges from 2.1 to 4.2 V, and the power efficiency at 900 mA has been measured to be 86% for an input voltage of 10 V. The accuracy of the output current using the proposed sensing technique is 9.4% at 10 V.},

abstract={A new wake-up receiver is proposed to reduce energy consumption and latency through adoption of two different data rates for the transmission of wake-up packets. To reduce the energy consumption, the start frame bits (SFBs) of a wake-up packet are transmitted at a low data rate of 1 kbps, and a bit-level duty cycle is employed for detection of SFBs. To reduce both energy consumption and latency, duty cycling is halted upon detection of the SFB sequence, and the rest of the wake-up packet is transmitted at a higher data rate of 200 kbps. The proposed wake-up receiver is designed and fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology with a core size of 1850×1560 μm for the target frequency range of 902-928 MHz. The measured results show that the proposed design achieves a sensitivity of -73 dBm, while dissipating an average power of 8.5 μW from a 1.8 V supply.},

A simple model of the receiver provides intuition on the effects of wiring and photodiode capacitance, and leads to a photodiode-splitting technique enabling improved sensitivity at higher data rates. The receiver is characterized in situ and shown to operate with μA-sensitivity at 3.5 Gb/s with a power consumption of 180 μ W (52 fJ/bit) and area of 108 μm2 .

abstract={This paper presents a low-power receiver with two-tap decision feedback equalization (DFE) and novel far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation capability, implemented in a 45-nm SOI CMOS process. The receiver employs a half-rate speculative DFE architecture to allow for the use of low-power front-end circuitry and CMOS clock buffers. In the proposed architecture, a switched-capacitor sample-hold at the front-end is employed to perform DFE tap summation. This technique is generalized to implement n taps of equalization. The receiver compensates the effect of crosstalk without making a decision on the received aggressor signal. Due to the low-power nature of the switched-capacitor front-end, the crosstalk cancellation is possible with only 33 μW/Gbps/lane power overhead. The receiver was tested over channels with different levels of loss and coupling. The signaling rate with BER <; 10-12 was significantly increased with the use of DFE and crosstalk cancellation scheme for highly coupled and lossy PCB traces. The DFE receiver equalizes 15-Gb/s data over a channel with more than 14-dB loss while consuming about 7.5 mW from a 1.2-V supply. At lower data rates it equalizes channels with over 21-dB loss.},

abstract={An energy-efficient wireless body-area-network (WBAN) transceiver is implemented in 0.18-μm CMOS technology with 1-V supply voltage. For the low energy consumption, the body channel communication (BCC) PHY is utilized with the theoretical results of Maxwell's equation analysis behind the BCC. Based on the channel analysis, the resonance matching (RM) and contact impedance sensing (CIS) techniques are proposed to enhance the quality of the body channel. A double-FSK modulation scheme is adopted with high scalability to fulfill the IEEE 802.15.6 Task Group specifications. In addition, a low-power double-FSK transceiver is implemented by five circuit techniques: 1) a reconfigurable LNA with CIS; 2) a current-reuse wideband demodulator; 3) a divider-based local oscillator (LO) generation with duty-cycle correction in the receiver; 4) a reconfigurable driver with RM; and 5) a divider-based digital double-FSK modulator in the transmitter. As a result, fully WBAN compatible receiver and transmitter consume 2.4 and 2 mW, respectively, at a data rate of 10 Mb/s, corresponding to energy consumption of 0.24 nJ per received bit and 0.2 nJ per transmitted bit.},

abstract={A highly integrated ultra-low-cost high-performance Bluetooth 3.0+EDR SoC is implemented in 0.11-μm digital CMOS technology. The transceiver has an integrated balun shared between TX and RX, eliminating the need for a separate T/R switch. A 4 × LO-based VCO is implemented to reduce LO pulling and to minimize TX out-of-band spurious emissions. The transmitter provides high output power of +10 and +7 dBm in BDR and EDR3 modes respectively, with 1.5-kHz frequency stability and <; 6% rms DEVM. The receiver sensitivity is -95.5, - 96.5, and -89 dBm for BDR, EDR2, and EDR3 modes respectively. Total SoC DC current consumption for continuous TX transmission at +10 dBm output power is 48 mA and for continuous RX reception at reference sensitivity level is 35 mA. Total die size is 5.7 mm2, of which 1.8 mm2 is occupied by RF, analog, and PMU circuits.},

pages={652-664}, 
abstract={Frequency synthesizers based on sub-harmonic injection-locked oscillators can reduce power and area effectively. However, they suffer from unwanted side-bands caused by undesirable harmonics in the injection pulse. This paper presents a pulse shaping technique that reduces these undesirable harmonics in the injection pulse and produces low-spur synthesized output. The robustness of the proposed technique and the impact of circuit non-idealities are also discussed in depth. A test chip tailored to the first band group of WiMedia UWB is fabricated in 0.13-μm CMOS technology to verify the effectiveness of this technique. Experimental results show that the proposed pulse shaping attenuates the spurs by 22 dB and suppresses them below - 47 dBc. The prototype achieves a switching time of less than 4.7 ns and phase noise of -122 dBc/Hz@1 MHz offset at 4.488 GHz. The chip occupies an active area of 0.15 mm2 and draws only 18 mA from a 1.2-V supply.},

abstract={In this paper, a linear CMOS power amplifier (PA) with high output power (34-dBm saturated output power) for high data-rate mobile applications is introduced. The PA incorporates a parallel combination of four differential PA cores to generate high output power with good efficiency and linearity. To implement an efficient on-chip power combiner in a small form-factor, we propose a parallel-series combining transformer (PSCT), which mitigates drawbacks and limitations of conventional power-combining transformers such as a series combining transformer (SCT) and a parallel combining transformer (PCT). Using the proposed PSCT, a two-stage class-AB PA is designed and fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology. The PA achieves a P1dB of 31.5 dBm , a Psat of 34 dBm, and a Plinear of 23.5 dBm with a peak PAE of 34.9% (peak drain efficiency of 41%) at the operating frequency of 2.4 GHz . A detailed analysis of the proposed PSCT is introduced along with comparisons to the conventional monolithic power-combining transformers. A design methodology of the integrated CMOS PA is also presented.},

pages={884-896}, 
abstract={A source synchronous I/O system based on high-density silicon carrier interconnects is introduced. Benefiting from the advantages of advanced silicon packaging technologies, the system uses 50 μm-pitch μC4s to reduce I/O cell size and fine-pitch interconnects on silicon carrier to achieve record-breaking interconnect density. An I/O architecture is introduced with link redundancy such that any link can be taken out of service for periodic recalibration without interrupting data transmission. A timing recovery system using two phase rotators shared across all bits in a receive bus is presented. To demonstrate these concepts, an I/O chipset using this architecture is fabricated in 45 nm SOI CMOS technology. It includes compact DFE-IIR equalization in the receiver, as well as a new all-CMOS phase rotator. The chipset is mounted to a silicon carrier tile via Pb-free SnAg μ C4 solder bumps. Chip-to-chip communication is achieved over ultra-dense interconnects with pitches of between 8 μm and 22 μm. 8 × 10-Gb/s data is received over distances up to 4 cm with a link energy efficiency of 5.3 pJ/bit from 1 V TX and RX power supplies. 8 × 9-Gb/s data is recovered from a 6-cm link with 16.3 dB loss at 4.5 GHz with an efficiency of 6.1 pJ/bit.},

abstract={Processors for next generation mobile devices will need to operate across a wide supply voltage range in order to support both high performance and high power efficiency modes of operation. However, the effects of local transistor threshold (VT) variation, already a significant issue in today's advanced process technologies, and further exacerbated at low voltages, complicate the task of designing reliable, manufacturable systems for ultra-low voltage operation. In this paper, we describe a 4-issue VLIW DSP system-on-chip (SoC), which operates at voltages from 1.0 V down to 0.6 V. The SoC was implemented in 28 nm CMOS, using a cell library and SRAMs optimized for both high-speed and low-voltage operating points. A new statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) methodology was also used on this design, in order to more accurately model the effects of local VT variation and achieve a reliable design with minimal pessimism.},

abstract={This paper presents an energy efficient successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for biomedical applications. To reduce energy consumption, a bypass window technique is used to select switching sequences to skip several conversion steps when the signal is within a predefined small window. The power consumptions of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC), latch comparator, and digital control circuit of the proposed ADC are lower than those of a conventional SAR ADC. The proposed bypass window tolerates the DAC settling error and comparator voltage offset in the first four phases and suppresses the peak DNL and INL values. A proof-of-concept prototype was fabricated in 0.18-μm 1P6M CMOS technology. At a 0.6-V supply voltage and a 200-kS/s sampling rate, the ADC achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio of 57.97 dB and consumes 1.04 μW, resulting in a figure of merit of 8.03 fJ/conversion-step.

year={2012},

number={4}, 
pages={863-874}, 
abstract={A dual-loop architecture employs eight distributed microregulators (UREGs) to achieve load response times below 500 ps in 45-nm SOI CMOS. The trip point of an asynchronous comparator inside each UREG is tuned for high DC accuracy with a local charge pump, which receives UP/DOWN currents from a slow outer feedback loop. The feedback through the charge pumps also ensures balanced load sharing among the UREGs. Two techniques are introduced to reduce the output ripple generated by switching the pMOS passgate on and off: hybrid fast/slow passgate control (in which the DC portion of the load current is supplied by a parallel output device with slew-rate-limited gate drive) and pMOS strength calibration (which adjusts the active width of the passgate to compensate for PVT variations). The distributed regulator system is integrated into a DDR3 I/O core and supplies power to CMOS delay lines used for clock-to-data deskewing. Each of the eight UREGs is sized to provide up to 5.3 mA of load current and occupies an area of 55 × 60 μm2. The measured DC load regulation is better than 10 mV down to an 85-mV dropout voltage. Jitter readings of the CMOS delay lines indicate output noise close to 28 mVpp.},

abstract={A digital outphasing transmitter is presented for 2.4-GHz WiFi. The transmitter consists of two delay-based phase modulators and a 26-dBm integrated switching class-D power amplifier. The delay-based phase modulator delays incoming LO edges with a resolution of 1.4 ps (8 bit) required to meet WiFi requirements. A phase MUX architecture is proposed to implement switching between phases once every LO period (2.4 GHz) without generating detrimental glitches at the output. Due to its open-loop nature, the proposed phase modulator is capable of delivering wide OFDM bandwidths up to 40 MHz. The paper analyzes the impact of impairments, e.g., delay mismatch within the delay cells and outphasing mismatches, as well as associated mitigation techniques. The transmitter has been implemented in a 32-nm digital CMOS process and delivers an OFDM average power of 20 dBm with an overall system efficiency of 18.6% when transmitting 54-Mb/s 64QAM signal. The fully digital design is expected to further improve in power dissipation and chip-area with further CMOS scaling.},

Moreover, a newly developed PVT variation- tolerant cascode biasing circuit guarantees highly accurate bias voltages in a wide supply voltage range from 2.5 V to 3.6 V. The test chip demonstrates maximum output power of 28.3 dBm at 1.95 GHz, satisfying 3GPP WCDMA spectrum mask with die area of 5.4 mm2.},

abstract={The maximum sampling rate of a continuous-time ΔΣ modulator in a given process is limited by the minimum flash ADC delay that can be realized. Excess loop delay compensation techniques that are widely used can compensate for delays up to half a clock cycle. Addition of a fast loop outside the flash ADC can break this limit and compensate for one and half clock cycles of delay at the cost of reducing the order of noise shaping by one. This technique, along with a low latency flash ADC, and a delay free calibrated DAC, result in a lowpass continuous-time ΔΣ ADC with the highest reported sampling rate in a 0.18 m process. The prototype occupies 0.68 mm2 , consumes 47.6 mW, and operates at 800 MS/s. In a 16 MHz bandwidth (oversampling ratio of 25), the dynamic range, maximum signal to noise ratio, and maximum signal to noise and distortion ratios are 75 dB, 67 dB, and 65 dB respectively. In a 32 MHz bandwidth, the dynamic range, maximum signal to noise ratio, and maximum signal to noise and distortion ratios are 64 dB, 57 dB, and 57 dB, respectively.},

pages={131-140}, 
abstract={A 512 Mbit consumer DDR2 SDRAM that uses self-dynamic voltage scaling (SDVS) and adaptive design techniques is introduced in this paper. With the increase in the significance of process variation, higher performance requirements reduce the allowable design margin in DRAM circuits. However, self-dynamic voltage scaling gives a greater timing margin in the circuitry by changing the internal supply voltage in response to the operating frequency and process skew. By changing the internal supply voltage, the life time of the chip increases by more than 23 times when the supply voltage is lowered by 300 mV. The proposed adaptive design techniques include an adaptive bandwidth delay-locked loop and an adaptive clock gating. The former improves the performance by obtaining a wider valid data window and the latter saves on dynamic power consumption in the clock distribution network. The SDVS method reduces the IDD3P by 9.3% and the adaptive clock gating saves 8.8% of the IDD3N when measured at 200 MHz, 25°C The studied consumer DDR2 SDRAM was fabricated using 44 nm standard DRAM process technology.

abstract={A wideband (6-20 GHz) Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) adaptive image-reject mixer with an intermediate frequency (IF) of 1.8 GHz is presented. The mixer can be “self-healed” to deliver consistent performance by nullifying the effects of process variations, environmental changes, or aging. Various performance metrics of the mixer can also be adapted to different specifications across multiple frequency bands. A conversion gain greater than 15 dB, an image rejection ratio (IRR) exceeding 35 dB, and an output 1-dB compression point greater than 10 dBm, were obtained in measurement. An automated self-healing procedure is developed and shown to be effective for improving the measured performance of the mixer. The mixer was fabricated in a 150 GHz peak fT, 200 nm SiGe BiCMOS process technology and consumes 215 mA of current operating off a 4 V rail.},

The capacitor pass-on scheme enables operation of the system from an input voltage of 95 mV without using additional off-chip components. To compensate for the die-to-die process variation, post-fabrication threshold voltage (VTH) trimming is applied to reduce the minimum operating voltage (VDDMIN) of the oscillator. Experimental results demonstrate the 34% VDDMIN reduction of the oscillator by post-fabrication VTH trimming. The proposed step-up converter achieves the lowest startup voltage in standard CMOS without using a mechanical switch or large transformer.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS image sensor which captures local incident angle and intensity information from the light it records. The 400×384 pixel array employs 7.5 μm angle-sensitive pixels, which use pairs of local diffraction gratings above a photodiode to detect incident angle. The gratings are implemented with the metal interconnect layers of CMOS manufacturing technology and therefore require no post-processing or external optics. Fabricated in a 180 nm mixed-mode CMOS process, the sensor requires only a single lens to create a light-field image. Using the information contained in a single image, we demonstrate range finding with 2.5 mm precision at 1 m and post-capture refocus on complex visual scenes.},

pages={2627-2642}, 
abstract={We present an 8.0-Gb/s HyperTransport source-synchronous I/O integrated in a 32-nm SOI-CMOS processor for high-performance servers. Based on a 45-nm design capping at 6.4 Gb/s, the 32-nm transceiver achieves up to 8.0 Gb/s over long-reach board channels by incorporating several jitter- and power-reduction enhancements. First, a high-bandwidth digital clean-up PLL is introduced to attenuate high-frequency jitter in the received forwarded clock before the data is sampled. This PLL achieves a highly programmable jitter bandwidth of 20-296 MHz (measured with 0.2 UIpp input jitter) and 0.90-1.50 ps output rms jitter by implementing an extended bang-bang phase detector for additional phase-error magnitude information and flexible bang-bang control of a current-starved ring-based oscillator. Second, several power-hungry circuits, namely the transmitter input FIFO and output driver as well as the receiver deserializer, are redesigned for 8.0-Gb/s operation to maintain thermal compatibility with the existing 45-nm socket package. The fabricated 20-lane I/O consumes 1.70 W at 8.0 Gb/s with an energy efficiency of 11.8 pJ/bit. This reflects a 4.9% increase in HyperTransport power consumption and only 0.3% increase in total processor target power relative to 45-nm operation at 6.4 Gb/s.},

year={2012},

abstract={We present a field-programmable analog array designed for accurate low-power mixed-signal computation. This 25-mm2 350 nm-CMOS reconfigurable analog IC incorporates digital enhancements to increase compatibility in embedded mixed-signal systems. The chip contains 78 computational analog blocks (CABs) which house a variety of processing elements. There are 36 general CABs with hundreds of common analog primitives for computation, 18 digital-to-analog converter (DAC) CABs, each with 8-b compilable DAC capabilities, and 24 vector-matrix multiplier CABs, for low-power parallel processing. A floating-gate routing matrix connects these analog elements to one another, both within individual CABs and between CABs. To facilitate digital interfacing and dynamic reconfigurability, we included a novel network of volatile switches based on digital shift and select registers that control analog switches. These dynamically controlled switches span all of the rows and columns of the internal routing, allowing for run-time system modification and scanning I/O. The digital registers can also double as on-chip memory. We introduce a new hybrid floating-gate switch matrix, which includes switches that eliminate previously observed mismatch issues to provide highly precise computation. To highlight the potential of this digitally enhanced analog processor, we demonstrate a dynamically reconfigurable image transformer, an arbitrary waveform generator, and a mixed-signal FIR filter.},

In double-sampling pipelined ADC architecture, memory effect of residual charge occurs due to sharing an op-amp between two channels of pipelined ADC. The proposed foreground calibration technique removes the memory effect error in digital domain without additional analog circuit. Thus, the technique simplifies the analog circuits, which extends the operation speed over 300 MHz. The chip is fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS and occupies 0.42 mm2 including digital calibration logic.

abstract={Class-D amplifiers for portable devices are now demanding more than 2 W 1% THD output power on 8 Ω speakers in smartphone and tablet for a better multi-media user experience. However higher acoustic power brings a lot of additional constraints such as speaker damage, more EMI energy and battery reset. The presented paper demonstrates a 2.5 W 1% THD into 8 Ω Class-D amplifier with 104 dB(A) dynamic range using a new power stage architecture to reduce silicon area. The design includes a ULEMI system to reduce high frequency energy without impact on audio band noise and an embedded load current sensing for speaker protection algorithm.},

abstract={A DCO is realized in 0.13 μm CMOS using 4 cores for a 5.6 to 11.5 GHz octave tuning bandwidth to provide the clock for an all digital D/PLL CDR circuit. The DCO is novel in that it can track more than a 130 degree C temperature variation while the CDR maintains an error free lock to data. Each core is directly coupled to a div/2 to produce I/Q signals that a 4:1 MUX combines into a single set of 2.8 to 5.8 GHz quadrature outputs to drive the sine interpolator of the CDR. Locked to maximum data rms jitter, integrated from 1 kHz to 1 GHz is 299 fs @ 9.953 Gb/s (Sonet OC-192) from a DCO phase noise of -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The KDCO gain is 190 ppm/bit with less than 2:1 variation over the full bandwidth. The combined DCO, divide by 2 and MUX current is 14 mA to 37 mA on a 1.2 V regulated supply at 25°C.},

abstract={An ultra-low-power, low-voltage frequency synthesizer designed for implantable medical devices is presented. Several design techniques are adopted to address the issues in ultra-low voltage and current design. The charge pump (CP) in the synthesizer utilizes dynamic threshold-voltage and switch-coupled techniques to provide a high driving current with a low standby current. The synthesizer adopts a ring-based voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) that utilizes a dual resistor-varactor tuning technique to compensate for process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations and the exponential voltage-to-current curve. Implemented in a 0.13-μm CMOS technology, the 0.5-V medical-band frequency synthesizer consumes 440 μW while exhibiting a phase noise of 91.5 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz frequency offset.},

abstract={A 100 W, 5.1-channel, single-chip, digital-input class-D audio amplifier with a low-voltage (LV) digital circuit and high-voltage (HV) switching power stage is designed for moderate-performance and cost-effective speaker systems. The LV portion, including multi-channel audio processors, delta-sigma modulators (DSMs), and pulse-width modulation (PWM) generators, is implemented with a standard CMOS digital cell-library. A dual-loop resonator is proposed to increase the stable input range of the DSM so that the low-distortion output power of the class-D amplifier can be increased. For the HV portion, distortion caused by parasitic resistances of the power stage is analyzed to obtain a better design. A multi-phase PWM switching technique is proposed to prevent the multi-channel output stages from simultaneously switching, and thus the supply bouncing can be reduced. An over-current protection circuit with high supply noise immunity is also presented. Fabricated with 0.35/3-μm 3.3/18-V 1P3M CMOS technology, the 5.1-channel amplifier achieves a total root-mean-square (RMS) output power of 100 W, a distortion of less than 0.7%, and a power efficiency of 88% with a total chip area of 48.9 mm2.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={1}, 
pages={61-74}, 
abstract={In this paper, we present a low-power high-performance WiMAX chipset fully compliant with IEEE 802.16e specification corrigendum 1, 2 for mobile broadband access and WiMAX Forum system profile Wave2. The chipset is comprised of a 632.7-mW/24.99-mm2 modem/router chip and a 364-mW/11.05- mm2 dual-band 2 × 2 MIMO RF transceiver chip, both developed in 65-nm CMOS process. The proposed chipset is capable of handling a maximum peak WiMAX downlink (DL) throughput of 70 Mbps. Moreover, the chipset can reach up to -100.5-dBm sensitivity in a 10-MHz AWGN channel, which outperforms WiMAX Forum mobile radio conformance test (MRCT) by 9.5 dB. Such high sensitivity is due to the proposed low-noise high-linearity RF transceiver chip, which has 2.5-dB RX noise figure (NF) and -37-dB TX error vector magnitude (EVM), and the applied high-performance baseband signal processing algorithms. Several low-power design techniques-from SW level, firmware/DSP level, to HW module level-have been implemented to enable portable applications. The modem/router chip is highly integrated and has rich features and various interfaces for applications such as router or VoIP phone. Furthermore, this is the only published WiMAX chipset which has been in mass production.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2964-2973}, 
abstract={A wideband feedback linearization technique for a power amplifier (PA), PA-closed loop, is presented. In order to achieve wideband operation, it employs a two-path feedback scheme where the input and output phases and amplitudes are detected at RF and compared to directly control and linearize the PA. The wideband characteristic of the loop suppressed the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) for WCDMA standard by 6 dB. The advantage of the feedback is demonstrated by measuring the performance against the load variation. The required back-off is degraded by only 1 dB with a voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) of 1.5, whereas it is 3 dB without the loop. The loop consumes 28.3 mW and it reduces the quiescent power consumption of the PA by 78 mW. The chip, which integrates the loop and PA, is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology and the loop occupies 0.3 mm by 0.7 mm. The PA delivers WCDMA output power of 27.1 dBm with a power added efficiency (PAE) of 28% and ACLR of 40 dBc. This topology makes possible the wideband feedback linearization of a watt-level PA.},

title={A Tri-Modal 20-Gbps/Link Differential/DDR3/GDDR5 Memory Interface}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={4}, 
pages={926-937}, 
abstract={This paper describes a tri-modal asymmetric bidirectional differential memory interface that supports data rates of up to 20 Gbps over 3" FR4 PCB channels while achieving power efficiency of 6.1 mW/Gbps at full speed. The interface also accommodates single-ended standard DDR3 and GDDR5 signaling at 1.6-Gbps and 6.4-Gbps operations, respectively, without package change. The compact, low-power and high-speed tri-modal interface is enabled by substantial reuse of the circuit elements among various signaling modes, particularly in the wide-band clock generation and distribution system and the multi-modal driver output stage, as well as the use of fast equalization for post-cursor intersymbol interference (ISI) mitigation. In the high-speed differential mode, the system utilizes a 1-tap transmit equalizer during a WRITE operation to the memory. In contrast, during a memory READ operation, it employs a linear equalizer (LEQ) with 3 dB of peaking as well as a calibrated high-speed 1-tap predictive decision feedback equalizer (prDFE), while no transmitter equalization is assumed for the memory. The prototype tri-modal interface implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, consists of 16 data links and achieves more than 2.5 × energy-efficient memory transactions at 16 Gbps compared to a previous single-mode generation.},

abstract={We introduce a novel frequency tuning method for high-power terahertz sources in CMOS. In this technique, multiple core oscillators are coupled to generate, combine, and deliver their harmonic power to the output node without using varactors. By exploiting the theory of nonlinear dynamics, we control the coupling between the cores to set their phase shift and frequency. Using this method, two high-power terahertz VCOs are fabricated in a 65 nm LP bulk CMOS process. The first one has a measured output power of 0.76 mW at 290 GHz with 4.5% tuning range and the output power of the second VCO is 0.46 mW at 320 GHz with 2.6% tuning range. The output power of these signal sources is 4 orders of magnitude higher than previous CMOS VCOs and is even higher than VCOs implemented in compound semiconductors with much higher cut-off frequencies.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and realization of a gain-programmable microphone audio preamplifier that does not need external input-decoupling capacitors. Three possible preamplifier implementations with on-chip decoupling capacitors have been presented and compared in terms of audio quality performance, power consumption, and silicon area occupation. The chosen solution has been integrated in a 40-nm digital CMOS process with seven metal layers and a double gate-oxide option. Process fringe capacitors have been used to implement the internal decoupling, amplifying, and dc biasing functions. The active area is 0.19 mm2, whereas the power consumption is 330 μ W at a 1.5-V power supply. Measured dynamic range (DR) and maximum signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of approximately 105 dB A-weighted and 101 dB A-weighted, respectively, have been achieved for 0-dB gain and balanced inputs. The preamplifier can process both balanced and single-ended inputs, and its gain can be programmed from 0 to 19.5 dB in 1.5-dB/steps with acceptable performance losses.},

abstract={Prior work has demonstrated a new process utilizing room-temperature liquid metal, Galinstan, as an interconnect material for flip-chip bonding. This interconnect forms a flexible bond between chips and carriers, and, therefore, a flip-chip assembly using this technology is much less susceptible to thermomechanical stresses. This paper applies this concept to interconnect GaAs MMIC chips to 3-D Polystrata transmission-line structures. Passive assemblies are utilized to model, test, and verify liquid-metal interconnections, giving average losses per liquid-metal transition of about 0.11 dB out to 26.5 GHz, low parasitics per transition, and demonstrated reliability after temperature cycling. A prefabricated GaAs MMIC chip is postprocessed for liquid-metal assembly. Measured results show, over the MMIC's 4.9-8.5-GHz frequency range, the system's overall reduction in gain of the MMIC is 1.4 dB or 0.7 dB per RF transition as compared with direct probing of the MMIC chip.},

abstract={High density 48-port network switches demand very power-efficient, small form-factor physical layer transceivers which comply with the transmit PSD and return loss requirements, on the one hand, and meet the FCC Class-A specifications on the other hand, while achieving better than 10E-12 BER. The presented 10GBASE-T transmitter and hybrid utilize a current-mirroring amplifier with output rise-time control and high CMRR to perform a first-order linear and nonlinear echo cancellation while enabling the design of 48-port FCC compliant network switches. Experimental results over the 400-MHz bandwidth exhibit a worst case transmitter linearity of >;57 dBc as well as worst case post-hybrid fundamental and SFDR power of -18 and -70 dBc, respectively, across the 400-MHz frequency range of interest. The echo fundamental component is further attenuated to <; -60 dB in the analog domain by an adaptive mixed-mode echo canceller. Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the transmitter plus hybrid consumes 200 mW power and occupies 0.5 mm2.},

abstract={This paper introduces a novel signaling scheme for parallel high-speed interfaces. The new signaling, called coded differential (CD), maps two bits of information to four wires and, therefore, has the same pin-efficiency as differential signaling. The coding scheme is designed in such a way that the parallel interface preserves many of the attractive properties of a differential link such as low supply noise generation and immunity to common-mode noise. The CD receiver also incorporates differential detection with no need for a dc reference. In addition, the coding completely eliminates the first post-cursor intersymbol interference of the channel over the entire unit-interval at no loss in throughput. As a result, CD leads to substantial increase in timing margin compared with a differential link with 1-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE). Unlike DFE, CD does not require channel tap estimation. The theory of CD signaling, the optimization of the encoder and the decoder, and the implementation details of a prototype system developed based on this scheme for graphics memory interfaces are described. The full-featured interface, implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, transfers 8 × 16 Gb/s data over 16 wires and achieves an energy efficiency of 4.1 pJ/b. Eye diagram measurements on a scope indicate 30% improvement in timing margin compared with a 1-tap predictive DFE system.},

pages={2586-2603}, 
abstract={A high-power-supply-rejection-ratio (PSRR), reconfigurable class-AB/D audio power amplifier is designed for direct battery hookup in portable applications. The proposed design employs the on-chip battery voltage tracking common-mode reference (BAVTCMR) generator and the pseudo-differential topology to achieve the high SNR requirement in a hands-free/receiver 2-in-1 loudspeaker. This amplifier can achieve 106 dB/100 dB PSRR at 217 Hz and 1 kHz, respectively. In receiver mode, this design can drive 46 mW into an 8- Ω load. A true 100-dB SNR is also achieved when a global system for mobile communications (GSM) is generating ripple noise on the system power lines. Reconfiguration is implemented by employing the low-noise operational amplifier (opamp) and capacitors in the class-D integrator as the first gain stage and the compensation capacitors, respectively, in a class-AB amplifier. Hence, the hardware redundancy and the design complexity are both minimized. Fabricated with 0.153-μm CMOS technology, 74-dB/76-dB THD are achieved for class-AB and class-D, respectively. More than 90% efficiency is achieved in class-D mode operation. The maximum output power at 1% THD is 1.23 W. The active area of the prototype class-AB/D amplifier is 0.5 mm2.},

The 10-bit TDC exhibits a timing resolution of 119 ps with a timing uniformity across the entire array of less than 2 LSBs.

abstract={This paper presents a fully autonomous, adaptive pulsed synchronous charge extractor (PSCE) circuit optimized for piezoelectric harvesters (PEHs) which have a wide output voltage range 1.3-20 V. The PSCE chip fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS process is supplied exclusively by the buffer capacitor where the harvested energy is stored in. Due to the low power consumption, the chip can handle a minimum PEH output power of 5.7 μW. The system performs a startup from an uncharged buffer capacitor and operates in the adaptive mode at storage buffer voltages from 1.4 V to 5 V. By reducing the series resistance losses, the implementation of an improved switching technique increases the extracted power by up to 20% compared to the formerly presented Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SECE) technique and enables the chip efficiency to reach values of up to 85%. Compared to a low-voltage-drop passive full-wave rectifier, the PSCE chip increases the extracted power to 123% when the PEH is driven at resonance and to 206% at off-resonance.},

The main contributions of this work are a source-follower-based delay cell with a multiloop ring structure achieving improved supply rejection, a design-oriented analysis of the proposed structure to facilitate its use, and a layout technique allowing straightforward mask design for the multiloop oscillator. The oscillator also features differential control voltages to allow rejection of common-mode control and supply noise. The oscillator was fabricated in a UMC 90-nm CMOS pure logic process with no analog components (regular VT), and the minimum measured incremental supply sensitivity is 0.003 [%-change fosc/%-change VDD], which is more than 20 dB better than that of a conventional CMOS-delay-cell quadrature oscillator fabricated on the same test chip. The oscillator's measured tuning range is 0.63-8.1 GHz. Over the tuning range, the phase noise varies from - 106 to - 88 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset, and the power consumption ranges from 7 to 26 mW from a 1-V supply.

The minimum working voltage of the proposed boost converter is 40 mV with oscillation through a positive feedback loop formed by a native MOS and transformer. The oscillation autonomously starts up by thermal noise and VOUT is charged up to 1.2 V by the oscillation so that the control block can operate. After that, the transformer for start-up is reused as an inductor, and the normal boost converter mode is enabled for better energy transfer efficiency. An improved MPPT sensing method is also proposed to simplify the circuit. The prototype chip is implemented in a 0.13-μm CMOS process.

title={Quad Full-HD Transform Engine for Dual-Standard Low-Power Video Coding}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2724-2736}, 
abstract={Transform engine is a critical part of the video codec, and increased coding efficiency often comes at the cost of increased complexity in the transform module. In this work, we propose a shared transform engine for H.264/AVC and VC-1 video coding standards, using the structural similarity and symmetry of the transforms. An approach to eliminate an explicit transpose memory in 2-D transforms is proposed. Data dependency is exploited to reduce power consumption. Ten different versions of the transform engine, such as with and without hardware sharing and with and without transpose memory, are implemented in the design. The design is fabricated using commercial 45-nm CMOS technology, and all implemented versions are verified. The shared transform engine without transpose memory supports Quad Full-HD (3840 × 2160) video encoding at 30 fps, while operating at 0.52 V, with a measured power of 214 μ W. This highly scalable design is able to support 1080 p at 30 fps, while operating down to 0.41 V, with measured power of 79 μW and 720 p at 30 fps, while operating down to 0.35 V, with measured power of 43 μW. Hardware sharing saves 30% area compared with individual H.264 and VC-1 implementations combined. Eliminating an explicit transpose memory using a 2-D (8 × 8) output buffer reduces area by 23% and power by 26%. Ideas proposed here can potentially be extended to future video coding standards such as HEVC.},

number={2}, 
pages={454-463}, 
abstract={A low-distortion third-order class-D amplifier that is fully integrated into a 0.18-μ m CMOS process was designed for direct battery hookup in a mobile application. A class-D amplifier for direct battery hookup must have a sufficiently high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) in preparation for noise, such as when a global system for mobile communications (GSM) bursts ripples through the system power line. This amplifier has a high PSRR of 88 dB for 217-Hz power supply ripples, using a third-order loop filter. System performance and stability are improved by applying the design technique of input-feedforward delta-sigma (ΔΣ) modulators to the pulse-width modulation (PWM) class-D amplifier. A filterless method that can remove the external LC filter is employed, which offers great advantages in terms of PCB space and system cost. This amplifier achieves a power efficiency of 85.5% while delivering an output power of 750 mW into an 8-Ω load from a 3.7-V supply voltage.

abstract={Presented is a clockless, continuous-time (CT) GHz processor that bypasses some of the limitations of conventional digital and analog implementations. Per-edge digital signal encoding is used for parallel processing of continuous-time samples with a temporal spacing as narrow as 15 ps, generated by a 3-b CT flash ADC. Parallel digital delay chains and programmable charge pumps realize the asynchronous filtering operation, each consuming negligible power while awaiting a new sample. A six-tap CT ADC and CT digital FIR processor system occupies 0.07 mm2 and achieves dynamic range of over 20 dB in the 0.8-3.2-GHz signal range. The system's rate of operations automatically adapts to the signal, thus causing its power dissipation to vary in the range of 1.1 to 10 mW according to input activity.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-power high-bit-rate phase modulator based on a digital PLL with single-bit TDC and two-point injection scheme. At high bit rates, this scheme requires a controlled oscillator with wide tuning range and becomes critically sensitive to the delay spread between the two injection paths, considerably degrading the achievable error-vector magnitude and causing significant spectral regrowth. A multi-capacitor-bank oscillator topology with an automatic background regulation of the gains of the banks and a digital adaptive filter for the delay-spread correction are introduced. The phase modulator fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process synthesizes carriers in the 2.9-to-4.0-GHz range from a 40-MHz crystal reference and it is able to produce a phase change up to ±π with 10-bit resolution in a single reference cycle. Measured EVM at 3.6 GHz is -36 dB for a 10-Mb/s GMSK and a 20-Mb/s QPSK modulation. Power dissipation is 5 mW from a 1.2-V voltage supply, leading to a total energy consumption of 0.25 nJ/bit.},

abstract={A voltage scalable zero-crossing based (ZCB) pipelined ADC built in 65 nm CMOS is described. The highly digital implementation characteristic of the ZCB circuit technique enables energy efficient operation and supply voltage scaling. Several new techniques including the unidirectional coarse-fine charge transfer scheme, programmable ramp rates, and flash resistor ladder scaling, are developed to allow efficient operation at different supply voltages as well as to extend the supply voltage range down to 0.5 V. Two versions, the first fabricated in 65 nm GP (general purpose) technology, and the second in 65 nm LP (low power) technology from an identical design file show similar performance characteristics except for the power supply voltage ranges, demonstrating the robustness of the design. At 1.0 V (GP)/1.2 V (LP) nominal supply and 50 MS/s, the ADC achieves 67.7 dB (GP)/68.1 dB (LP) SNDR after calibration while dissipating 4.07 mW (GP)/4.93 mW (LP), resulting in an FOM of 41.0 fJ/step (GP)/47.5 fJ/step (LP). The supply voltage scalability is demonstrated down to 0.5 V (GP)/0.8 V (LP) and improves the FOM to 28.0 fJ/step (GP)/37.8 fJ/step (LP), while maintaining higher than 66 dB SNDR.},

abstract={This paper presents a high-efficiency broadband envelope-tracking power amplifier with operation at carrier frequencies from 500 to 1750 MHz.

Under single-tone excitation, the Class-AB GaN PA IC provides output power above 12 W with greater than 50% drain efficiency and more than 10-dB gain at 40-V drain bias. When placed in envelope tracking configuration, using a representative WCDMA modulated signal with 4-MHz bandwidth and 6.6-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the ET PA achieved 4 W of average output power at its peak average drain efficiency of 31% at 752 MHz (including the power dissipation of the envelope modulator). The RFPA individually was measured to have an average drain efficiency of 58.5% for the WCDMA signal. Across the 500-1750-MHz band, using the WCDMA signal, greater than 25% average drain efficiency with more than 10 dB of gain was measured.},

title={A Compact Dynamic-Performance-Improved Current-Steering DAC With Random Rotation-Based Binary-Weighted Selection}, 
year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={2}, 
pages={444-453}, 
abstract={Conventional binary-weighted current-steering DACs are generally operated with current groups where each group is binary-weighted and formed with predetermined members of a unit current-source array. This paper proposes a random rotation-based binary-weighted selection (RRBS) that efficiently performs dynamic-element matching (DEM) by randomly rotating the sequence of these units to form new binary-weighted current groups for each DAC output. Without using binary-to-thermometer decoders, RRBS features its simplicity and compactness of DEM realization. Compared to conventional binary-weighted DACs, RRBS DACs are insensitive to the mismatch of small-size current-sources and exhibit better dynamic performance. A 10-bit RRBS DAC is implemented with only 0.034 mm2 in a standard 1P6M 1.8 V 0.18 μm CMOS process. Measured performance achieves >;61 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) in the Nyquist bandwidth with 500 MS/s, while its active area is less than one-tenth of that required by state-of-the-art 10-bit current steering DACs. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed RRBS implements the smallest area for high-speed current-steering DACs up to now. Its SFDR is also comparable to that of 12-bit published designs. Three popular figures-of-merit (FOMs) are used to compare this design with other state-of-the-art 10-12-bit DACs, with the proposed design performing best with 2 FOMs.},

abstract={Emerging nonvolatile memory with an oxide-semiconductor-based thin-film transistor (TFT) using indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) was developed. The memory is called nonvolatile oxide-semiconductor random access memory (NOSRAM). The memory cell of the NOSRAM (NOSRAM cell) consists of an IGZO TFT for data writing, a normal Si-based p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (PMOS) for data reading, and a cell capacitor for storing charge and controlling the PMOS gate voltage. The IGZO TFT and the cell capacitor are formed over the PMOS. Owing to extremely low-leakage-current characteristics of the IGZO TFT, the charge stored in the 2-fF cell capacitor is maintained for a long time. This long data retention realized innovative nonvolatile memory. The NOSRAM cell fabricated with the 0.8-μ m process technology demonstrated an on/off ratio of 107 and an endurance over 1012 write cycles. In addition, NOSRAM with a memory capacity of 1 Mb was fabricated; the cell size was 12.32 μm2 and the cell array size was 13.5 mm2. The 1-Mb NOSRAM achieved basic operation at 4.5 V or less, write operation at 150 ns/page, read distribution of data “1” with 3σ = 0.10 V, and a data retention over 60 days at 85°C.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully digital polar up-converter for wireless transmission in the GHz range. The system is designed to drive two class-E power amplifiers (PAs) with a power combiner. It uses baseband pulse width modulation (PWM) for the amplitude modulation (AM), whereas phase modulation (PM) is implemented by shifting the RF carrier in time. Both the PWM and the PM are implemented using asynchronous delay lines which allow time resolutions down to 10 ps without the need for any reference frequencies higher than the carrier frequency. The system supports a continuous range of carrier frequencies from 946 MHz up to 2.4 GHz. It also supports a continuous range of sampling frequencies, which allows trading off signal quality for PA efficiency. The modulator has been implemented in 65-nm low-power CMOS. Measurements using 64-QAM OFDM signals show error vector magnitude (EVM) values ranging from 1.90% (-34.4 dB) for 5-MHz bandwidth signals at 946 MHz to 6.08% (-24.3 dB) for 20-MHz bandwidth signals at 2.4 GHz.},

abstract={A transformer-combined fully integrated outphasing class-D PA in 45 nm LP CMOS achieves 31.5 dBm peak output power at 2.4 GHz with 27% peak PAE, and supports over 86 dB of output power range. The PA employs dynamic power control (DPC) whereby sections of the PA are turned on or off dynamically according to the instantaneous signal amplitude to reduce power dissipation, especially at back-off. Dynamic on-off switching introduces transients on the power supply that can limit performance. The paper proposes and demonstrates techniques to reduce the impact of such transients. A multi-section slab inductor based transformer combiner is used to allow individual switching of unit PAs. The PA delivers 24.8 dBm average power while meeting 64-QAM WLAN requirements. PAE is 16% when using DPC, which represents a 33% efficiency enhancement compared to the DPC-disabled mode. At lower average power of 20.5 dBm, DPC enables a 140% enhancement in average efficiency, hence increasing battery life.},

abstract={This paper presents a zero-IF Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) demodulator based on a phase-domain analog-to-digital converter (Ph-ADC) which directly quantizes the phase information of the received complex baseband signal. The Ph-ADC linearly combines the in-phase and quadrature parts of the incoming signal, and the generated phase-shifted versions are fed to comparators to detect the zero-crossings and build a 4-b digital representation of the signal phase. Seeking for a low-area and low-power consumption realization, our proposal employs a resistor-less scheme which performs phase rotations in current domain. Together with the Ph-ADC, the fully integrated GFSK demodulator also includes a channel-filtering programmable gain amplifier and a symbol decision block. Altogether, the demodulator occupies 0.14 mm2 in a 0.13- μm CMOS technology with a total power consumption of 190 μW from a 1-V supply. For a data rate of 1 Mbps and 0.5 modulation depth, the GFSK demodulator requires an EB/N0 of 14.8 dB for a bit error rate of 0.1% considering a flicker noise corner of 150 kHz, obtains a dynamic range of 74 dB, and is able to tolerate carrier frequency offsets of ±170 kHz. This performance safely complies with the requirements of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.},

abstract={This paper describes design considerations for a digital inductive-switching DC/DC converter suitable for direct battery connection in a deep sub-micron CMOS process. Digital control techniques and robust circuit design methods take advantage of the advanced process technology while avoiding the barriers to direct battery connection and high efficiency, high power density voltage conversion. The approach is verified on a prototype converter, implemented in 40 nm standard bulk CMOS. The design achieves a peak efficiency of 95% for an input range of up to 5.5 V.

abstract={This paper presents a multimode FFT processor for wireless personal area network (WPAN), wireless local area network (WLAN), and wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) applications. Using the proposed flexible-radix-configuration multipath-delay-feedback (FRCMDF) architecture, variable-length/multiple-stream FFTs capable of achieving a high throughput can be performed in a hardware-efficient manner. Based on the FRCMDF structure, a dual-optimized multiplication scheme is also proposed to further improve the area and energy efficiency. In addition, the proposed configuration scheme can provide an architectural support for power scalability across FFT modes. A test chip for the proposed FFT processor has been designed and fabricated using a TSMC-0.18 m CMOS process with a core size of 3.2 mm^2 and a signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) of over 40 dB. When the FFT mode is configured to operate as a 2.4 GS/s 512-point FFT at 300 MHz, the measured power consumption is 507 mW. Compared with previous multimode FFT designs, our FFT chip is more area- and energy-efficient as it is able to provide relatively higher throughput per unit area or per unit power consumption. Also, the power scalability across FFT modes is relatively exhibited in the proposed FFT processor.},

year={2012},

pages={476-489}, 
abstract={Design and implementation of a hybrid energy scavenging integrated circuit (IC) is presented which includes an asynchronous self-powered analog sensor-data-logger (SDL) unit and a 13.56 MHz radio-frequency (RF) programming interface. The SDL unit operates on an event-based analog self-powering technique where the energy for sensing, computation and non-volatile storage is harvested directly from the signal being sensed. By exploiting operational primitives inherent in a controlled hot-electron injection mechanism, the SDL unit eliminates the need for voltage regulation, energy storage, ADCs, MCUs and RAMs which are commonly used in traditional energy scavenging sensors. Remote programming and data interrogation of the SDL unit are performed using an integrated 13.56 MHz RF back-telemetry interface. The interface consists of a 6-instruction set digital command and control unit based on a token-ring architecture; a high-voltage generator for programming floating-gate (FG) transistors; and an RF front-end unit for communicating with an external reader. We show that the self-powered design is suitable for integration with electro-capacitive transducers (e.g., piezoelectric transducers) that can generate open-load voltages greater than 5 V and drive currents less than 200 nA. Measured results from prototypes fabricated in a 0.5-μ m standard CMOS process demonstrate that the IC consumes less than 90 nA in the self-powering mode and less than 200 μW of power in the RF-powering mode with an interrogation distance up to 40 mm. By combining self-powering and RF-powering, we show that the sensor experiences minimum down-time and can continuously monitor and record level-crossing statistics of different attributes of sensor signals.},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={1}, 
pages={23-34}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a design approach targeting circuits operating at extremely low supply voltages, with the goal of reducing the voltage at which energy is minimized, thereby improving the achievable energy efficiency of the circuit. The proposed methods accomplish this by minimizing the circuit's ratio of leakage to active current. The first method, super pipelining, increases the number of pipeline stages compared to conventional ultra low voltage (ULV) pipelining strategies, reducing the leakage/dynamic energy ratio and simultaneously improving performance and energy efficiency. Measurements of super-pipelined multipliers demonstrate 30% energy savings and 1.6× performance improvement. Since super pipelining reduces the logic depth between registers, two-phase latch based design is employed to compensate for reduced averaging effects and provide better variation tolerance. The second technique introduces a parallel-pipelined architecture that suppresses leakage energy by ensuring full utilization of functional units and reduces memory size. We apply these techniques to a 16-b 1024-pt complex-valued Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) core along with low-power first-in first-out (FIFO) design and robust clock distribution network. The FFT core is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS and consumes 15.8 nJ/FFT with a clock frequency of 30 MHz and throughput of 240 Msamples/s at Vdd=270 mV, providing 2.4× better energy efficiency than current state-of-art and >; 10× higher throughput than typical ULV designs. Measurements of 60 dies show modest frequency (energy) σ/μ spreads of 7% (2%).},

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={4}, 
pages={797-809}, 
abstract={A 1920 × 1080 160° object viewpoint recognition system-on-chip (SoC) is presented in this paper. The SoC design is dedicated to wearable vision applications, and we address several crucial issues including the low recognition accuracy due to the use of low resolution images and dramatic changes in object viewpoints, and the high power consumption caused by the complex computations in existing computer vision object recognition systems. The human-centered design (HCD) mechanism is proposed in order to maintain a high recognition rate in difficult situations. To overcome the degradation of accuracy when dramatic changes to the object viewpoint occur, the object viewpoint prediction (OVP) engine in the HCD provides 160° object viewpoint in- variance by synthesizing various object poses from predicted object viewpoints. To achieve low power consumption, the visual vocabulary processor (VVP), which is based on bag-of-words (BoW) matching algorithm, is used to advance the matching stage from the feature-level to the object-level and results in a 97% reduction in the required memory bandwidth compared to previous recognition systems. Moreover, the matching efficiency of the VVP enables the system to support real-time full HD (1920 × 1080) processing, thereby improving the recognition rate for detecting a traffic light at a distance of 50 m to 95% compared to the 29% recognition rate for VGA (640 × 480) processing. The real-time 1920 × 1080 visual recognition chip is realized on a 6.38 mm2 die with 65 nm CMOS technology. It achieves an average recognition rate of 94%, a power efficiency of 1.18 TOPS/W, and an area efficiency of 25.9 GOPS/mm2 while only dissipating 52 mW at 1.0 V.},

pages={2385-2404}, 
abstract={A highly linear, efficient, two-stage power amplifier for high-data-rate wireless applications is presented. The linearity is greatly improved by adding an auxiliary amplifier to the main bipolar transistor amplifier in a feed-forward approach to cancel out the nonlinearity terms. The efficiency enhancement is achieved using a switchable biasing and a reconfigurable output-matching network based on the available input power which is monitored by an on-chip envelope detector. The PA is fabricated using 0.25- μm SiGe:C BiCMOS technology and works at 2 GHz with a supply voltage of 2.5 V. The experimental results show a gain of 13 dB and a maximum output power of 23 dBm with a PAE of 38%. The 1-dB output power compression point is 21 dBm with a 32% PAE. The 6-dB power back-off PAE is 23%. The IM3 and IM5 terms are 41 and 44 dB below the fundamental tone for the 21-dBm output power, respectively. The EVM has been measured to be -30.7 dB at 15-dBm average output power using IEEE 802.16e standard WiMAX 64QAM modulated signal. By employing the linearization technique, EVM and ACLR are improved by 4.5 and 5 dB, respectively, for a WiMAX 64QAM 10-MHz signal bandwidth at 14-dBm average output power.},

abstract={This paper presents the single channel galvanically isolated gate driver optimized for driving a normally-on silicon carbide junction field effect transistor (SiC JFET) also presented at ISSCC 2012 [1]. The idea of the chosen direct drive JFET concept is to switch power with a normally-on SiC JFET, using the high voltage breakdown capability of the SiC JFET and ensuring a safe normally-off behavior using a normally-off low voltage MOSFET in series. By controlling the transistor gates individually the JFET can be driven with minimum switching losses and good control. The driver makes the operation and handling of normally-on SiC JFETs as safe as normally-off switches, thereby simplifying the integration of normally-on SiC JFETs into systems like switch mode power supplies. To transfer the signal from the controller to the driver over a needed galvanic isolation of 1700 V a two chip solution with a coreless transformer arranged in one package was chosen, using a 0.6 μm BiCMOS and a 0.8 μm BCD technology. Powering of the gate driver through bootstrapping has been made possible, due to the direct drive JFET concept and the further integration of supervision and control circuitry and a negative voltage regulator that regulates the entire p-substrate of the driver chip. Tested together with the JFET in a buck converter efficiencies over 99% have been measured.},

abstract={This paper proposes schemes for the direct measurement of bit-line (BL) voltage swing, sense amplifier (SA) offset voltage, and word-line (WL) pulse width, demonstrated in a 40 nm CMOS 32 kb fully functional SRAM macro with <;2% area penalty. This is the first such scheme to enable the optimal tuning of WL-pulse (WLP) width according to on-site measurement results for BL voltage swing, dynamic read stability, and write margin, all of which depend on WLP width. It also eliminates the need for additional margins related to BL voltage swing, which has conventionally been required to ensure adequate tolerances against simulation errors and inaccurate estimation of SA offset voltage. This opens up possibilities for a more aggressive approach to deal with WLP width instead of only ensuring the target BL voltage swing.},

abstract={This paper presents a 10-bit 80-MS/s successive approximation time-to-digital converter (TDC) with a decision-select structure for on-chip timing measurement applications. Time-domain successive approximation is realized utilizing a relative timing difference between input and reference timings. While the successive approximation scheme allows high bit resolutions and low power consumptions, the decision-select structure enables fast bit conversions that lead to high sampling rates. The decision-select structure unrolls the successive approximation iteration loop and removes time-consuming timing estimation and adjustment procedures to minimize bit conversion times. As the successive approximation scheme relies on a binary search, exponential delay lines are adopted to achieve good power and noise performances by reducing the total number of delay stages. The proposed TDC uses only 0.048 delay stages per bit conversion. A test-chip prototype fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology consumes 9.6 mW at 80-MS/s and demonstrates 0.23-pJ/conversion-step figure-of merit (FOM) and 0.5-LSB single-shot precision.},

abstract={A 0.5-V fully integrated R-MOSFET-C filter with low power, good linearity, and wide frequency tunability is demonstrated. It relies upon the operational transconductance amplifier using the cross-forward common-mode cancellation and the linear sub-threshold R-MOSFET resistor-both employ subthreshold operation of the transistors. A fifth-order Chebyshev low-pass filter using regular transistors with a 0.5-V threshold voltage in a 0.18-μm triple-well CMOS process is implemented for a 0.5-V supply. The filter's bandwidth can be tuned from 91 to 268 kHz, which is almost a 3-to-1 tuning ratio. At a nominal bandwidth of 135 kHz automatically set by the on-chip PLL circuit, the dynamic range is at 61.0 dB for 1% total harmonic distortion, while the spurious-free dynamic range under two-tone signals is at 53.7 dB. The total current and power consumptions including bias circuits are 1.2 mA and 0.6 mW, respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce a merged two-stage dc-dc power converter for low-voltage power delivery. By separating the transformation and regulation function of a dc-dc power converter into two stages, both large voltage transformation and high switching frequency can be achieved. We show how the switched-capacitor stage can operate under soft charging conditions by suitable control and integration (merging) of the two stages. This mode of operation enables improved efficiency and/or power density in the switched-capacitor stage. A 5-to-1 V, 0.8 W integrated dc-dc converter has been developed in 180 nm CMOS.

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={3}, 
pages={686-698}, 
abstract={This paper presents the design and implementation of a high-performance fully-digital PWM DAC and switching output stage which can drive a speaker in portable devices, including cellular phones. Thanks to the quaternary pulse-width modulation scheme, filter-less implementation are possible. A pre-modulation DSP algorithm eliminates the harmonic distortion inherent to the employed modulation process, and an oversampling noise shaper reduces the modulator clock speed to facilitate the hardware implementation while keeping high-fidelity quality. Radiated electromagnetic field emission of the class D amplifier is reduced thanks to a clock spreading technique with only a minor impact on audio performance characteristics. Clock jitter effects on the audio amplifier performance are presented, showing very low degradation for jitter value up to a few nanoseconds. The digital section works with a 1.2 V power supply voltage, while the output switching stage and its driver are supplied from a high-efficiency DC-DC converter either at 3.6 V or 5 V. An output power of 0.5 W at 3.6 V and 1 W at 5 V over an 8 Ω load with efficiency (digital section included) of about 79% and 81%, respectively, has been achieved. The total harmonic distortion (THD) at maximum output level is about 0.2%, while the dynamic range is 104 dB A-weighted. The active area is about 0.94 mm2 in a 0.13 μm single-poly, five-metal, N-well digital CMOS technology with double-oxide option (0.5 μm minimum length).},

abstract={This paper presents a level shifter circuit capable of handling extremely low-voltage inputs. The circuit has a distinctive current generation scheme using a logic error correction circuit that works by detecting the input and output logic levels. The proposed level shifter circuit can convert low-voltage digital input signals into high-voltage digital output signals. The circuit achieves low-power operation because it dissipates operating current only when the input signal changes. Measurement results demonstrated that the circuit can convert a 0.23-V input signal into a 3-V output signal. The power dissipation was 58 nW for a 0.4-V 10-kHz input pulse.},

A set of various circuit primitives, such as one- and four-quadrant multipliers, an Euclidean distance operator and a fourth-order log-domain filter, were mapped on the chip in order to demonstrate the versatility of the approach.

abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated CMOS 60-GHz transceiver chipset for short-range and high-speed wireless communication. The target application of the short-range communication is less than 5-cm communication distance and more than 2-Gb/s throughput for file transfer. In order to achieve file transfer, physical (PHY) layers with error packet correction and media access control (MAC) layer with frame-exchanging function are implemented. The MAC is designed to have a high-efficiency feature due to short interval DATA/Acknowledgement (ACK) frame exchange. It is realized by fast transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) switching. A bonding wire-based in-package antenna is adopted using a standard BGA package without any off-chip 60-GHz components. The proposed chipset is composed of two chips, an RF chip with in-package antenna, and a baseband chip including PHY and MAC layer.

abstract={This paper presents a 28-Gb/s transceiver in 32-nm SOI CMOS technology for chip-to-chip communications over high-loss electrical channels such as backplanes. The equalization needed for such applications is provided by a 4-tap baud-spaced feed-forward equalizer (FFE) in the transmitter and a two-stage peaking amplifier and 15-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) in the receiver. The transmitter employs a source-series terminated (SST) driver topology which doubles the speed of existing half-rate designs. The high-frequency boost provided by the peaking amplifier is enhanced by adopting a structure with capacitively coupled parallel input stages and active feedback. A capacitive level-shifting technique is introduced in the half-rate DFE which allows a single current-integrating summer to drive the four parallel paths used for speculating the first two DFE taps. Error-free signaling at 28 Gb/s is demonstrated with the transceiver over a channel with 35 dB loss at half-baud frequency. In a four-port core configuration, the power consumption at 28 Gb/s is 693 mW/lane.},

abstract={This paper presents a 40-130 fJ/bit/ch on-chip data link design under a 0.1-0.3 V power supply. A bootstrapped CMOS repeater is proposed to drive a 10 mm on-chip bus. It features a -VDD to 2VDD swing to enhance the driving capability and reduces the sub-threshold leakage current. Additionally, a precharge enhancement scheme increases the speed of the data transmission, and a leakage current reduction technique suppresses ISI jitter. A test chip is fabricated in a 55 nm SPRVT Low-K CMOS process.

abstract={The viability of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy has improved dramatically in recent years: large increases in manufacturing capacity have driven reductions in cost and higher efficiencies, improving lifetime cost of energy (LCOE). Mismatch loss remains an important consideration in PV systems and a range of power electronic solutions have been proposed to recover losses due to shading, dust/debris, factory mismatch and aging. This paper presents a high-voltage CMOS IC and embedded system based on a resonant switched-capacitor converter. The solution is integrated into the junction box to balance power flow in parallel with sub-module strings of PV cells. A custom dual-core cable and connector extend the balancing function to multiple PV modules connected in series, improving energy production of large-scale PV arrays in the case of shading or mismatch. The converter is based on a resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) topology that achieves effective conversion efficiency over 99% for a wide range of mismatch, insertion loss below 0.1%, a vertical footprint less than 6 mm, and weight less than 1 Oz.},

abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time (CT) ΔΣ modulator using a VCO-based internal quantizer. It incorporates a nonlinear VCO as the second stage in a two-stage residue canceling quantizer (RCQ) and mitigates the impact of its nonlinearity by spanning only a small region of the VCO's V-to-F nonlinear tuning curve. The order of noise shaping is increased by placing the RCQ in a continuous-time ΔΣ loop. Using only a first order loop filter, the proposed ΔΣ modulator achieves second order noise shaping. Fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS process, the prototype modulator occupies an active area of 0.36 mm2 and consumes 16 mW power. It achieves a peak SNDR of 78.3 dB in 10-MHz bandwidth and an SFDR of better than 85 dB when clocked at 600 MHz. The figure of merit of the modulator is 120 fJ/conv-step.},

abstract={A wideband CMOS highly linear and low noise RF front-end including inductor-less wideband LNA, integrated passive tunable filter, harmonic rejection mixer (HRM), and loop-through amplifier (LTA) is proposed for universal tuners. The proposed inductor-less wideband LNA shows a gain range greater than 55 dB with fine gain step less than 0.5 dB while achieving higher linearity and lower noise figure (NF), as compared with the traditional resistive/active feedback LNA through a source follower (SF). The integrated tunable filter covers the entire VHF bands without dividing the frequency range by multiple filters. By adopting tunable filter and HRM simultaneously, the overall harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) of over 65 dBc is obtained. The active feedback LTA utilizing a complementary characteristic of NMOS and PMOS is proposed for supporting multiple tuner applications. The proposed RF front-end achieves a maximum voltage gain of 42 dB, a minimum NF of 4.7 dB, and CTB and CSO of under -60 dBc.

year={2012}, 
volume={47}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2007-2018}, 
abstract={This paper presents the design insights for the implementation of a fully monolithic radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) using both envelope-tracking (ET) and transistor resizing techniques for long-term evolution (LTE) applications. At the low output power region, some of the power cells in the PA can be disabled to further save power consumption, thus enhancing the efficiency from a traditional ET-PA. Our ET-PA system is first realized with a two-chip solution, consisting of a high voltage envelope modulator fabricated in a 0.35 μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology, and a differential cascode PA in a 0.35 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. This two-chip solution of the ET-PA is to showcase the effective efficiency enhancement of using the transistor resizing method. In the second design, a CMOS envelope modulator is integrated with the cascode PA on the same die in the 0.35 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Some insights are demonstrated regarding the optimization of the envelope modulator specific to our cascode PA for LTE broadband signals, where the finite bandwidth and the switching frequency of the envelope modulator are considered for achieving the minimal error-vector magnitude (EVM) and spurious noise. The fully monolithic BiCMOS ET-PA reaches the maximum linear output power (Pout) of 24 dBm and 23.4 dBm with overall power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 41% and 38% for the LTE 16QAM 5 MHz and 10 MHz signals at 1.9 GHz, respectively, without needing predistortion. At the low power mode of our ET-PA, an additional PAE enhancement of 4% is obtained at Pout of 16-20 dBm by disabling some of the PA power cells. Our fully monolithic ET-PA satisfies the LTE 16QAM linearity specs with high efficiency.},

abstract={Integrators are key building blocks in many analog signal processing circuits and systems. The DC gain of conventional opamp-RC or Gm- C integrators is severely limited by the gain of operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) used to implement them. Process scaling reduces transistor output resistance, which further exacerbates this issue. We propose applying ring oscillator integrators (ROIs) in the design of high order analog filters. ROIs implemented with simple CMOS inverters achieve infinite DC gain at low supply voltages independent of transistor non-idealities and imperfections such as finite output impedance. Consequently, ROIs scale more effectively into newer processes. A prototype fourth order filter designed using the ROIs was fabricated in 90 nm CMOS and occupies an area of 0.29 mm2. Operating with a 0.55 V supply, the filter consumes 2.9 mW power and achieves bandwidth of 7 MHz, SNR of 61.4 dB, SFDR of 67.6 dB and THD of 60.1 dB. The measured IM3 obtained by feeding two tones at 1 MHz and 2 MHz is 63.4 dB.},

abstract={AVS technique for extremely scaled SoCs has been developed. To reduce design cost, we have developed a supply voltage control scheme employing universal delay line (UDL), rather than a replica delay line, for monitoring the critical path delay (TCRIT). The UDL can be used in any product without any need for customizing. In addition, averaging the results of distributed 4 monitors with a pitch of 3 mm in a chip can reduce errors due to within-die variation by half. With these techniques, proposed scheme produces equivalent or less error to TCRIT than does a conventional scheme that uses a single critical path replica as a delay monitor, even with simple monitor design. We have shown that 40-nm CMOS SoCs using our AVS can reduce active power by 27%.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a high-speed ultra low power SRAM memory. Divided bit lines improve dynamic cell stability while at the same time decreasing active energy consumption. To limit unnecessary activity, word lines are divided on a word-by-word basis. Local write sense amplifiers make it possible to use low swing signaling on the global bit lines. To control this architecture, a distributed decoder is used. The use of dual swing data links on the global bit lines limits the impact of local write sense amplifier offset on the overall energy consumption. Using high threshold transistors in the memory cells reduces static power consumption and improves the cell's read stability. A partly dynamic decoder structure increases memory speed at a very low energy cost. The timing of this memory is made configurable to be able to cope with PVT variations without increasing design margins. The designed 256 kbit memory was fabricated in a 65 nm triple-VT process. It operates up to a speed of 850 MHz while only consuming 4.3 pJ/access for a word length of 32 bit. Standby leakage power is 25.2 W. This memory clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art designs when targeting high-speed, low-leakage and low active energy applications.},

pages={1866-1883}, 
abstract={A dynamic comparator-based OTA is introduced as a replacement for a conventional OTA. It performs charge transfer in a switched-capacitor circuit by repeatedly evaluating the polarity of the differential input using a dynamic clocked comparator and injecting current pulses at the output to move the input voltage toward zero. The amplitude of the current pulse is reduced each time the input voltage crosses zero to provide fast but accurate settling of the output voltage. Dynamic comparator-based OTAs are applied to the design of a 1-1-1-1 MASH delta-sigma modulator. The 65-nm CMOS prototype achieves a 70.4 dB peak SNDR over a 2.5-MHz bandwidth while consuming 3.73 mW from a 1.2-V supply. The 276-fJ/conv-step FoM represents a four times improvement over previously-reported delta-sigma modulators using zero-crossing-based circuits or comparator-based switched capacitors. Because of the dynamic operation of the OTAs and discrete-time delta-sigma modulator architecture, both bandwidth and power consumption linearly scale with the sampling frequency without any reconfiguration of the modulator.},

abstract={Recently, a growing interest has arisen about the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique, that allows the analysis of fast and weak light waveforms with a time resolution in the picosecond order. Since TCSPC basically consists of the measurement of the arrival time of a photon, a high resolution and high linearity time measurement block is of the utmost importance; moreover, the use of multianode Photo Multiplier Tube and of single photon avalanche diode arrays led to the development of multichannel acquisition systems, where the time measurement block has to be integrated to reduce both cost and area. We have designed and fabricated a four channel fully integrated time-to-amplitude converter (TAC), built in 0.35 μm Si-Ge technology, characterized by an excellent time resolution (less than 50 ps full width half maximum), low differential nonlinearity (better than 0.02 LSB peak-peak and 0.0003 LSB rms), high counting rate (16 MHz), low and constant power dissipation (50 mW) and low area occupation (2.58 × 1.28 mm2 ). Moreover, the very low crosstalk ( -115 dB) between channels, together with low power and low area makes the converter suitable for large scale multi-channel acquisition chains.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS image sensor with direct digital phase output for time-resolved fluorescence imaging applications. A row-level zero-crossing detection is implemented to extract the phase-shift between the intensity modulated excitation signal and the emitted fluorescence, generating a time delay signal proportional to the fluorescence lifetime of the target analyte. A time-interpolated Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is subsequently used to quantize the time delay into a digital representation of the phase-shift for post-signal processing and image reconstruction. For proof-of-concept, a prototype chip consisting of a 32×32 P+/N-Well/P-Substrate photodiode array, row-level phase readout circuits, and a global TDC is implemented in a low-power 65 nm CMOS technology. The TDC features a temporal resolution of 110 ps over a 414 μs range, which corresponds to a dynamic range of 132 dB. Extensive characterization results demonstrate a phase readout sensitivity of better than 0.01 degrees at a 1.2 kHz modulation frequency and 0.1 degrees at up to 1 MHz. The complete imager chip is evaluated through a sequence of phase image reconstruction experiments, and the results are presented.},

abstract={Among all the emerging memories, Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) has demonstrated many promising features such as fast access speed, nonvolatility, excellent scalability, and compatibility to CMOS process. However, the large process variations of both magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and MOS transistors in the scaled technologies severely limit the yield of STT-RAM chips. In this work, we proposed a new sensing scheme, named as nondestructive self-reference sensing, or NSRS, for STT-RAM. By leveraging the different dependencies of the high and low resistance states of MTJs on the cell current amplitude, the proposed NSRS technique can work well at the scenario when bit-to-bit variation of MTJ resistances is large. Furthermore, we proposed three combined magnetic- and circuit-level techniques, including R-I curve skewing, yield-driven cell current selection, and ratio matching, to further improve the sense margin and robustness of NSRS sensing scheme. The measurement results of a 16 Kb STT-RAM test chip show that our proposed nondestructive self-reference sensing technique can reliably readout all the measured memory bits, of which 10% read failure rate was observed by using the conventional sensing technique. The three enhancement technologies ensure a 20 mV minimum sense margin and the whole sensing process can complete within 15 ns.},

abstract={Cyclic-coupled ring oscillators (CCRO) provide several unique features over regular ring oscillators such as availability of multiple sets of phase-shifted outputs and reduced phase noise. Furthermore, when combined with N-push frequency multiplication low phase noise, wide tuning ranges and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies can be realized. In this work, we propose two N-push CCROs fabricated in a 90 nm digital CMOS process. First, a wideband N-Push/M-Push CCRO is presented which achieves an output frequency range of 3.16-12.8 GHz using a unit cell ring oscillator operating at 1-2.56 GHz. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -103.4 dBc/Hz and -101.6 dBc/Hz at 3.16 GHz and 12.8 GHz, respectively. Second, an mm-wave N-Push CCRO is presented. It generates an output frequency of 13-25 GHz with a low phase noise performance of -95 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset over the output frequency range. The proposed oscillators achieve superior phase noise performance as well as competitive figure-of-merit compared with the state-of-the-art ring oscillators. In addition, the operation of the CCRO and its phase noise is analyzed. We confirm, analytically and experimentally, that the phase noise of an M-stage CCRO improves by 10 M over that of a single ring oscillator. We also show that the phase noise improvement bandwidth is a function of the coupling strength.},

abstract={We describe transmitter and receiver circuits for a 10-Gbps single-ended optical link in a 40-nm CMOS technology. The circuits are bonded using low-parasitic micro-solder bumps to silicon photonic devices on a 130-nm SOI platform. The transmitter drives oval resonant ring modulators with a 2-V swing and employs static thermal tuners to compensate for optical device process variations. The receiver is based on a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with 4-kΩ gain and designed for an input power of - 15 dBm, a photodiode responsivity of 0.7 A/W, and an input extinction ratio of 6 dB. It employs a pair of interleaved clocked sense-amplifiers for voltage slicing and uses a DLL with phase adjustment for centering the clock in the data eye. Periodic calibration allows for adjustment of both voltage and timing margins. At 10 Gbps, the transmitter extinction ratio exceeds 7 dB and, excluding thermal tuning and laser power, it consumes 1.35 mW. At the same datarate, the receiver consumes 3.95 mW.

abstract={We propose a CMOS image sensor with time-division multiplexing pixel architecture using standard pinned-photodiode for capturing 2-D color image as well as extracting 3-D depth information of a target object. The proposed pixel can alternately provide both color and depth images in each frame. Two split photodiode and four transfer gates in each pixel improve the transfer speed of generated electrons to be capable of demodulating a high-frequency time-of-flight signal. In addition, four-shared pixel architecture acquires a color image with high spatial resolution and generates a reliable depth map by inherent binning operation in charge domain. A 712 496 pixel array has been fabricated using a 0.11μm standard CMOS imaging process and fully characterized. A 6m pixel with 34.5% aperture ratio can be operated at 10-MHz modulation frequency with 70% demodulation contrast. We have successfully captured both images of exactly same scene from the fabricated test chip. It shows a depth uncertainty of less than 60 mm and a linearity error of about 2% between 1 and 3 m distance with 50-ms integration time. Moreover, high-gain readout operation enables to improve the performance, achieving about 43-mm depth uncertainty at 3 m.},

abstract={This work introduces the use of compressed sensing (CS) algorithms for data compression in wireless sensors to address the energy and telemetry bandwidth constraints common to wireless sensor nodes. Circuit models of both analog and digital implementations of the CS system are presented that enable analysis of the power/performance costs associated with the design space for any potential CS application, including analog-to-information converters (AIC). Results of the analysis show that a digital implementation is significantly more energy-efficient for the wireless sensor space where signals require high gain and medium to high resolutions. The resulting circuit architecture is implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process. Measured power results correlate well with the circuit models, and the test system demonstrates continuous, on-the-fly data processing, resulting in more than an order of magnitude compression for electroencephalography (EEG) signals while consuming only 1.9 μW at 0.6 V for sub-20 kS/s sampling rates.

abstract={This paper presents an energy-efficient capacitive-sensor interface with a period-modulated output signal. This interface converts the sensor capacitance to a time interval, which can be easily digitized by a simple digital counter. It is based on a relaxation oscillator consisting of an integrator and a comparator. To enable the use of a current-efficient telescopic OTA in the integrator, negative feedback loops are applied to limit the integrator's output swing. To obtain an accurate ratiometric output signal, auto-calibration is applied. This eliminates errors due to comparator delay, thus enabling the use of a low-power comparator. Based on an analysis of the stability of the negative feedback loops, it is shown how the current consumption of the interface can be traded for its ability to handle parasitic capacitors. A prototype fabricated in 0.35 μm standard CMOS technology can handle parasitic capacitors up to five times larger than the sensor capacitance. Experimental results show that it achieves 15-bit resolution and 12-bit linearity within a measurement time of 7.6 ms for sensor capacitances up to 6.8 pF, while consuming only 64 μA from a 3.3 V power supply. Compared to prior work with similar performance, this represents a significant improvement in energy efficiency.},

abstract={This paper proposes a NAND controller system with a NAND channel number detector for 3D-integrated SSD. The control techniques of a program-voltage generator and an I/O frequency are proposed to enhance the SSD performance. This paper presents the solutions for the problems such as the rising time degradation and the increased power consumption caused by multi-channel parallel operation. The proposed NAND channel number detector automatically detects the number of accessed channels, that is, the number of NAND chips written at the same time. Based on the number of accessed channels, the intelligent program-voltage booster adaptively optimizes the switching clock. As a result, the proposed 3D-SSD realizes both the fastest write and the lowest energy consumption. The proposed 3D-SSD increases the write speed by 60% and decreases the energy consumption of the booster by 32%. Moreover, a dynamic I/O frequency control scheme is proposed for the future high speed I/O 3D-SSD. By selecting the adequate I/O frequencies based on the accessed number of channels, the summation of the SSD and the I/O power consumption is kept below 3.5 W even if 24 channels are operated in parallel.},

pages={1448-1459}, 
abstract={The developed associative-memory architecture utilizes a mapping operation of the Hamming distances into frequency space with ring oscillators programmable in discrete frequency steps. As a result fast word-parallel search of the nearest Hamming distance with low power consumption is obtained. Additionally, high robustness against fabrication-related variations of the MOSFET characteristics is achievable by design because the size of the frequency steps is a freely selectable design parameter which can be adjusted to compensate the variation magnitude. A quantitative analysis of within-die variation effects on the reliability of the associative-memory architecture is presented and guidelines for the choice of the design parameters at a given magnitude of the variation effects are derived. Feasibility and performance of this associative-memory architecture are experimentally evaluated with a VLSI design in 180 nm CMOS technology containing 64 reference patterns each consisting of 256 bits. The fabricated chip is correctly operating down to low supply voltages (Vdd) of 0.7 V. The power dissipation is less than 36.5 mW and 307 μW at supply voltages of 1.8 V (nominal supply) and 0.7 V, respectively. Measured search reliability is found to be in agreement with measured variations of the important design parameters and expectations from the variation analysis. In comparison to previously reported digital associative-memory designs, the achieved power dissipation is more than 5 times smaller, while the average search speed is only slightly improved. For Vdd = 1.8 V the search time ranges from a minimum of 50 ns at Hamming distance 0 to a maximum of 245 ns for the largest Hamming distance 255.},

The CMOS imager consists of a 64 × 128-pixel array interdigitated with a 32 × 64 electrolessly plated nickel-gold microelectrode array. A two-transistor reset path technique attenuates the subthreshold leakage current of the reset transistor which constitutes a significant portion of the dark current. An active reset technique, in-pixel flicker noise cancellation, and pixel binning contribute to noise reduction. The imager achieves a low dark current of 3.6 nA/cm2 for photodiode reset voltages as high as 2.3 V, noise of 110 μVrms with maximum time of photon integration of 90 s, and a dynamic range of 67.8 dB. The CMOS-microfluidic microsystem is validated in on-chip chemiluminescence and electrochemiluminescence detection of luminol.},

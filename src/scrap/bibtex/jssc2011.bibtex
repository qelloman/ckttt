abstract={A fully integrated front-end IC is demonstrated for 802.11b/g transceivers with integrated power amplifiers. The SP3T-LNA architecture integrates Bluetooth® functionality with transmit and receive for wireless LAN. The transmit switch achieves a P1dB greater than 33.0 dBm at 2.5 GHz by employing a cross-biasing approach, transistor stacking and deep n-well process. Power handling techniques used for the switches and the associated performance tradeoffs are discussed. The measured noise figure of the LNA and the receive chain comprising both an LNA and a switch is 1.5 dB and 3.0 dB, respectively. The LNA achieves an IIP3 of 7.0 dBm while consuming 7.0 mA of current. The measured switching times are less than 350 ns.

abstract={An 8-channel 6-bit 16-GS/s time-interleaved analog- to-digital converter (TI ADC) was fabricated using a 65 nm CMOS technology. Each analog-to-digital channel is a 6-bit flash ADC.

The TI ADC includes a multi-phase clock generator that uses a delay-locked loop to generate 8 sampling clocks from a reference clock of the same frequency. The uniformity of the sampling intervals is ensured by digital timing-skew calibration. Both the offset calibration and the timing-skew calibration run continuously in the background. At 16 GS/s sampling rate, this ADC chip achieves a signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SNDR) of 30.8 dB. The chip consumes 435 mW from a 1.5 V supply. The ADC active area is 0.93 × 1.58 mm2.},

abstract={Dual-gate organic transistor technology is used to increase the robustness of digital circuits as illustrated by higher inverter gains and noise margins. The additional gate in the technology functions as a VT-control gate. Both zero-VGS-load and diode-load logic are investigated. The noise margin of zero- VGS-load inverter increases from 1.15 V (single gate) to 2.8 V (dual gate) at 20 V supply voltage. Diode-load logic inverters show an improvement in noise margin from ~0 V to 0.7 V for single gate and dual gate inverters, respectively. These values can be increased significantly by optimizing the inverter topologies. As a result of this optimization, noise margins larger than 6 V for zero- VGS-load logic and 1.4 V for diode-load logic are obtained. Functional 99-stage ring oscillators with 2.27 μs stage delays and 64 bit organic RFID transponder chips, operating at a data rate of 4.3 kb/s, have been manufactured.},

pages={1928-1939}, 
abstract={This paper presents a multi-MHz buck regulator for portable applications using an auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control (ASPVCC) scheme. The proposed ASPVCC scheme can enable the current-mode buck regulator to reduce the settling-time requirement of the current sensing by two times. In addition, the dynamically biased shunt feedback technique is employed to improve the sensing speed and the sensing accuracy of both the peak and valley current sensors. With both ASPVCC scheme and advanced current sensors, the buck regulator can thus operate at high switching frequencies with a wide range of duty ratios for reducing the required off-chip inductance. The proposed current-mode buck regulator was fabricated in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS process and occupies a small chip area of 0.54 mm2. Measurement results show that the buck regulator can deliver a maximum output current of 500 mA, operate at 5 MHz with a wide duty-ratio range of about 0.6, use a small-value off-chip inductor of 1 μH, and achieve the peak power efficiency of 91%.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1701-1714}, 
abstract={This paper presents the design of an integrated nerve stimulator for use with tripole electrodes. The main features of the design are: it is a constant current stimulator with passive electrode discharge; it is fail-safe without requiring discrete capacitors in series with the electrodes; and the anode current ratio can be adjusted to minimize the electric field outside the electrode mount (cuff, book, etc) so as to prevent crosstalk to adjacent nerves. The safety feature uses high-frequency current switching (HFCS) employing small on-chip blocking capacitors. The charge loss due to the parasitic capacitances in the HFCS output stage is reduced by bootstrapping. In addition, a method is described to implement the current generator featuring small silicon area and good linearity. A two-channel stimulator was implemented in a 0.6-μm silicon-on-insulator CMOS process. The current generator occupies a silicon area of 0.3 mm2. It consists of a 4-bit coarse amplitude section with 100 μA steps and a 4-bit differential adjustment section with 6.25 μA steps. The output stage achieves a charge efficiency of about 90% for a 1 kΩ load and occupies a silicon area of 0.5 mm2. The performance of the stimulator, including crosstalk nulling measurements, was verified using tripoles in saline. The HFCS method should be considered for stimulators which must be small and sited close to the target nervous tissue.},

Primarily due to the need for high-efficiency converters and appropriate techniques to control high-frequency capacitive DC-DC converters. This paper presents a fully integrated capacitive step-down DC-DC converter in 90 nm CMOS with an output power capability of 150 mW, a peak efficiency of 77% and a full load efficiency of 74%.

year={2011},

number={1}, 
pages={194-208}, 
abstract={A 45 nm microprocessor core integrates resilient error-detection and recovery circuits to mitigate the clock frequency (FCLK) guardbands for dynamic parameter variations to improve throughput and energy efficiency. The core supports two distinct error-detection designs, allowing a direct comparison of the relative trade-offs. The first design embeds error-detection sequential (EDS) circuits in critical paths to detect late timing transitions. In addition to reducing the Fclk guardbands for dynamic variations, the embedded EDS design can exploit path-activation rates to operate the microprocessor faster than infrequently-activated critical paths. The second error-detection design offers a less-intrusive approach for dynamic timing-error detection by placing a tunable replica circuit (TRC) per pipeline stage to monitor worst-case delays. Although the TRCs require a delay guardband to ensure the TRC delay is always slower than critical-path delays, the TRC design captures most of the benefits from the embedded EDS design with less implementation overhead. Furthermore, while core min-delay constraints limit the potential benefits of the embedded EDS design, a salient advantage of the TRC design is the ability to detect a wider range of dynamic delay variation, as demonstrated through low supply voltage (VCC) measurements. Both error-detection designs interface with error-recovery techniques, enabling the detection and correction of timing errors from fast-changing variations such as high-frequency VCC droops. The microprocessor core also supports two separate error-recovery techniques to guarantee correct execution even if dynamic variations persist. The first technique requires clock control to replay errant instructions at 1/2FCLK. In comparison, the second technique is a new multiple-issue instruction replay design that corrects errant instructions with a lower performance penalty and without requiring clock control. Silic- n measurements demonstrate that resilient circuits enable a 41% throughput gain at equal energy or a 22% energy reduction at equal throughput, as compared to a conventional design when executing a benchmark program with a 10% VCC droop. In addition, the microprocessor includes a new adaptive clock control circuit that interfaces with the resilient circuits and a phase-locked loop (PLL) to track recovery cycles and adapt to persistent errors by dynamically changing Fclk f°Γ maximum efficiency.},

abstract={A 3.8 Gb/s multi-drop single-ended integrating DFE (IDFE) receiver is implemented in a 0.18 um CMOS by using a single-loop LMS-algorithm to find the DFE coefficients automatically. Initially, a preamble input data pattern ('1101') is applied to the main IDFE circuit to determine the DFE coefficients, while a fixed input data pattern ('1111') is applied to the replica IDFE circuit. The difference between the outputs of the two IDFE circuits is used in the feedback loop to determine the DFE coefficients. The reference voltage (Vref) of preamplifier is generated inside chip by a Vref loop to reduce the effect of the external noise and the input offset voltage of preamplifier and IDFE circuits and also to track the mid-level of the input data swing in spite of process variations of TX chips. An integrating deskew scheme with a minimum overhead is introduced. 2-drop and 4-drop DRAM channels are tested. The maximum data rate was increased from 1.0 Gb/s to 2.6 Gb/s by DFE in the heavily loaded 4-drop interface, from 3.5 Gb/s to 3.8 Gb/s by DFE in the 2-drop interface.},

abstract={This paper describes the design of a 10-Gb/s fully integrated CMOS optical receiver, which consists of a novel spatially-modulated photo detector (SMPD), a low-noise trans-impedance amplifier (TIA), and a post-limiting amplifier on a single chip. The bandwidth of proposed meshed SMPD can be boosted up to 6.9 GHz under a reverse-biased voltage of 14.2 V. The measured responsivity of the meshed SMPD is 29 mA/W as illuminated by 850-nm light source. To compensate the relatively low responsivity of on-chip CMOS photo detector (PD), a high-gain TIA with nested feedback and shunt peaking is proposed to achieve low-noise operation. The optical receiver is capable of delivering 25-kΩ conversion gain when driving 50-Ω output loads. For a PRBS test pattern of 27- 1, the 10-Gb/s optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC) has optical sensitivity of - 6 dBm at a bit-error rate (BER) of 10 -11. Implemented in a generic 0.18-μm CMOS technology, the chip area is 0.95 mm by 0.8 mm.

The DAC with the double-sampling technique achieves an excellent sampling speed of up to 32 GS/s with low power consumption of 1.4 W. The second design is based on a new timing alignment technique. The DAC with the timing alignment technique operates at a sampling rate of 28 GS/s with very low power consumption of 0.95 W and achieves an excellent figure of merit (0.53 pJ per conversion step).

volume={46},

abstract={Hot-electron injection is widely used for accurate programming of on-chip floating-gate voltage and current references. The conventional programming approach involves adapting the duration and magnitude of the injection pulses based on a predictive model which is estimated by using measured data. However, varying the pulse-widths or amplitudes introduces nonlinearity in the injection process which complicates the modeling, calibration and programming procedure. In this paper, we propose a linear hot-electron injection technique which significantly simplifies the programming procedure, and can achieve programming accuracy greater than 13-b which is limited by the thermal noise from the injection process. The procedure employs an active feedback circuit which ensures that all the nonlinear factors affecting the hot-electron injection process are held constant, thus achieving a stable and controllable injection rate. Measured results using an array of floating-gate voltage reference prototyped in a 0.5-μm standard CMOS process demonstrate that the injection rates can be controlled from 0.1 to 4.1 V for the programmable voltage range. Using 50-ms injection pulses, we show that the average injection rate can be adapted from 6.9 to 250 μV/cycle.},

pages={1307-1320}, 
abstract={This paper presents a wide-band fractional-N frequency synthesizer for multi-standard cellular and short-range wireless communication receivers. The synthesizer covers the frequency band from 1.8 to 6 GHz and supports the standards of DCS1800, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, WLAN802.11 a/b/g and Bluetooth. Architecture design and frequency planning are carefully performed to tradeoff wide frequency range and power efficiency. A quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) with a new phase shifter scheme is developed which shows better phase noise performance and more stable oscillation. Combining harmonic rejection and single sideband mixing, a harmonic-rejection SSBmixer (HR-SSBmixer) is developed to suppress unwanted sidebands and spurious signals. It serves as a power-saving solution to generate the LO signal for the 802.11a mode by avoiding power-hungry poly-phase filters or high-frequency LO buffers and dividers. The synthesizer is designed in a 0.13-μm CMOS technology. It occupies an active area of 1.86 mm2 and consumes 35.6 to 52.62 mW of power. Measurement results show that the synthesizer is able to provide in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) signals supporting the standards mentioned above.},

abstract={This work addresses the device modeling challenges of production-quality, state-of-the-art, silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) processes. Differences between SOS, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), and bulk CMOS are highlighted, with emphasis on the key differences in the modeling methodology. For RF and low-power applications, SOS has distinct advantages over SOI, such as reduced parasitics, better linearity, and enhanced electrical isolation. Yet little is reported in the literature about modeling of a commercially viable SOS process. Though originally developed for SOI, it is demonstrated that the BSIMSOI model can adequately represent SOS MOSFETs, including fully and partially depleted devices. For RF switch applications, RON and COFF are captured with reasonable accuracy. An additional RF figure of merit, fT, is also reasonably well modeled, yielding peak values in the 40-50 GHz range.},

pages={660-668}, 
abstract={A pseudo-cascode compensation technique is proposed to enable a process-insensitive and current-scalable design of the classical two-stage opamp at low supply voltages, without requiring any additional power dissipation. Furthermore, a bulk-biasing technique is proposed to enhance the dc gain of the two-stage opamp, without affecting its output-voltage swing and without requiring any additional power dissipation. To compare the performance advantages of the proposed pseudo-cascode compensation technique versus classical Miller compensation in a two-stage opamp with/without applying the proposed bulk-biasing technique, four opamps were fabricated on the same die in a 1-V 65-nm CMOS process. The corresponding transistors in all four opamps had equal sizes. Furthermore, all four opamps had equal total compensation capacitance and the same total power dissipation. Accordingly, compared to using Miller compensation, by applying the proposed pseudo-cascode-compensation and bulk-biasing techniques in a two-stage opamp, the opamp's dc gain is increased by a factor of 4 (12 dB), its unit-gain frequency is increased by 40%, and its phase margin is maintained over a factor of 100 scaling in its bias current. Furthermore, the overshoot in its large-signal step response is eliminated and the rise/fall settling times are improved by 33%. The trade-off is a minimal decrease in the opamp's phase margin. Importantly, this is all achieved without affecting the opamp's output-voltage swing and without requiring any additional power dissipation.},

abstract={Circuit techniques for enabling a sub-0.9 V logic-compatible embedded DRAM (eDRAM) are presented. A boosted 3T gain cell utilizes Read Word-line (RWL) preferential boosting to increase read margin and improve data retention time. Read speed is enhanced with a hybrid current/voltage sense amplifier that allows the Read Bit-line (RBL) to remain close to VDD. A regulated bit-line write scheme for driving the Write Bit-line (WBL) is equipped with a steady-state storage node voltage monitor to overcome the data `1' write disturbance problem of the PMOS gain cell without introducing another boosted supply for the Write Word-line (WWL) over-drive. An adaptive and die-to-die adjustable read reference bias generator is proposed to cope with PVT variations. Monte Carlo simulations compare the 6-sigma read and write performance of proposed eDRAM against conventional designs. Measurement results from a 64 kb eDRAM test chip implemented in a 65 nm low-leakage CMOS process show a 1.25 ms data retention time with a 2 ns random cycle time at 0.9 V, 85°C, and a 91.3 μW per Mb static power dissipation at 1.0 V, 85°C.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated UWB-IR transceiver front-end operating in the 7.25-8.5 GHz band designed for high overall transmission and detection energy efficiency and robustness to interferers. The transceiver front-end features a pulsed transmitter that wakes up when triggered by a digital signal, generates a pulse, and automatically switches-off in less than 2 ns. The receiver includes an LNA, a VGA, a squarer, a windowed integrator, and a comparator to perform PPM demodulation of the data. A prototype of the transceiver front-end was integrated in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology. The transmitter delivers 13 pJ/pulse to the antenna consuming about 190 pJ/b, with an efficiency ηT=7%, well in excess of comparable designs. Using pulse polarity scrambling, it complies with the FCC spectral emission limits up to a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 5 MHz. The receiver achieves a sensitivity of -87 dBm at a PRF of 100 kHz, and of -70 dBm at a PRF of 5 MHz, while consuming 4.2 mW. It can tolerate interferers up to -12 dBm at 5.4 GHz.},

abstract={Ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) is extensively adopted in network systems. As routing tables become larger, energy consumption and leakage current become increasingly important issues in the design of TCAM in nano-scale technologies. This work presents a novel 65 nm energy-efficient TCAM macro design for IPv6 applications. The proposed TCAM employs the concept of architecture and circuit co-design. To achieve an energy-efficient TCAM architecture, a butterfly match-line scheme and a hierarchy search-line scheme are developed to reduce significantly both the search time and power consumption. The match-lines are also implemented using noise-tolerant XOR-based conditional keepers to reduce not only the search time but also the power consumption. To reduce the increasing leakage power in advanced technologies, the proposed TCAM design utilizes two power gating techniques, namely super cut-off power gating and multi-mode data-retention power gating. An energy-efficient 256 × 144 TCAM macro is implemented using UMC 65 nm CMOS technology, and the experimental results demonstrate a leakage power reduction of 19.3% and an energy metric of the TCAM macro of 0.165 fJ/bit/search.},

abstract={Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is the key to meet the demands for data rate and link reliability of modern wireless communication systems, such as IEEE 802.11n or 3GPP-LTE. The full potential of MIMO systems can, however, only be achieved by means iterative MIMO decoding relying on soft-input soft-output (SISO) data detection. In this paper, we describe the first ASIC implementation of a SISO detector for iterative MIMO decoding. To this end, we propose a low-complexity minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) based parallel interference cancellation algorithm, develop a suitable VLSI architecture, and present a corresponding four-stream 1.5 mm2 detector chip in 90 nm CMOS technology. The fabricated ASIC includes all necessary preprocessing circuitry and exceeds the 600 Mb/s peak data-rate of IEEE 802.11n.

abstract={An ultra-low-power BPSK demodulator based on injection locked oscillators (ILOs) is introduced in this paper. Two second harmonic ILOs are employed to convert BPSK signals to ASK signals, which are then demodulated by an envelope detector to baseband. For sub-GHz applications, the ILOs are implemented using ring oscillators to allow compact chip area and ultra-low power dissipation. Bit error rate (BER) analysis of this demodulator indicates erroneous polarity flipping of demodulated bits due to phase noise of ILO. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology that consumes 228 μW of power and occupies 0.014 mm2 of die area. Measurement results reveal the demodulation of 750 MHz 5 Mb/S differential BPSK signal with sensitivity of -43 dBm. Theoretical BER analysis has been verified with erroneous flipping observed in the measurement and its probability close to the prediction.},

abstract={Several approaches to design a linear attenuator have been analyzed in terms of the transistor impedance variation, linearity, frequency responses, and circuit complexity. This paper proposes a novel method of using an adaptive bootstrapped body biasing. The method allows the attenuator to have maximum power handling capability and bandwidth without adding complexity to the circuit. A π-type variable attenuator for WCDMA transmitters has been designed and fabricated using IBM 0.18-μ m triple-well CMOS technology. The attenuator has a linear-in-dB controllability from 400 MHz to 3.7 GHz with an attenuation range of 33 dB. Its insertion loss is 0.9-2.9 dB and worst-case return loss is better than -9 dB within this frequency band. The minimum input 1-dB compression point (IP1dB) is above 7.5 dBm, and the minimum IIP3 is greater than 17 dBm at 1.95 GHz. To our knowledge, this design achieves the best linearity performance and frequency responses, and has the smallest area among similar CMOS works.},

abstract={This paper presents a low power, low voltage and low frequency bandpass filter implementation of a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for use with physiological signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) range (1-150 μV, 1-70 Hz bandwidth). Experimental results are presented for a 1 V, 7th order gmC filter based CWT with filter center frequencies ranging from 1 to 64 Hz. Low power and low frequency operation is achieved by biasing the transconductor transistors at low current levels in the deep weak inversion region. The resulting increased mismatch and reduced bandwidth are compensated for at the topology level. The filter has a 43 dB dynamic range and a 60 pW power consumption. This power consumption is three orders of magnitude lower than existing CWT implementations and assessed via a suitable figure of merit the performance is better than all considered bandpass filters. The improvement in the state-of-the-art originates from the close integration of the application requirements, CWT theory, bandpass filter design theory, and low transconductance transconductor design. These topics are described in detail.},

It achieves the lowest W- and D-band phase noise of -93 dBc/Hz at 90 GHz and -87.5 dBc/Hz at 163 GHz, both measured at a 100 kHz offset, and demonstrates an extended locking range of 80-100 GHz at the fundamental frequency, and 160-169 GHz at the second harmonic output of the push-push VCO. The single-ended PLL output power is -3 dBm at 90 GHz and -25 dBm at 164 GHz. The chip consumes 1.25 W from 1.8 V, 2.5 V, and 3.3 V supplies and occupies 1.1 mm × 1.7 mm, including pads.},

abstract={We report on the development of a 0.25-μm InP HBT IC technology for lower end of the THz frequency band (0.3-3 THz). Transistors demonstrate an extrapolated fmax of >;800 GHz while maintaining a common-emitter breakdown voltage (BVCEO) >;4 V. The transistors have been integrated in a full IC process that includes three-levels of interconnects, and backside processing. The technology has been utilized for key circuit building blocks (amplifiers, oscillators, frequency dividers, PLL, etc), all operating at ≥300 GHz. Next, we report a series of fundamental oscillators operating up to 0.57 THz fabricated in a 0.25-μm InP HBT technology. Oscillator designs are based on a differential series-tuned topology followed by a common-base buffer, in a fixed-frequency or varactor-tuned scheme. For ≥400 GHz designs, a subharmonic down-conversion mixer is integrated to facilitate spectrum measurement. At optimum bias, the measured output power was -6.2, -5.6, and -19.2 dBm, for 310.2-, 412.9-, and 573.1-GHz designs, respectively, with PDC ≤ 115 mW. Varactor-tuned designs demonstrated 10.6-12.3 GHz of tuning bandwidth up to 300 GHz.},

abstract={We present an ultrasonic transducer interface IC that includes an 8-bit, 40 Vpp, 400 mA current output DAC for arbitrary waveform transducer excitation and a ±25 V analog multiplexer. The IC was fabricated using a 0.35 μm, 50 V CMOS process. The design eliminates the need for an external power amplifier as the piezoelectric transducer is driven directly from a segmented push-pull current output DAC, which simplifies the overall system design. This approach has the advantage of simple and rapid glitch-free power-up/down, which is especially important in integrated high-output-power drivers. The DAC has been evaluated when operating at a 150 MHz sampling rate with a ±400 mA output current and a 50 Ω load. Measured performance includes 37 dB SNDR and 46 dB SFDR at 10 MHz output frequency. By implementing an additional reference DAC and extending the receiver isolation switch into an analog multiplexer, we enable on-line calibration for the purpose of reducing the driver and receiver signal path uncertainty. Measurements show a greater than ten-fold improvement in delay uncertainty to approximately 20 ps for temperature variations of 0 to 70 degrees Celsius.},

abstract={A delay-line-based analog-to-digital converter for high-speed applications is introduced. The ADC converts the sampled input voltage to a delay that controls the propagation velocity of a digital pulse. The output digital code is generated based on the propagation length of the pulse in a fixed time window. The effects of quantization noise, jitter, and mismatch are discussed. We show that because of the averaging mechanism of the delay-line, this structure is more power efficient in the presence of noise and mismatch in deep sub-micron CMOS. To show the feasibility of this approach, a 4 bit 1.2 GS/s ADC is designed and fabricated in 65 nm CMOS in an active area of 110 μm × 105 μm. The measured INL and DNL of the ADC are below 0.8 bits and 0.5 bits and it achieves an SNDR of 20.4 dB at Nyquist rate. This delay-line-based ADC consumes 2 mW of power from a 1.2 V supply resulting in 196 fJ/conversion step without using any calibration or post-processing.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2514-2523}, 
abstract={Linear amplification with nonlinear components (LINC) is an attractive technique for achieving linear amplification with high efficiency. This paper presents a sub-mW all-digital signal component separator (SCS) design for OFDM LINC transmitters, including a phase calculator and a digital-control phase shifter (DCPS) pair. In addition, a digital mismatch compensation scheme is proposed and integrated into the SCS to reduce the design complexity of the power amplifier. This chip is manufactured in a 90 nm standard CMOS process with an active area of 0.06 mm2. The DCPS can generate phase-modulated signals at 100 MHz with 8-bit resolution and RMS error 9.33 ps (0.34°). The phase calculation can be performed at a maximum speed of 50 MHz using a 0.5 V supply voltage, resulting in a 73.88% power reduction. Comparing to state-of-the-art, the power consumption of the overall SCS is only 949.5 μW which minimizes the power overhead for an LINC transmitter. This SCS with the branch mismatch compensation provides a 0.02 dB gain and 0.15° phase fine-tune resolution without adding additional front-end circuits. Considering 1 dB gain and 10° phase mismatch, the system EVM of - 29.81 dB and ACPR of - 34.56 dB can still be achieved for 5 MHz bandwidth 64-QAM OFDM signals.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1296-1306}, 
abstract={A low power wireless transceiver has been presented for near-field data transmission across inductive telemetry links, which operates based on pulse harmonic modulation (PHM). This PHM transceiver uses on-off keying (OOK) of a pattern of pulses to suppress inter-symbol interference (ISI), and its characteristics are suitable for low-power high-bandwidth telemetry in implantable neuroprosthetic devices. To transmit each bit across a pair of high-Q LC-tank circuits, the PHM transmitter generates a string of narrow pulses with specific amplitudes and timing. Each pulse generates a decaying oscillation at the harmonic frequency that the receiver LC-tank is tuned at, which is then superimposed with other oscillations across the receiver at the same frequency, to minimize the ISI. This allows for reaching high data rates without reducing the inductive link quality factor (to extend its bandwidth), which significantly improves the range and selectivity of the link. The PHM receiver architecture is based on non-coherent energy detection with programmable bandwidth and adjustable gain. The PHM transceiver was fabricated in a 0.5- μm standard CMOS process, occupying 1.8 mm2. The transceiver achieved a measured 10.2 Mbps data rate with a bit error rate (BER) of 6.3×10-8 at 1 cm distance using planar implant sized (1 cm2) figure-8 coils. The PHM transmitter power consumption was 345 pJ/bit and 8.85 pJ/bit at 1 cm and zero link distances, respectively. The receiver dissipates 3 mW at 3.3 V supply voltage.},

title={A 100 MHz Ladder FeRAM Design With Capacitance-Coupled-Bitline (CCB) Cell}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={3}, 
pages={681-689}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a new ladder FeRAM ar chitecture with capacitance-coupled-bitline (CCB) cells for high-end embedded applications. The ladder FeRAM architecture short-circuits both electrodes of each ferroelectric capacitor at every standby cycle. This overcomes the fatal disturbance problem inherent to the CCB cell, and halves read/write cycle time by sharing a plateline and its driver with 32 cells in two neighboring ladder blocks. This configuration realizes small 0.35 μm2 cell using a highly reliable ferroelectric capacitor of as large as 0.145 μm2 size, and a highly compatible process with logic-LSI. A slow plateline drive of the CCB cell due to a resistive plateline using an active area is minimized to 2.5 ns by introducing thick M3 shunt-path and distributed M3 platelines. The area penalty of the shunt is 4.7% of an array. A serious bitline-to-bitline coupling noise in edge bitlines up to the noise/signal ratio of 0.38 due to the operation peculiar to FeRAM is eliminated by introducing activated dummy bitlines and their sense amplifiers. The design of 16 cells in a ladder block is optimal for effective cell size, cell signal, and active power dissipation. A new early plateline pull-down read scheme omits "0"-data rewrite operation without read disturbance. A 64 Kb ladder FeRAM with the CCB cells and the early plateline pull-down read scheme achieves a fast random read/write of 10 ns cycle and 8 ns access at 150°C.},

abstract={A 4-port-inductor-based voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) coupling technique is introduced to improve VCO phase noise performance. The analysis of the stability of oscillation modes and the phase noise performance of a coupled oscillator is provided as theoretical fundamental. Four-port inductors are compared with typical two-port inductors, and their superior performance over the latter is demonstrated through analysis and measurements. The design strategies of coupled VCOs using 4-port inductors are discussed. Two coupled VCO topologies, the NMOS-cross-coupled-pair coupled VCO (NCVCO) and the complementary-cross-coupled-pair coupled VCO (CCVCO), are proposed and compared with the conventional NMOS-cross-coupled-pair VCO (NVCO). Prototype designs have been demonstrated to verify the analysis. The 12.8-GHz CCVCO design achieves phase noise of -116 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset, a tuning range of 31.4%, and FOM and FOMT of 184 and 194, respectively.},

abstract={This paper reports a 176×144-pixel smart image sensor designed and fabricated in a 0.35 CMOS-OPTO process. The chip implements a massively parallel focal-plane processing array which can output different simplified representations of the scene at very low power. The array is composed of pixel-level processing elements which carry out analog image processing concurrently with photosensing. These processing elements can be grouped into fully-programmable rectangular-shape areas by loading the appropriate interconnection patterns into the registers at the edge of the array. The targeted processing can be thus performed block-wise. Readout is done pixel-by-pixel in a random access fashion. On-chip 8b ADC is provided. The image processing primitives implemented by the chip, experimentally tested and fully functional, are scale space and Gaussian pyramid generation, fully-programmable multiresolution scene representation-including foveation-and block-wise energy-based scene representation. The power consumption associated to the capture, processing and A/D conversion of an image flow at 30 fps, with full-frame processing but reduced frame size output, ranges from 2.7 mW to 5.6 mW, depending on the operation to be performed.},

pages={1183-1197}, 
abstract={Fractionally spaced linear receive equalization (FSE) is shown in this work as an effective method to perform joint equalization and phase-synchronization in mesochronous high-speed links. Given an arbitrary receive sampling phase, a modified sign-sign least mean squares (M-SSLMS) adaptive algorithm is developed to tune the FSE tap weights to mitigate the inter-symbol interference (ISI), avoiding the divergence issue in the standard sign-sign least mean squares (SSLMS) algorithm. To achieve the desired linearity with good energy efficiency and large input dynamic range, an FSE is implemented using a voltage-time conversion technique by inverter-based threshold detectors with auto-zeroing function. The two-tap quad-rate FSE receiver with one-tap DFE is fabricated in 90 nm bulk CMOS technology, occupying 0.03 mm 2 active area. With a 1.2 V supply, it achieves a 6.25 Gb/s rate, 3.6 mW/Gb/s efficiency and over 4 bits of linearity.},

First, an array architecture and data path design of 128 Mb chain FeRAM to meet HDD specifications, and a total power supply system for HDD application are presented. A 1.6 GB/s read/write bandwidth with page length of 512 Byte HDD sector size, and the data protection against sudden power failure have been realized. Second, the concept of nonvolatile FeRAM cache to utilize cache memory to the maximum by ignoring flush cache commands issued from Windows OS is presented. Third, the simulated and measured HDD performance improvements are demonstrated. The read/write bandwidth improvements by 1.12 times, 3.3 times and 1.9 times have been verified by two benchmark tests of PC Mark 05 and the copy of FD Bench v1.01, and by simulation using the PC user data for five days, respectively. These results are at the same levels of, or more effective than, the results of HDD disk rotational speed-up from 5400 rpm to 7200 rpm using a DRAM cache. The write energy is also reduced by 25% in PC Mark05 test.},

pages={1585-1595}, 
abstract={This paper presents an asynchronous SAR ADC for flexible, low energy radios. To achieve excellent power efficiency for a relatively moderate resolution, various techniques are introduced to reduce the power consumption: custom-designed 0.5 fF unit capacitors minimize the analog power consumption while asynchronous dynamic logic minimizes the digital power consumption. The variability of the custom-designed capacitors is estimated by a specialized CAD tool and verified by chip measurements. An implemented 8-bit prototype in a 90 nm CMOS technology occupies 228 μm × 240 μm including decoupling capacitors, and achieves an ENOB of 7.77 bit at a sampling frequency of 10.24 MS/s. The power consumption equals 26.3 μW from a 1 V supply, thus resulting in an energy efficiency of 12 fJ/conversion-step. Moreover, the fully dynamic design, which is optimized for low-leakage, leads to a standby power consumption of 6 nW. In that way, the energy efficiency of this converter can be maintained down to very low sampling rates.},

abstract={A 2×2 array of 280-GHz Schottky-barrier diode detectors with an on-chip patch antenna (255 × 250 μm2) is fabricated in a 130-nm logic CMOS process. The series resistance of diode is minimized using poly-gate separation (PGS), and exhibits a cut-off frequency of 2 THz. Each detector unit can detect an incident carrier with 100-Hz ~ 2-MHz amplitude modulation. At 1-MHz modulation frequency, the estimated voltage responsivity and noise equivalent power (NEP) of the detector unit are 250 V/W and 33 pW/Hz1/2, respectively. An integrated low-noise amplifier further boosts the responsivity to 80 kV/W. At supply voltage of 1.2 V, the entire chip consumes 1.6 mW. The array occupies 1.5 × 0.8 mm2. A set of millimeter-wave images with a signal-noise ratio of 48 dB is formed using the detector.

abstract={The design of a low-voltage low-power fourth-order single-bit continuous-time Delta-Sigma modulator is presented in this paper for audio applications. The modulator employs an input-feedforward topology in order to reduce internal signal swings, thus relaxes the linearity and slew rate requirements on amplifiers leading to low-voltage operation and low-power consumption. The energy efficiency is further improved by embedding the summation of feedforward paths into the quantizer. For low-voltage operation, a gain-enhanced fully-differential amplifier and a body-driven rail-to-rail input CMFB circuit are developed. The modulator, implemented in a 0.13-μm standard CMOS technology with a core area of 0.11 mm2, achieves an 82-dB dynamic range (DR), and a 79.1-dB peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 20-kHz signal bandwidth. The power consumption of the modulator is 28.6 μW under a 0.6-V supply voltage. The achieved performance make it one of the best among state-of-the-art sub-1-V modulators in terms of two widely used figures of merit.},

abstract={Low voltage operation of digital circuits continues to be an attractive option for aggressive power reduction. As standard SRAM bitcells are limited to operation in the strong-inversion regimes due to process variations and local mismatch, the development of specially designed SRAMs for low voltage operation has become popular in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel 9T bitcell, implementing a Supply Feedback concept to internally weaken the pull-up current during write cycles and thus enable low-voltage write operations. As opposed to the majority of existing solutions, this is achieved without the need for additional peripheral circuits and techniques. The proposed bitcell is fully functional under global and local variations at voltages from 250 mV to 1.1 V. In addition, the proposed cell presents a low-leakage state reducing power up to 60%, as compared to an identically supplied 8T bitcell. An 8 kbit SF-SRAM array was implemented and fabricated in a low-power 40 nm process, showing full functionality and ultra-low power.},

abstract={This paper describes an activity-dependent intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) system-on-chip (SoC) that converts extracellular neural spikes recorded from one brain region to electrical stimuli delivered to another brain region in real time in vivo. The 10.9-mm2 SoC incorporates two identical 4-channel modules, each comprising an analog recording front-end with total input noise voltage of 3.12 μVrms and noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.68, 5.9-μW 10-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADCs), 12.4-μW digital spike discrimination processor, and a programmable constant-current microstimulating back-end that delivers up to 94.5 μA with 6-bit resolution to stimulate the cortical tissue when triggered by neural activity. For autonomous operation, the SoC also integrates biasing and clock generation circuitry, frequency-shift-keyed (FSK) transmitter at 433 MHz, and dc-dc converter that generates a power supply of 5.05 V for the microstimulating back-end from a single 1.5-V battery. Measured results from electrical performance characterization and biological experiments with anesthetized rats are presented from a prototype chip fabricated in AMS 0.35 μm two-poly four-metal (2P/4M) CMOS.

abstract={This paper presents a 30 Gb/s/link 2.2 Tb/s/mm2 inductive-coupling link for a high-speed DRAM interface. The data rate per layout area is the highest among DRAM interfaces reported up to now. The proposed interface employs a high-speed injection-locking CDR technique that utilizes the derivative property of inductive coupling. Compared to conventional injection-locking CDR based on an XOR edge detector, the proposed technique doubles the operation speed and increases the data rate to 30 Gb/s/link. As a result, the data rate per layout area is increased to 2.2 Tb/s/mm2 , which is 2X that of the state-of-the-art inductive-coupling link, and 22X that of the state-of-the-art wired link.},

pages={353-364}, 
abstract={A low power highly sensitive Thoracic Impedance Variance (TIV) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring SoC is designed and implemented into a poultice-like plaster sensor for wearable cardiac monitoring. 0.1 Ω TIV detection is possible with a sensitivity of 3.17 V/Ω and SNR > 40 dB. This is achieved with the help of a high quality (Q-factor > 30) balanced sinusoidal current source and low noise reconfigurable readout electronics. A cm-range 13.56 MHz fabric inductor coupling is adopted to start/stop the SoC remotely. Moreover, a 5% duty-cycled Body Channel Communication (BCC) is exploited for 0.2 nJ/b 1 Mbps energy efficient external data communication. The proposed SoC occupies 5 mm × 5 mm including pads in a standard 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS technology. It dissipates a peak power of 3.9 mW when operating in body channel receiver mode, and consumes 2.4 mW when operating in TIV and ECG detection mode. The SoC is integrated on a 15 cm × 15 cm fabric circuit board together with a flexible battery to form a compact wearable sensor. With 25 adhesive screen-printed fabric electrodes, detection of TIV and ECG at 16 different sites of the heart is possible, allowing optimal detection sites to be configured to accommodate different user dependencies.},

abstract={A new bit-line sense amplifier for improving performance in the presence of data-pattern-dependent sensing noise is analyzed. The proposed scheme utilizes the power drop phenomenon in the sense amplifier driving line, resulting in an 81.5% reduction in the amplitude of data-pattern-dependent sensing noise. It is very important to accurately model power drop in compensating data-pattern-dependent sensing noise. Simulation and measurement of the proposed sensing scheme show improvement of sensing noise over a conventional bit-line sense amplifier.

year={2011}, 
volume={46},

pages={1198-1213}, 
abstract={This study demonstrates a 6-GHz triangular-modulated spread-spectrum clock generator (SSCG) based on a fractional-N PLL in a 90-nm CMOS process. This paper presents a phase-rotating technique to create the fractional-N topology for the SSCG and implement spread-spectrum clocking (SSC) by modulating the fractional-N ratios. The proposed phase-rotating technique consists of virtual multiphase generation and the phase compensation approach. This technique effectively compensates the instantaneous timing error and shows the ignorable quantization error. Unlike the delta-sigma technique commonly used for SSCGs, the proposed SSCG realizes non-dithered fractional division ratios. In terms of SSC, this approach suppresses the RMS jitter to less than 1 ps, showing a significant improvement in the jitter performance in this work. The measured power attenuation of electromagnetic interference (EMI) is 16.12 dB, with a deviation of less than 0.5% (5000 ppm). Operating at a 6-GHz clock rate, the measured RMS jitter with and without the down-spreading spectrum are 0.77 and 0.71 ps, respectively. The chip core area is less than 0.55 × 0.45 mm2 and the core power consumption is 27.7 mW at a supply of 1.0 V.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and implementation of an analog signal processor (ASP) ASIC for portable ECG monitoring systems. The ASP ASIC performs four major functionalities: 1) ECG signal extraction with high resolution, 2) ECG signal feature extraction, 3) adaptive sampling ADC for the compression of ECG signals, 4) continuous-time electrode-tissue impedance monitoring for signal integrity monitoring. These functionalities enable the development of wireless ECG monitoring systems that have significantly lower power consumption yet that are more capable than their predecessors. The ASP has been implemented in 0.5 μm CMOS process and consumes 30 μW from a 2 V supply. The noise density of the ECG readout channel is 85 nV/√Hz and the CMRR is better that 105 dB. The adaptive sampling ADC is capable of compressing the ECG data by a factor of 7 and the heterodyne chopper readout extracts the features of the ECG signals. Combination of these two features leads to a factor 4 reduction in the power consumption of a wireless ECG monitoring system. Furthermore, the proposed continuous-time impedance monitoring circuit enables the monitoring of the signal integrity.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1464-1477}, 
abstract={A power-efficient, high-frequency, automatic reconfigurable switching converter is presented in this paper for DVS-enabled VLSI systems. Tailored to the system-level power management, the proposed cross-layered green-mode (GM) operation scheme adaptively configures the converter into three operation structures to achieve a seamless step-up/down voltage conversion with minimized power loss. In addition, an adaptive power transistor sizing (APTS) scheme is incorporated to further improve efficiency on the transistor level. To enable high-frequency operation in all power regulation conditions, an i L-assisted single-bound hysteresis controller (SBHC) is also proposed in this work. Meanwhile, in order to suppress output spectrum variations induced by the hysteresis controller, an adaptive frequency compensator (AFC) is employed. The proposed converter was fabricated with IBM 130-nm CMOS process, with a total chip area of 1 mm2. Its output voltage can be seamlessly regulated from 0.9 to 2.2 V, with a maximum load power of 400 mW. The input voltage is designed at 1.5 V, but is variable at any level between 0.9 and 1.8 V. The switching frequency of the converter is regulated at 10 MHz in all three operation modes, with ±3% deviation. Experimental results show a 26.7- μs/V down-tracking and 93.3-μs/V up-tracking speed for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) reference tracking. Line regulation is maintained below 0.8% throughout the full input voltage range, with a lowest value of 0.17%. The power efficiency stays above 80% over the entire 400-mW power range, with a peak value of 92.1% at 1.2-V output and 250-mW load power.},

An LO generation scheme using a frequency tripler is proposed to lower the PLL frequency, making it suitable for use in multi-pixel systems. In addition, the noise performance of the receiver is further improved by optimum biasing of transistors of the detector in moderate inversion region to achieve the highest responsivity and lowest NEP. The front-end chipset exhibits a measured peak gain of 35 dB, -3 dB BW of 12 GHz, NF of 8.9 dB, while consuming 94 mW.

It achieves - 102-dBc/Hz phase noise at 50-kHz offset and a total absolute jitter below 560 fsrms (integrated from 3 kHz to 30 MHz), even in the worst-case of a -42-dBc in-band fractional spur. The synthesizer tuning range spans from 2.92 GHz to 4.05 GHz with 70-Hz resolution. The total power consumption is 4.5 mW, which leads to the best jitter-power trade-off obtained with a fractional-N synthesizer. The synthesizer demonstrates the capability of frequency modulation up to 1.25-Mb/s data rate.},

This method finds the best topology to achieve frequencies close to the fmax of the transistors. It also determines the maximum frequency of oscillation for a fixed circuit topology, considering the quality factor of the passive components. Using this technique, in a 0.13 μm CMOS process, we design and implement 121 GHz and 104 GHz fundamental oscillators with the output power of -3.5 dBm and -2.7 dBm, respectively. Next, we introduce a novel triple-push structure to realize 256 GHz and 482 GHz oscillators. The 256 GHz oscillator was implemented in a 0.13 μm CMOS process and the output power of -17 dBm was measured. The 482 GHz oscillator generates -7.9 dBm (0.16 mW) in a 65 nm CMOS process.},

abstract={A novel variable inductor using a bridge circuit is proposed. Because of a bypass switch MOSFET placed at a balance point, the effect of the switch resistance which is a penalty of the variable inductance is suppressed and degradation of the Q factor is mitigated. A 10-20 GHz tunable LC-VCO core using this inductor was also fabricated. Because of the multi-stage variable inductor, 20 GHz operation having over 10 GHz continuous tuning range with phase noise of -103 to -84 dBc/Hz is achieved with only 5.2 to 7.1 mW power consumption. By using a 1/2 divider, a 5-20 GHz continuous tuning range is also obtained. The chip area is 1/10 smaller than that of conventional wide range LC-VCOs because of the miniature 3-D structure variable inductor. This variable inductor and the wide range LC-VCO are suit able for the clock generation of high-speed communication systems, multi-core processors, as well as low-power, low-cost wireless transceivers.},

title={A 76 dB$Omega $ 1.7 GHz 0.18 $mu$ m CMOS Tunable TIA Using Broadband Current Pre-Amplifier for High Frequency Lateral MEMS Oscillators}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={1}, 
pages={224-235}, 
abstract={This paper reports on the design and characterization of a high-gain tunable transimpedance amplifier (TIA) suitable for gigahertz oscillators that use high-Q lateral micromechanical resonators with large motional resistance and large shunt parasitic capacitance. The TIA consists of a low-power broadband current pre-amplifler combined with a current-to-voltage conversion stage to boost the input current before delivering it to feedback voltage amplifiers. Using this approach, the TIA achieves a constant gain of 76 dB-Ohm up to 1.7 GHz when connected to a 2 pF load at the input and output with an input-referred noise below 10 pA/√(Hz) in the 100 MHz to 1 GHz range. The TIA is fabricated in a 1P6M 0.18 μm CMOS process and consumes 7.2 mW. To demonstrate its performance in high frequency lateral micromechanical oscillator applications, the TIA is wirebonded to a 724 MHz high-motional resistance (Qunloaded ≈ 2000, Rm ≈ 750 Ω, CP ≈ 2 pF) and a 1.006 GHz high-parasitic (Qunloaded ≈ 7100, Rm ≈ 150 Ω, CP ≈ 3.2 pF) AIN-on-Silicon resonator. The 724 MHz and 1.006 GHz oscillators achieve phase-noise better than -87 dBc/Hz and -94 dBc/Hz @ 1 kHz offset, respectively, with a floor around -154 dBc/Hz. The 1.006 GHz oscillator achieves the highest reported figure of merit (FoM) among lateral piezoelectric micromechanical oscillators and meets the phase-noise requirements for most 2G and 3G cellular standards including GSM 900 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, and HSDPA.},

abstract={In this paper, a simultaneous body and word-line biasing control scheme is described for minimizing the cell leakage current in DRAMs. In the proposed biasing scheme, both the reverse body and negative word-line bias voltages are simultaneously controlled in real time by monitoring the leakage current of a group of replica DRAM cells in different leakage conditions.

abstract={This paper describes the design and implementation of an all-digital clock and data recovery circuit (ADCDR) for multigigabit/s operation. The proposed digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) incorporating a supply-controlled ring oscillator with a digitally-controlled resistor (DCR) generates wide-frequency-range multiphase clocks with fine resolution. With an adaptive proportional gain controller (APGC) which continuously adjusts a proportional gain, the proposed ADCDR recovers data with a low-jitter clock and tracks large input jitter rapidly, resulting in enhanced jitter performance. A digital frequency-acquisition loop with a proportional control greatly reduces acquisition time. Fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process with a 1.2-V supply, the ADCDR occupies 0.074 mm2 and operates from 1.0 Gb/s to 4.0 Gb/s with a bit error rate of less than 10-14. At a 3.0-Gb/s 231 - 1 PRBS, the measured jitter in the recovered clock is 3.59 psrms and 29.4 pspp, and the power consumption is 11.4 mW.},

abstract={A digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) employs a linear proportional path, a double integral path, bandwidth and tuning range tracking; and a novel delta-sigma digital to analog converter to achieve low jitter, wide operating range and low power. The proposed proportional path decouples the detector quantization error and oscillator noise bandwidth tradeoff and helps maximize bandwidth to suppress digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) phase noise in a power efficient manner. A double integral path alleviates the tradeoff between DCO tuning range and its frequency quantization error. The high resolution of the DCO was maintained over a wide range of sampling clock frequencies by using a delta-sigma digital to analog converter and a continuously tunable switched-RC filter. Bandwidth and tuning range tracking are employed to achieve low jitter over the entire operating range. The prototype DPLL, fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, operates from 0.7 GHz to 3.5 GHz.

abstract={A dual active-capacitive-feedback compensation (DACFC) scheme for low-power three-stage amplifiers with large capacitive loads is presented in this paper. Dual high-speed active-capacitive-feedback paths enable the non-dominant complex poles of the amplifier to be located at high frequencies for bandwidth extension under low-power condition. The proposed DACFC amplifier also consists of two left-half-plane (LHP) zeros that relax the stability criteria for further improving the gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and reducing the required compensation capacitance of the amplifier. Moreover, the transient response of the DACFC amplifier is enhanced via the use of the small compensation capacitance and the presence of push-pull second and output stages. Two three-stage amplifiers using the proposed DACFC and the well-known nested Miller compensation (NMC) have been implemented in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS process. The proposed DACFC amplifier uses a total compensation capacitance of 2.2 pF and is robust in stability with a phase margin of >;58° under the variation of the load capacitance between 300 pF and 800 pF. When driving a 500-pF//25-kΩ load, the DACFC three-stage amplifier improves the GBW-to-power by 66 times, enhances the slew rate-to-power by 51 times, and reduces the chip area by 33 times, as compared to the conventional NMC counterpart.},

abstract={A MOS-input operational amplifier has a reconfigurable input stage that enables trimming of both offset and offset drift based only on single-temperature measurements. The input stage consists of a MOS differential pair, whose offset drift is predicted from offset voltage measurements made at well-defined bias currents. A theoretical motivation for this approach is presented and validated experimentally by characterizing the offset of pairs of discrete MOS transistors as a function of bias current and temperature. An opamp using the proposed single-temperature trimming technique has been designed and fabricated in a 0.5 μm BiCMOS process. After single-temperature trimming, it achieves a maximum offset of ± 30 μV and an offset drift of 0.33 μV/°C (3σ) over the temperature range of -40°C to +125°C.},

pages={3113-3125}, 
abstract={A new interconnect solution with plastic waveguide is demonstrated. The system consists of a pair of transceivers and a plastic waveguide. Millimeter wave signal is transmitted in a low-cost long piece of solid plastic dielectric acting as a waveguide. The plastic waveguide medium offers a large bandwidth for data communication using mm-wave carrier frequencies. Plastic waveguide interconnects do not require costly electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical conversion devices or precise alignment and offer longer transmission distances than wireless solutions due to better field confinement and lower path loss. Multiple plastic waveguides can be used in parallel and the modulated data at different frequencies can be multiplexed to increase the data rate. The demonstrated transceiver chips operate at carrier frequencies of 57 GHz and 80 GHz, and are fabricated in 40 nm low-power logic CMOS. The total area and power consumption of two transceivers are 0.41 mm2 and 140 mW, respectively. The fabricated demonstrator with Yagi-couplers achieves full-duplex transmission of 12.5 Gb/s ASK modulated signal in each direction over the 120 mm polystyrene waveguide with no equalization. The observed bit error rates for both channels are less than 10-12 for a PRBS length of 27-1 at the total data rate of 25 Gb/s. This paper shows the feasibility of the plastic waveguide interconnect as a promising alternative to electrical, optical, and wireless interconnects.},

abstract={This paper proposes an architecture and design approach for the realization of wideband millimeter-wave frequency synthesizers. This architecture uses two-step multi-order harmonic generation of a low frequency phase-locked signal to generate wideband millimeter-wave frequencies. The first step is implemented using a multi-order digital harmonic synthesis block combined with a multi-phase injection-locked oscillator. A variable N-push frequency multiplier uses the output of the oscillator to implement the second harmonic generation step. A prototype of the proposed system is designed and fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology. Measurements show that using a phase-locked input signal of 1-1.43 GHz, the system can provide an output which covers the frequency range of 5-32 GHz. This represents a tuning bandwidth of 27 GHz with a tuning range of 146%. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is -116 dBc/Hz and -99 dBc/Hz at 5 GHz and 32 GHz, respectively.},

abstract={Variations in the number and characteristics of charges or traps contributing to transistor degradation lead to a distribution of device “ages” at any given time. This issue is well understood in the study of time dependent dielectric breakdown, but is just beginning to be thoroughly addressed under bias temperature instability (BTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) stress. In this paper, we present a measurement system that facilitates efficient statistical aging measurements involving the latter two mechanisms in an array of ring oscillators. Microsecond measurements for minimal BTI recovery, as well as frequency shift measurement resolution ranging down to the error floor of 0.07% are achieved with three beat frequency detection systems working in tandem. Measurement results from a 65 nm test chip show that fresh frequency and the stress-induced shift are uncorrelated, both the mean and standard deviation of that shift increase with stress, and the standard deviation/mean ratio decreases with stress time.},

abstract={The increased resolution of Quad Full High Definition (QFHD) offers significantly enhanced visual experience. However, the corresponding huge data throughput of up to 530 Mpixels/s greatly challenges the design of real-time video decoder VLSI with the extensive requirement on both DRAM bandwidth and computational power. In this work, a lossless frame recompression technique and a partial MB reordering scheme are proposed to save the DRAM access of a QFHD video decoder chip. Besides, pipelining and parallelization techniques such as NAL/slice-parallel entropy decoding are implemented to efficiently enhance its computational power. The chip supporting H.264/AVC high profile is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS and verified. It delivers a maximum throughput of 4096×2160@60fps, which is at least 4.3 times higher than the state-of-the-art. DRAM bandwidth requirement is reduced by typically 51%, which fits the design into a 64-bit LPDDR SDRAM interface and results in 58% DRAM power saving. Meanwhile, the core energy is saved by 54% by pipelining and parallelization.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={1}, 
pages={42-51}, 
abstract={A heterogeneous many-core object recognition processor is proposed to realize robust and efficient object recognition on real-time video of cluttered scenes. Unlike previous approaches that simply aimed for high GOPS/W, we aim to achieve high Effective GOPS/W, or EGOPS/W, which only counts operations carried out on meaningful regions of an input image. This is achieved by the Unified Visual Attention Model (UVAM) which confines complex Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature extraction to meaningful object regions while rejecting meaningless background regions. The Intelligent Inference Engine (HE), a mixed-mode neuro-fuzzy inference system, performs the top-down familiarity attention of the UVAM which guides attention toward pre-learned objects. Weight perturbation-based learning of the HE ensures high attention precision through online adaptation. The SIFT recognition is accelerated by an optimized array of 420-way SIMD Vector Processing Elements, 32 MIMD Scalar Processing Elements, and 1 Feature Matching Processor. When processing 30 fps 640 × 480 video, the 50 mm2 object recognition processor implemented in a 0.13 μm process achieves 246 EGOPS/W, which is 46 % higher than the previous work. The average power consumption is only 345 mW.},

abstract={This paper proposes a 60 GHz quadrature PLL frequency synthesizer for the IEEE802.15.3c with wide tuning range and low phase noise. The synthesizer is constructed using a 20 GHz PLL that is coupled with a Quadrature Injection Locked Oscillator (QILO) as a frequency tripler to generate the 60 GHz signal. The 20 GHz PLL generates a signal with a phase noise that is lower than -105 dBc/Hz using tail feedback to improve the phase noise while having a 17% tuning range. The proposed 60 GHz QILO uses a combination of parallel and tail injection to enhance the locking range by improving the QILO injection efficiency at the moment of injection and has a 12% tuning range. Both the 20 GHz PLL and the QILO were fabricated as separate chips using a 65 nm CMOS process and measurement results show a phase noise that is less than -95 dBc/Hz@1 MHz at 60 GHz while consuming 80 mW from a 1.2 V supply. To the author's knowledge this phase noise is about 20 dB better than recently reported QPLLs and about 10 dB compared to differential PLLs operating at a similar frequency and at a similar offset.},

abstract={A 2.4 GHz outphasing power amplifier (PA) is implemented in a 32 nm CMOS process. An inverter-based class-D PA topology is utilized to obtain low output impedance and good linearity in the outphasing system. MOS switch non-idealities, such as finite on-resistance and finite rise and fall times are analyzed for their impact on outphasing linearity and efficiency. Outphasing combining is performed via a transformer configured to achieve reduced loss at power backoff. The fabricated class-D outphasing PA delivers 25.3 dBm peak CW power with 35% total system Power Added Efficiency (includes all drivers). Average OFDM power is 19.6 dBm with efficiency 21.8% when transmitting WiFi signals with no linearization required. The PA is packaged in a flip-chip BGA package. Good linearity performance (ACPR and EVM) demonstrates the applicability of inverter-based class-D amplifiers for outphasing configurations.},

abstract={The design of a 60-Gb/s CMOS driver with input signal retiming is analyzed theoretically and validated experimentally. The output stage employs a modified distributed amplifier (DA) architecture with summation of both low-pass and reactively coupled bandpass signal paths along a 50-Ω output transmission line. The DA features digital variable gain amplifier (DVGA) cells to achieve broadband waveshape control with adjustable pre-emphasis at three different peaking frequencies. Binary-weighted MOSFET gate-finger groupings are employed in a Gilbert-cell based DVGA topology to minimize bit-dependent output impedance and group delay variations. S -parameter measurements of the retimed driver show 54-dB gain, while the standalone DA exhibits approximately 10 dB of peaking control in each of the three frequency bands. Input and output return loss is better than -10 dB up to 60 GHz. The circuit operates from 1.2- and 2-V supplies and achieves a throughput efficiency of 12.2 mW/Gb/s. Equalization experiments at 40 Gb/s demonstrate compensation of various channel characteristics, including over 12 feet of cascaded coaxial cables with 21 dB loss at 20 GHz.},

abstract={This work presents a low-complexity IR-UWB chipset which achieves synchronization and demodulation at the receiver relying only on a ring oscillator clock. The modulation scheme used, synchronized-OOK (S-OOK), permits low power timing acquisition and data reception with a static CMOS digital synchronizer and demodulator counting 61 logic elements. The receiver consists of a modified energy detector (ED) that allows to asynchronously receive UWB pulses in presence of narrowband interference (NBI) with power levels up to -5 and -16 dBm for 5.4 and 2.4 GHz continuous wave interfering signals respectively. The sensitivity is -60/ -66 dBm with an overall energy dissipation of 2.9/3.9 nJ/bit for a 1 Mbps S-OOK PRBS data stream and a 100% power duty cycle. The complete demodulation and synchronization digital back-end consumes only 0.2 mW (including on-chip output buffers) during normal operation. The IR-UWB transmitter is based on a gated LC oscillator and achieves pulse durations of ~2 ns for bandwidths of 500 MHz. It consumes 249 pJ/bit energy per bit at 1 Mbps OOK.},

abstract={A direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) using an analog-sine-mapping technique is presented in a 0.35-μm SiGe BiCMOS process. We intend to apply the translinear principle to develop a triangle-to-sine converter (TSC) that can achieve outputs with low harmonic content. The TSC is introduced for the DDFS to translate phase data to sine wave. Using this analog-interpolating technique, the DDFS, with 9 bits of phase resolution and 8 bits of amplitude resolution, can achieve operation at 5-GHz clock frequency and can further reduce power consumption and die area. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the DDFS is better than 48 dBc at low synthesized frequencies, decreasing to 45.7 dBc worst case at the Nyquist synthesized frequency for output frequency band (0-2.5 GHz). The DDFS consumes 460 mW at a 3.3-V supply and achieves a high power efficiency figure of merit (FOM) of 10.87 GHz/W. The chip occupies 1.5 × 1.4 mm2.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={5}, 
pages={998-1010}, 
abstract={A differential single-port switched-RC N-path filter with band-pass characteristic is proposed. The switching frequency defines the center frequency, while the RC-time and duty cycle of the clock define the bandwidth. This allows for high-Q highly tunable filters which can for instance be useful for cognitive radio. Using a linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) model, exact expressions for the filter transfer function are derived. The behavior of the circuit including non-idealities such as maximum rejection, spectral aliasing, noise and effects due to mismatch in the paths is modeled and verified via measurements. A simple RLC equivalent circuit is provided, modeling bandwidth, quality factor and insertion loss of the filter. A 4-path architecture is realized in 65 nm CMOS. An off-chip transformer acts as a balun, improves filter-Q and realizes impedance matching. The differential architecture reduces clock-leakage and suppresses selectivity around even harmonics of the clock. The filter has a constant -3 dB bandwidth of 35 MHz and can be tuned from 100 MHz up to 1 GHz. Over the whole band, IIP3 is better than 14 dBm, P1dB=2 dBm and the noise figure is 3-5 dB, while the power dissipation increases from 2 mW to 16 mW (only clocking power).},

abstract={A wide-bandwidth phase modulation transmitter with phase quantization noise cancellation technique is proposed. Unlike conventional phase-locked loop closed-loop modulation, very wide-bandwidth arbitrary phase modulation can be synthesized at the phase-locked loop output by selecting the desired phases that are generated by a phase generator. To further reduce the phase quantization noise due to the finite number of available phases, a phase quantization noise cancellation path is proposed through a second VCO control port. At least 7 dB phase noise cancellation was demonstrated using a prototype 0.18 μm CMOS 2.4 GHz GFSK transmitter integrated circuit. Measurements on the prototype show that out-of-band phase quantization noise is 49 dB lower than the signal when transmitting 20 Mb/s GFSK signal and that the rms error is only 3.2%. The current consumption is 34.5 mA excluding the transmitter output buffer.},

abstract={We propose a new multirate architecture of an all-digital PLL (ADPLL) featuring phase/frequency modulation capability. While the ADPLL approach has already proven its benefits of power dissipation and cost reduction through the discrete-time operation and full RF-SoC integration in nanoscale CMOS, the coarse discretization of the phase detector function tends to keep it from reaching the ultimate of the RF performance potential. The proposed ADPLL features an arbitrarily high data rate modulation that is independent from the reference frequency. It is also made substantially free from injection pulling and ill-shaped quantization noise of the TDC by means of dithering with dynamic adjustment of differential pair mismatches as well as frequency translation of the feedback clock. Low power techniques, such as speculative clock retiming and asynchronous counter are used. The presented ADPLL is implemented in 65 nm CMOS as part of a single-chip GSM/EDGE RF-SoC. It occupies 0.35 mm2 and consumes 32 mA of current at 1.2 V supply in the low frequency band. The measured results show a virtually spur-free operation.},

abstract={An energy-efficient 920 MHz FSK transceiver for wireless body sensor network (BSN) applications is implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS technology with 0.7 V supply. A transceiver architecture based on injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) is proposed for the low energy consumption. In the receiver, the ILFD in the signal path converts the received FSK signal to amplitude-modulated signal which is applied to the next envelope detector. In the transmitter, the ILFD is used as digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) which directly modulates the FSK signal with digital data. The DCO replaces the frequency synthesizer to eliminate the crystal oscillator (XO), which leads to reduce power consumption and cost. The transceiver can detect whether injection locking occurs or not, and calibrates the frequency drift of DCO over temperature variation thanks to ILFD based architecture. The receiver and transmitter consume 420 μW and 700 μW , respectively, at - 10 dBm output power with a data rate of 5 Mb/s, corresponding to energy consumption of 84 pJ per received bit and 140 pJ per transmitted bit.},

abstract={We present an ultra-low voltage, highly linear, low noise integrated CMOS receiver operating from a 0.6-V supply. The receiver incorporates programmable, in-band feed-forward interferer cancellation at the baseband to obtain high linearity and low noise operation at ultra-low supply voltages. Being able to reject adjacent channel or far-out blockers, the digitally calibrated interferer cancellation improves the IIP3 and IIP2 by more than 13 dB and 8 dB respectively with very little impact on the receiver noise figure. As such, it breaks the trade-off between linearity and noise figure, making it possible to use a high-gain RF front-end to achieve low noise figure without affecting the linearity of the ultra-low voltage baseband circuits. The 0.6-V 900-MHz direct-conversion receiver prototype integrates a differential LNA, RF transconductors, linear quadrature current driven passive mixers, feed-forward interferer cancellation circuits, baseband variable gain transimpedance amplifiers and second-order channel-select filters. It has a nominal conversion gain of 56.4 dB, noise figure of 5 dB, IIP3 of -9.8 dBm and IIP2 of 21.4 dBm. The receiver operates reliably from 0.55-0.65 V, consumes 26.4 mW and occupies an active area of 1.7 mm2 in a 65-nm low-power CMOS process, of which the feed-forward interferer cancellation circuits consume 11.4 mW and occupies 0.43 mm2 .},

abstract={A 65 nm self-synchronous field programmable gate array (SSFPGA) with delay insensitive operation and pipeline granularity at the gate level, is shown to be robust to process voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. The proposed SSFPGA employs a 38 × 38 array of four-input, three-stage self-synchronous configurable logic blocks, with the introduction of a new dual tree-divider four-input, three-pipeline stage LUT to achieve a 2.97 GHz throughput at 1.2 V. Correct operation is measured with 500 mVp-p, 1.12 GHz externally introduced power supply noise at 1.2 V power supply, equivalent to 42% power supply bounce. Sensitivity against power supply noise frequency has been measured, and confirmed with simulation results to show a strong correlation with the average operating frequency. Correct operation was shown over 10 chips with 16% performance variation, with VDD change from 728 mV to 2 V, and temperature change from 0°C to 120°C, without tuning any input parameters such as clock frequency, supply voltages and biases. Results show the SSFPGA can adapt and is inherently robust to these variations with internal throughput measured from 300 MHz to 4.07 GHz, while maintaining correct operation. The operation under noisey power supply conditions is compared to a conventional synchronous FPGA, which show the SSFPGA has 4.2 times error free operation. The failure mode is also measured on the SSFPGA using an accelerated stress cycle between 0°C and 120°C at 2 V, showing the SSFPGA has 8% longer correct operation before chip malfunction past a 10% delay margin commonly used in synchronous systems.},

title={A Fast Phase Tracking ADPLL for Video Pixel Clock Generation in 65 nm CMOS Technology}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2300-2311}, 
abstract={A phase-locked loop (PLL) for analog video RGB signal acquisition interface requires precise clock generation from a very noisy and low-frequency horizontal synchronization signal (HSYNC). In such applications, the frequency multiplication ratio is always larger than 800 and can be up to over 2600. The output pixel clock has to be phase aligned to the HSYNC. Otherwise, the displayed image will become blurry. A fast phase tracking all-digital PLL (ADPLL) for video pixel clock generation in a 65 nm CMOS technology is presented in this paper. In the proposed ADPLL, the digital loop filter eliminates the reference clock jitter effects and then the period jitter of the output pixel clock can be reduced. A time-to-digital converter (TDC) and a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) are used to perform the fast phase tracking, and the tracking jitter is controlled at less than one-third of the output pixel clock period. As compared to prior studies, the proposed ADPLL does not require an extra external oscillator to overcome the reference clock jitter effects. Thus, it has a small chip area and low power consumption, and is well-suited to video pixel clock generation applications in 65 nm CMOS process.},

abstract={A low power, high PSRR, clock-free, current-controlled class-D audio power amplifier is presented. The proposed audio amplifier utilizes integral sliding mode control (ISMC) to ensure robust operation and to minimize the steady-state error. This architecture has two feedback loops: an outer voltage loop that minimizes the voltage error between the input and output audio signals, and an inner current loop that measures the inductor current to track the input signal accurately. The proposed amplifier achieves up to 82 dB of power supply rejection ratio (PSRR), more than 90 dB of signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over the entire audio band, and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) as low as 0.02%. A power-supply-induced intermodulation distortion (PS-IMD) of approximately - 90 dBc was measured for an input voltage signal of 2 Vpp at 1 kHz and a sinusoidal power-supply ripple of 300 mVpp at 217 Hz superimposed on the DC level. The IC prototype's controller consumes 30% less power than those of recently published works. The audio amplifier operates with a 2.7-V single voltage supply and delivers a maximum output power of 410 mW with 84% peak efficiency (η) into an 8 Ω speaker. It was fabricated using 0.5 μm CMOS standard technology, and occupies a total active area of 1.65 mm2.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1433-1442}, 
abstract={One of the key factors underlying the popularity of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is its iterative decoding algorithm which is amenable to efficient analog and digital implementation. However, different applications of LDPC codes (e.g. wireless sensor networks) impose different sets of constraints which include speed, bit error rates (BER) and energy efficiency. Our previous work reported an algorithmic framework for designing margin propagation (MP) based LDPC decoders where the BER performance can be traded off with its energy efficiency. In this paper we present an analog current-mode implementation of an MP-based (32,8) LDPC decoder. The implementation uses only addition, subtraction and threshold operations and hence is independent of transistor biasing. Measured results from prototypes fabricated in a 0.5 μm CMOS process verify the functionality of a (32,8) LDPC decoder and demonstrate the trade-off capability which is realized by adapting a system hyper-parameter. When configured as a min-sum LDPC decoder, the proposed implementation demonstrates superior BER performance compared to the state-of-the-art analog min-sum decoder at SNR greater than 3.5 dB. We show that an optimal configuration of the same MP-based decoder can also deliver up to 3 dB improvement in BER compared to the benchmark min-sum LDPC decoder.},

abstract={This paper presents a 12-GS/s 5-bit time-interleaved flash ADC realized in 65-nm CMOS. To improve the dynamic performance at high input frequencies, a statistics-based background calibration scheme for timing skew is employed. The timing skew is detected in the digital domain through a correlation-based algorithm and minimized by adjusting digitally controlled delay lines. In order to minimize power consumption, we employ near minimum size comparators, whose offset is reduced through foreground calibrated trim-DAC circuitry. With the timing calibration activated, the skew-related impairments are reduced by 12 dB at high input frequencies, resulting in an SNDR of 25.1 dB near Nyquist. The prototype IC consumes 81 mW from a 1.1 V supply, yielding a figure-of-merit of 0.35 pJ/conversion-step at low input frequencies, and 0.46 pJ/conversion-step for inputs near Nyquist.},

This paper introduces an adaptive, dynamic SRAM word-line under-drive (ADWLUD) scheme that uses a bitcell-based sensor to dynamically optimize the strength of WLUD for each die. The ADWLUD sensor enables 130 mV reduction in SRAM Vccmin while increasing frequency yield by 9% over conventional SRAM without WLUD. The sensor area overhead is limited to 0.02% and power overhead is 2% for a 3.4 Mb SRAM array.},

abstract={This paper describes a 1 Gbit GDDR5 SDRAM with enhanced bank access flexibility for efficient data transfer in 7 Gb/s per pin IO bandwidth. The enhanced flexibility is achieved by elimination of bank group restriction and reduction of bank to bank active time to 2.5 ns.

To realize the enhanced bank access flexibility, this DRAM employs the following techniques: skewed control logic, PVT variation compensated IO sense amplifier with auto calibration by replica impedance monitor, FIFO based BLSA enable signal generator, low latency VPP generator and active jitter canceller.

abstract={This paper proposes a novel programmable vision chip based on multiple levels of parallel processors. The chip integrates CMOS image sensor, multiple-levels of SIMD parallel processors and an embedded microprocessor unit (MPU). The multiple-levels of SIMD parallel processors consist of an array processor of SIMD processing elements (PEs) and a column of SIMD row processors (RPs). The PE array and RPs have an O(N × N) parallelism and an O(N) parallelism, respectively. The PE array and RPs can be reconfigured to handle algorithms with different complexities and processing speeds. The PE array, RPs and MPU can execute low-, mid-and high-level image processing algorithms, respectively, which efficiently increases the performance of the vision chip. The vision chip can satisfy flexibly the needs of different vision applications such as image pre-processing, complicated feature extraction and over 1000 fps high-speed image capture. A prototype chip with 128 × 28 image sensor, 128 A/D converters, 32 8-bit RPs and 32 × 128 PEs is fabricated using the 0.18 μm CMOS process.

year={2011}, 
volume={46},

pages={2869-2881}, 
abstract={This paper presents a third order, single-loop, continuous-time ΔΣ modulator with an internal 4-bit quantizer. The modulator is sampled at 500 MHz, and features an oversampling ratio of only 10. Therefore, DAC linearization by dynamic element matching is ineffective, and the DAC nonlinearities are not corrected within the ΔΣ modulator loop but in the subsequent digital circuit. The unit element mismatches are digitally estimated based on a correlation, and correction factors are thus derived. Moreover, in order to achieve a low-power operation, all amplifiers are compensated for finite gain-bandwidth related non-idealities. In the presented work, this compensation includes the fast proportional loop, which is used to compensate for excess loop delay. The presented ΔΣ modulator has been realized in a 1.2 V, 90 nm CMOS process and achieves an SNDR of 63.5 dB and an SFDR of 81 dB within a 25 MHz bandwidth. The modulator occupies an active die area of only 0.15 mm2 and has a power consumption of 8 mW, with an additional 0.02 mm2 and 0.42 mW estimated for the digital DAC correction logic. The overall modulator achieves a figure of merit of 138 fJ/conv.},

abstract={State-of-the-art passive RFID tags are limited in terms of functionality and operating range due to the limited power that can be converted from the electromagnetic field. This is why state-of-the-art wireless sensor systems are mostly battery-based if a high operating range is required. The proposed ultralow-power on-chip sensor unit and off-chip sensor interface which provides enough energy to supply various sensors with a power consumption up to the milliwatt range make it possible to remotely power the proposed RFID tag and use it as wireless sensor node. Equipping sensor nodes with RFID functionality not only enables identification and logistic applications but also an easy integration of the sensing tag into existing RFID systems. Exploiting the different characteristics of HF and UHF RFID systems, namely the large operating range in UHF and the high available power in HF, increases the flexibility and applicability of wireless sensor nodes. This paper presents a remotely powered multifrequency sensing tag according to the EPC HF and EPC Class 1 Gen 2 UHF standard developed in a 0.13-μm low-cost CMOS process. Input powers of -10.3 or -7.9 dBm at a frequency of 900 MHz are necessary to operate the sensing tag with activated on-chip sensor unit or off-chip sensor interface, respectively.},

abstract={Abstract-A technique for integrating a wireless switch into an M&M™ sized radio operating at 2.4 GHz that can turn a radio on or off is demonstrated using a 130-nm digital CMOS process. The switch circuit like a passive radio frequency identification system picks up an amplitude modulated 5.8-GHz carrier and converts it to DC to power up a portion of radio connected to a coin-cell battery. The radio uses a 2.4/5.8 GHz dual band antenna, and the wireless switch is added between the antenna, and transmit/receive (T/R) switch of the radio. By incorporating an input impedance transformation network, the wireless switch achieves input sensitivity of ~ -13 dBm. Inclusion of this circuit degrades the maximum transmitted power and sensitivity of 2.4-GHz transceiver by 0.3-0.5 dB. The RF clamp of wireless switch also limits the input power above ~ 12 dBm to protect the switch and transceiver. The wireless switch occupies an area of ~ 400 X 590 μm2.},

abstract={SRAM has been under its renovation stage recently, aiming to withstand the ever-increasing process variation as well as to support ultra-low-power applications using even subthreshold supply voltages. We present in this paper a novel P-P-N-based 10T SRAM cell, in which the latch is formed essentially by a cross-coupled P-P-N inverter pair. This type of cell can operate at a voltage as low as 285 mV while still demonstrating high resilience to process variation. Its noise margin has been elevated in not only the hold state, but also the read operations. As compared to previous 10T SRAM cells, our cell excels in particular in two aspects: 1) ultra-low cell leakage, and 2) high immunity to the data-dependent bitline leakage. The second merit makes it especially suitable for an SRAM macro with long bitlines - a property often desirable in order to achieve high density. We have fabricated and validated its performance through a 16 Kb SRAM test chip using the UMC 90 nm process technology.},

pages={1810-1819}, 
abstract={An interpolative-phase-tuning (IPT) technique is proposed to tune the frequency of millimeter-wave (MMW) LC-based ring oscillators without using varactor. As a key feature, the tradeoff between tank Q and tuning range of the proposed IPT oscillators is independent of the operation frequency, which makes the IPT technique suitable for applications at MMW frequencies. Moreover, the IPT oscillators can achieve larger frequency tuning range and much better phase accuracy over the tuning range as compared to the conventional gm-coupled LC oscillators for multiphase generation. Two IPT oscillator prototypes are designed and implemented in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. The first one operates at 50 GHz with eight output phases and measures phase noise of -103.7 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset and -127.8 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset, tuning range of 6.8%, and figure of merit (FOM) of 186.4 dB while occupying chip area of 0.36 mm2. The second prototype oscillates at 60 GHz with four output phases and measures phase noise of -95.5 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset, -120.6 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset, tuning range of 9%, and FOM of 180.6 dB with chip area of 0.2 mm2.},

abstract={A fully-integrated 16-element 60-GHz phased-array receiver is implemented in IBM 0.12-μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The receiver employs RF-path phase-shifting and is designed for multi-Gb/s non-line of sight links in the 60-GHz ISM band (IEEE 802.15.3c and 802.11ad). Each RF front-end includes variable-gain LNAs and phase shifters with each front-end capable of 360° variable phase shift (11.25° phase resolution) from 57 GHz to 66 GHz with coarse/fine gain steps. A detailed analysis of the noise trade-offs in the receiver array design is presented to motivate architectural choices. The hybrid active and passive signal-combining network in the receiver uses a differential cross-coupled Gysel power combiner that reduces combiner loss and area. Each array front-end has 6.8-dB noise figure (at 22°C ) and the array has -10 dB to 58 dB programmable gain from single-input to output. Sixteen 60-GHz aperture-coupled patch-antennas and the RX IC are packaged together in multi-layer organic and LTCC packages. The packaged RX IC is capable of operating in all four IEEE 802.15.3c channels (58.32 to 64.8 GHz). Beam-forming and beam-steering measurements show good performance with 50-ns beam switching time. 5.3-Gb/s OFDM 16-QAM and 4.5 Gb/s SC 16-QAM links are demonstrated using the packaged RX ICs.

Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS the RFE measures 4-dB noise figure, 17-to-35-dB gain range, and +32/-3.4-dBm IIP2/IIP3 with no tuning.

abstract={This paper presents a V-band low-noise active balun with broadband phase-correction technique (PCT). The proposed technique effectively mitigates the phase deviation of active balun caused by parasitic imbalance and circuit mismatch. This technique is insensitive to frequency, which makes the operation frequency of active balun with the PCT can be extended to millimeter-wave (MMW) band. Within the low noise current-reuse pre-amplifier, this active balun circuit can be employed as low-noise amplifier as well. The measured phase error keeps less than 10 degrees from 50 GHz to 67 GHz, which demonstrates the robust calibration of phase error at MMW frequency. The measured voltage gain and noise figure at 63 GHz are 17.6 dB and 8.6 dB, respectively. The core power consumption is 19 mW from 1.4 V supply voltage with a core area of 0.275 mm2.},

The proposed approach significantly simplifies the ADPLL architecture while maintaining excellent phase noise. The PLL is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. The 32-phase embedded phase-to-digital converter (PDC) achieves 2π/64 phase resolution. The measured in-band phase noise is -108 dBc/Hz at 4 GHz with a 78 MHz reference and a 1 MHz loop bandwidth.},

abstract={The linearity of conventional active-RC filters is limited by the operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) used in the integrators. Transconductance-capacitance (Gm-C) filters are fast and can be linear- however, they are sensitive to parasitic capacitances. We explore the Gm-assisted OTA-RC technique, which is a way of combining Gm-C and active-RC integrators in a manner that enhances the linearity and speed of the latter, while adding negligible extra noise or power dissipation. Measurements from a fifth-order Chebyshev filter with 20 MHz bandwidth, designed in a 0.18 μ m CMOS process, demonstrate the efficacy of Gm-assistance in an active-RC integrator.},

pages={828-837}, 
abstract={Aiming to resolve memory bottlenecks in multi-core system, novel 1-Tbyte/s 1-Gbit DRAM architecture based on a multi-core configuration and 3-D interconnects was developed. The DRAM stacked on a multi-core CPU has 512-bit I/Os with through-silicon-via (TSV) distributed in 16 memory cores. Five-stage pipelined architecture in the compact DRAM core was developed to reduce the operation cycle of the data-bus to 2 ns. A low-noise early-bar-write scheme for an 8-ns cycle array operation and 16-Gbit/s I/O circuits on TSV were also developed. The proposed DRAM architecture greatly improves power efficiency. TSV scheme reduces the parasitic capacitance of the interconnects between the DRAM and CPU, and multi-core architecture reduces the length of the data bus on the DRAM. A 1-Gbit DRAM was designed based on the 45-nm stand-alone DRAM process. Chip size is 51.6 mm2 assuming 4F2 memory cells, and the density is about 5 times higher than that of embedded DRAM. Circuit simulations confirmed the 2-ns operation of the data bus, 8-ns operation of the memory array, and 16-Gbit/s operation of I/O circuits. Power consumption is 19.5 W, providing power efficiency of 51.3 Gbyte/s/W, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of conventional DRAMs.},

abstract={Razor is a hybrid technique for dynamic detection and correction of timing errors. A combination of error detecting circuits and micro-architectural recovery mechanisms creates a system that is robust in the face of timing errors, and can be tuned to an efficient operating point by dynamically eliminating unused timing margins. Savings from margin reclamation can be realized as per device power-efficiency improvement, or parametric yield improvement for a batch of devices. In this paper, we apply Razor to a 32 bit ARM processor with a micro-architecture design that has balanced pipeline stages with critical memory access and clock-gating enable paths. The design is fabricated on a UMC 65 nm process, using industry standard EDA tools, with a worst-case STA signoff of 724 MHz. Based on measurements on 87 samples from split-lots, we obtain 52% power reduction for the overall distribution at 1 GHz operation. We present error rate driven dynamic voltage and frequency scaling schemes where runtime adaptation to PVT variations and tolerance of fast transients is demonstrated. All Razor cells are augmented with a sticky error history bit, allowing precise diagnosis of timing errors over the execution of test vectors. We show potential for parametric yield improvement through energy-efficient operation using Razor.},

abstract={The proposed single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converter with interleaving energy-conservation mode (IECM) control is designed using 65 nm technology to power the ultra-wide band (UWB) system. The energy-conservation mode (ECM) control generates four different energy delivery paths for dual buck outputs with only one inductor. In addition, the superposition technique is used to achieve a minimized inductor current level. The average inductor current is equal to the summation of two output loads. Moreover, the IECM control activates the interleaving operation through the current interleaving mechanism to provide large driving capability as well as to reduce the output voltage ripple. As a result, 91% peak efficiency is derived and the output voltage ripple appears notably minimized by 50% using current interleaving at heavy load. The test chip occupies 1.44 mm2 in 65 nm CMOS and integrates with a three-dimensional (3-D) architecture for inductor integration.},

abstract={A single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) step-down DC-DC converter with continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation is proposed to achieve an area-efficient power management module. The low-voltage energy distribution controller (LV-EDC) can simultaneously guarantee good voltage regulation and low output voltage ripple. With the proposed dual-mode energy delivery methodology, cross regulation in steady-state output voltage ripple, which is rarely discussed, and cross regulation in load transient response are both effectively reduced. In addition, the energy mode transition operation helps obtain the appropriate energy operation mode using the energy delivery paths for dual outputs. Moreover, within the allowable output voltage ripple, the automatic energy bypass (AEB) mechanism can reduce the number of energy delivery paths, thereby ensuring voltage regulation and further enhancing efficiency. The test chip, fabricated in 55-nm CMOS, occupies 1.44 mm2 and achieves 91% peak efficiency, low output voltage ripple, and excellent load transient response for a high-efficiency system-on-a-chip (SoC) integration.},

A test device was fabricated in TSMC's 40 nm LP CMOS process and performance measurements indicate substantial margin improvements, even when the matched source-synchronous system is subjected to realistic source SJ and independent PSIJ noise. Comparable performance was also achieved with embedded common-mode clocking with matched peak swings, indicating it as a potential solution for pin-constrained designs.},

pages={293-307}, 
abstract={In this paper key design issues and considerations of a low-cost 3-D Cu-TSV technology are investigated. The impact of TSV on BEOL interconnect reliability is limited, no failures have been observed. The impact of TSV stress on MOS devices causes shifts, further analysis is required to understand their importance. Thermal hot spots in 3-D chip stacks cause temperature increases three times higher than in 2-D chips, necessitating a careful thermal floorplanning to avoid thermal failures. We have monitored for ESD during 3-D processing and have found no events take place, however careful further monitoring is required. The noise coupling between two tiers in a 3-D chip-stack is 20 dB lower than in a 2-D SoC, opening opportunities for increased mixed signal system performance. The impact on digital circuit performance of TSVs is accurately modeled with the presented RC model and digital gates can directly drive signals through TSVs at high speed and low power. Experimental results of a 3-D Network-on-Chip implementation demonstrate that the NoC concept can be extended from 2-D SoC to 3-D SoCs at low area (0.018 ) and power (3%) overhead.},

The VCO introduces a negative resistance structure in conjunction with capacitive cross-coupling. This compound structure allows fundamental oscillation to be sustained at high frequencies while providing wide tuning ranges. The capabilities of the capacitive feedback were analyzed using a linear transistor model, and boundary conditions, which support the early design phase, were derived. The chip was fabricated in a SiGe technology with 300-GHz fmax HBTs. The output frequency of the monolithic microwave integrated circuit is centered at 122 GHz and provides a tuning range of 16 GHz at an average single-sideband phase noise of -95 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency. Possible applications include ISM applications at 122 GHz and short-range radar systems with wide tuning ranges.},

abstract={Process variations in advanced CMOS nodes limit the benefits of scaling for analog designs. In the presence of increasing random intra-die variations, mismatch becomes a significant design challenge for circuits such as comparators. In this paper we describe and demonstrate the details of a statistical element selection (SES) methodology that relies on the combinatorial growth of subsets of selectable circuit elements (e.g., input transistors in a comparator) to provide redundancy for post-manufacturing calibration of specifications (e.g., offset). A test chip consisting of an array of digitally calibrated comparators with built-in combinatorial redundancy was manufactured in 65 nm bulk CMOS. Over 99.5% of the comparators satisfy the given offset specification compared to 15% for Pelgrom-type sizing. A second test chip in the same process consists of an 8-bit, 1.5 GS/s flash ADC and achieves 37 db SNDR at low frequencies. The total power is 35 mW, 20 mW in the S&H and 15 mW in the ADC core.

year={2011},

abstract={This work presents an area- and power-efficient realization of a new time-encoding oversampling converter (TEOC) consisting of a third-order continuous time (CT) loop filter and a self-oscillating pulse-width modulator (PWM). The modulator displays similar performance to that of a standard multibit CT-ΣΔ modulator but has the complexity of a single bit design. The time-encoding quantizer (TEQ) is implemented inside a ΣΔ modulator by replacing a multibit quantizer. An innovative TEQ is used to overcome design issues in a 1.0 V supply-voltage 65 nm digital CMOS technology. The TEQ allows an exchange of amplitude-resolution by time-resolution. The approach of time-resolution alleviates the scaling difficulties of mixed-signal circuits in nano-scale technologies. The TEOC features a 63 dB dynamic-range and a peak-SNDR of 61 dB over a 20 MHz signal bandwidth. Clocked at 2.5 GHz, the complete ADC consumes 7 mW from a single 1.0 V supply, including also the reference buffers. The ADC core results in an attractively small area of 0.08 mm2 and in a figure-of-merit (FoM=Pwr/2 · BW · 2ENOB) of 0.17 pJ/conversion-step.},

This modulator employs operational amplifiers with PST to optimize power consumption among the tri-mode operation. In addition, the modulator incorporates the proposed QMS to mitigate the mismatch between the I/Q multi-bit DACs. Fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the proposed QBP-CTDSM achieves 81/61.2/60.9 dB SNDR across 270- kHz/5-MHz/8-MHz bandwidth. The bandpass center frequency is programmable from 500 kHz to 12 MHz. Measured from a 1.8-V supply voltage, the modulator power consumptions are 4.9/8.9/12.1 mW for the GSM-EDGE/UMTS/DVB-T modes, respectively, which result in FOMs of 0.99/0.95/0.84 pJ/conversion.

year={2011}, 
volume={46},

pages={259-275}, 
abstract={The biomimetic CMOS dynamic vision and image sensor described in this paper is based on a QVGA (304×240) array of fully autonomous pixels containing event-based change detection and pulse-width-modulation (PWM) imaging circuitry. Exposure measurements are initiated and carried out locally by the individual pixel that has detected a change of brightness in its field-of-view. Pixels do not rely on external timing signals and independently and asynchronously request access to an (asynchronous arbitrated) output channel when they have new grayscale values to communicate. Pixels that are not stimulated visually do not produce output. The visual information acquired from the scene, temporal contrast and grayscale data, are communicated in the form of asynchronous address-events (AER), with the grayscale values being encoded in inter-event intervals. The pixel-autonomous and massively parallel operation ideally results in lossless video compression through complete temporal redundancy suppression at the pixel level. Compression factors depend on scene activity and peak at ~1000 for static scenes. Due to the time-based encoding of the illumination information, very high dynamic range - intra-scene DR of 143 dB static and 125 dB at 30 fps equivalent temporal resolution - is achieved. A novel time-domain correlated double sampling (TCDS) method yields array FPN of <;0.25% rms. SNR is >56 dB (9.3 bit) for >10 Lx illuminance.},

abstract={State-of-the-art wireless sensor nodes are mostly supplied by batteries. Such systems have the disadvantage that they are not maintenance free because of the limited lifetime of batteries. Instead, wireless sensor nodes or related devices can be remotely powered. To increase the operating range and applicability of these remotely powered devices an electro-magnetic energy harvester iPs developed in a 0.13 μ m low cost CMOS technology. This paper presents an energy harvesting system that converts RF power to DC power to supply wireless sensor nodes, active transmitters or related systems with a power consumption up to the mW range. This energy harvesting system is used to power a wireless sensor node from the 900 MHz RF field. The wireless sensor node includes an on-chip temperature sensor and a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) based transmitter. The BAW resonator reduces the startup time of the transmitter to about 2 μs which reduces the amount of energy needed in one transmission cycle. The maximum output power of the transmitter is 5.4 dBm. The chip contains an ultra-low-power control unit and consumes only 190 nW in idle mode. The required input power is -19.7 dBm.},

abstract={This paper presents an 8-18 GHz wideband receiver with recursive super-heterodyne topology. A multi-feedback technology is utilized in the LNA design for the input matching over the wide frequency range in X- and Ku-band. In order to save power, both the RF and IF signals share a tunable transconductance stage. The IF output of the first mixer is fed back into the tunable input stage for IF amplification in a recursive manner, which significantly enhances the gain tuning without increasing the power. The wideband receiver MMIC is implemented in a 0.13 SiGe BiCMOS technology and achieves a 6.7-7.8 dB noise figure. The receiver average gain over the frequency range is measured as 53 dB maximum gain with 20 dB continual tuning and 36 dB discrete tuning. The average output P1dB over the frequency range is measured as 10 dBm at maximum gain. The receiver dissipates only 180 mW with a 2.2 V power supply.},

The chip converts both capacitance and temperature to frequency using a time-interleaved relaxation oscillator, which modulates RF backscatter to a reader for computation of measured samples. A significant reduction in power consumption results from the elimination of the digitization circuitry, time-multiplexed operation, and moving the signal processing burden to the external reader using analog IF-modulated backscatter. The chip exhibits measured capacitance and temperature standard deviations of 1.4 fF and 0.4°C, respectively.},

abstract={Conventional 6-transistor (6T) SRAM scaling to newer technologies and lower supply voltages is difficult due to a complex trade-off space involving stability, performance, power, and area. Local and global variation make SRAM design even more challenging. We present a 5-transistor (5T) bitcell that uses sizing asymmetry to improve read stability and to provide an efficient knob for trading off the aforementioned metrics. In this paper, we compare the 5T with the conventional 6T and the 8T and show how it can be a flexible, intermediate alternative between the two. We also investigate single-ended sensing for the 5T. Finally, we present measurement results in a 45 nm test chip that demonstrate the functionality of the 5T. Through a combination of write assists, the 5T can demonstrate comparable writability down to 0.7 V, while showing no read errors down to 0.5 V.},

abstract={An on-chip waveform capturer exhibits 8.8-bit effective accuracy at a 5-ps timing resolution and 190 μ V voltage, with an effective bandwidth of 700 MHz in a 65-nm CMOS prototype. Voltage by a digital-to-analog converter with selectable slopes and offsets is linearly translated into timing, that is used for strobing a waveform. Programmable timing and voltage generation as well as selective input channels are intended for exhaustive power noise measurements on power delivery networks (PDNs) across rail-to-rail voltage domains in a chip. The measurement procedures are totally governed by an embedded controller. The waveform capturer, in combination with a PDN exciter, realizes in situ derivation of resonance parameters by assembling oscillatory waveforms. A power noise reduction of more than 50% is accomplished through on-chip PDN diagnosis, in which the operation frequencies are selected such that the periodical appearance of PDN resonance is prevented.},

abstract={This paper reports a digital phase locked loop (D-PLL) based frequency locking technique for high frequency hysteretic controlled dc-dc buck converters. The proposed converter achieves constant operating frequency over a wide output voltage range, eliminating the dependence of switching frequency on duty cycle or voltage conversion range. The D-PLL is programmable over a wide range of parameters and can be synchronized to a clock reference to ensure proper frequency lock and switching operation outside undesirable power supply resonance bands. The stability and loop dynamics of the proposed converter is analyzed using an analog equivalent PLL behavioral model which describes the dc-dc converter as a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). We demonstrate a 90-240 MHz single phase converter with fast hysteretic control and output conversion range of 33%-80%.

abstract={This paper presents a Wireless-USB/WiMedia-compliant fast-hopping frequency synthesizer architecture with quadrature outputs based on sub-harmonic injection-locking. The synthesizer features a cross-coupled quadrature digitally-controlled oscillator, that is injection-locked to a sub-harmonic frequency. An intuitive closed-form expression for the dynamics of the quadrature injection-locked oscillator and a technique to achieve fast frequency-hopping, are presented. The overall architecture, based on this technique, is a CMOS-only implementation and has been fabricated in a 0.13-μm SiGe BiCMOS process. On-chip mixers have been implemented to measure the quadrature accuracy of the outputs. Measurement results indicate lock-times of less than 2.5 ns, a locked phase noise of -114 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset and a quadrature accuracy of better than 0.5°. The frequency synthesizer (excluding output buffers) occupies an area of 0.27 mm2 and consumes 14.5 mW of power. The best and worst case spur suppression achieved are 47 and 31 dB, respectively.

According to the proposed methodology, a 915-MHz harvester comprising an integrated input matching network and a 17-stage self-compensated rectifier has been designed and fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS technology. The rectifier exhibits a remarkably low input power threshold, as it is able to deliver a 1-V dc output voltage to a capacitive load with a very small input power of -24 dBm (4 μW). When driving a 1-MΩ load, the device can supply a 1.2-V output with an input power of -18.8 dBm (13.1 μW).

abstract={Efficiency degradation effects of power combining transformers with partially disabled inputs are quantitatively analyzed. To improve efficiencies in lower-power modes of a multi-mode class-AB power amplifier (PA), a discrete resizing technique is introduced in combination with a parallel-combining transformer (PCT). The two-stage PA implemented in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology also includes varactor-based tunable matching circuits. The design method involves parallel-combining of two power stages, each of which are divided into three sub-cells to facilitate discrete resizing. The parallel-combining of concurrently resized power cells minimizes undesired power loss through the transformer and helps the PA to utilize the transformer efficiency maximally independent of the number of combining cells. When operating in the high-power mode, the PA exhibits a peak output power of 31 dBm with a PAE of 34.8%. Power back-offs are realized by discretely turning off parallel sub-amplifier cells concurrently, achieving output power levels of 26 dBm and 22.3 dBm with respective PAE of 22.5% and 15%. The EVM has been measured with IEEE 802.11g WLAN and 802.16e WiMAX modulated signals in three operation modes. In the high-power mode, the PA dissipates 590 mA from a 3.3 V supply.},

abstract={This paper describes a new analog-to-digital converter based on the traditional dual-slope ADC operation. With a small modification to the discharging phase of the dual-slope ADC, first-order quantization noise shaping is achieved. This quantizer is used in a second-order loop filter and results in an overall third-order quantization noise shaping. To remove the need for any extra active element, this quantizer is merged with the active adder. In this fashion, the multi-bit flash ADC is removed and hence the loading of the active-adder is reduced to a single continuous-time comparator. Furthermore, to alleviate the speed of the counting-clock and the common-mode biasing accuracy requirements, a bi-directional discharging scheme is proposed. As a proof of concept, the second-order loop filter with the proposed quantizer is fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology and achieves over 78 dB SNDR with an oversampling ratio of 24 and 50 MHz sampling speed. The power consumption is 2.9 mW from a 1.5 V power supply.},

abstract={High-rate communications technology leveraging the unlicensed spectrum around 60 GHz is almost ready for deployment with several demonstrations of successful wireless links. One key aspect of the transceiver is the ability to handle analog fractional bandwidths in the order of 20%, challenging for both the linear processing chain and the frequency reference generator. In classical LC loaded stages bandwidth trades with gain making them unsuitable for wide band amplifiers at millimeter-waves where the available device gain is relatively low. In this work, we exploit inter-stage coupling realizing higher order filters where wider bandwidth is achieved at the expense of in-band gain ripple only. The receiver adopts a sliding IF architecture employing an integer-N type-II synthesizer, with a three state phase frequency detector charge pump combination, a switched tuned LC VCO followed by a low power wide range divider chain. By judicious choice of charge pump current and filter components integrated phase noise, critical for signal constellation integrity at high rate, is kept low. This paper inspects the inter-stage coupling technique, providing design formulas, and discusses the design of each receiver block. Experiments performed on 65 nm prototypes provide: 6.5 dB maximum noise figure over >;13 GHz bandwidth, -22.5 dBc integrated phase noise while consuming 84 mW.},

abstract={A third-order self-oscillating class D audio amplifier that utilizes a hysteretic comparator is presented. The design is analyzed and its THD is theoretically determined by employing an equivalent model, that relates the approach to natural sampling pulse-width modulation. The architecture eliminates the requirement for a high-quality carrier generator. A low-cost hysteresis compensation technique is utilized to enhance distortion performance at high output power levels. An implementation is presented in a 0.7 μm CMOS process. It achieves a dynamic range (DR) of 116.5 dB, and a THD+N of 0.0012%, while delivering a power of 125 mW into an 8 Ω load at 1 kHz. The THD+N is under 0.006% up to 90% of the maximum output power. The amplifier can deliver 1.45 W into the load with a THD of 5% with a 5 V power supply. The efficiency is greater than 84% for output power larger than 1 W . The area of the amplifier is 6 mm2 .},

abstract={The use of light-activated modulation techniques, such as optogenetics, is growing in popularity for enabling basic neuroscience research. It is also being explored for advancing more applied applications like therapeutic neuromodulation. However, current hardware systems are generally limited to acute measurements or require external tethering of the system to the light source. This paper presents an implantable prototype for use in techniques that modulate neurological state through optically-activated channels and compounds. The prototype system employs a three chip custom IC architecture to manage information flow into the neural substrate, while also handling power dissipation and providing a chronic barrier to the tissue interface. In addition to covering the details of the IC architecture, we discuss system level design constraints and solutions, and in-vitro test results using our prototype system with an optogenetic model. Potential technical limitations for the broader adoption of these techniques will also be considered.},

abstract={In this paper we present an adaptive program-voltage generator for 3D-integrated solid state drives (SSDs) based on a boost converter. The converter consists of a spiral inductor, a high-voltage MOS circuit, and an adaptive-frequency and duty-cycle (AFD) controller. The spiral inductor requires an area of only 5 × 5 mm2 in an interposer. The high-voltage MOS circuit employs a mature NAND flash process. The AFD controller, implemented in a conventional low-voltage MOS process, dynamically optimizes clock frequencies and duty cycles at different values of output voltage, VOUT. The power consumption, rising time, and circuit area of the program-voltage generator are 88%, 73%, and 85% less than those of a program-voltage generator with a conventional charge pump, respectively. The total power consumption of each NAND flash memory is reduced by 68%. We also present the design methodology of the high-voltage MOS circuit of the boost converter with a conventional NAND flash process, in which charge-pump-based program-voltage generators are implemented.},

abstract={A quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE receiver, implemented in 65 nm CMOS, complies with the ETSI standard without the need of external SAW filters. By exploring the properties of passive mixers and current-mode operation from RF to baseband, the receiver can achieve a SAW-filter-like selectivity with inexpensive on-chip components such as resistors and capacitors. In addition, to alleviate the linearity bottleneck at the LNA input stage, Class-AB self-bias LNTA is employed to break the conventional trade-off's among NF, linearity and power consumption. For single-to-differential conversion, external LC-CL baluns (instead of on-chip baluns) are used to balance the on-chip die and external BOM cost. This receiver solution is embedded as a part of a cellular phone SoC and achieves <; - HOdBm sensitivity, >; +1 dBm Out-of-Band Pι dB and consumes 58.9 mA.

Transmitter pre-emphasis equalization is utilized to mitigate the effect of multipath on bit-error rate (BER).

abstract={A low phase noise, wideband, mm-wave, integer-N PLL that is capable of supporting an 802.15.3c heterodyne transceiver is reported. The PLL can generate 6 equally spaced tones from 43.2 GHz to 51.84 GHz, which is suitable for a heterodyne architecture with FLO=(4/5)×FTRX. Phase noise is measured directly at the FLO frequency and is better than -97.5 dBc/Hz@1 MHz across the entire band. The reported frequency synthesizer is smaller, exhibits less phase noise, and consumes less power than prior art. In addition, the FLO tone corresponds to the fundamental of the VCO as opposed to a higher harmonic.},

abstract={In this paper, an 11.3 Gbps CMOS SONET compliant transceiver designed to work in both RZ and NRZ data formats is presented. Using a configurable high-speed transmit path utilizing an AND gate and a duty cycle adjustment circuit, the transmitter can switch output format between RZ and NRZ. The TX driver exhibits 17 ps rise/fall times, 0.25 psrms RJ, and 2 pspp DJ. In RZ mode, TX output duty cycle can be adjusted within 40-60% range. To improve input sensitivity in both RZ and NRZ reception, the receiver incorporates a limiting amplifier with a distributed threshold adjustment circuit. It achieves 5 mVpp-diff RX input sensitivity with 0.54 UI high-frequency jitter tolerance. An adaptation scheme based on nested linear search is implemented to control the distributed threshold adjustment circuit. While demonstrating the integration of RZ/NRZ functionality into a single-chip solution using 65 nm CMOS technology, the transceiver core occupies 1.36 mm2 and consumes 214 mW.},

Additionally, a 500-GHz amplifier MMIC was fabricated using a more advanced 20-nm mHEMT technology. To package the submillimeter-wave circuits, a set of waveguide-to-microstrip transitions has been fabricated on both 50-μm-thick quartz and GaAs substrates, covering the frequency range between 220 and 500 GHz. The E-plane probes were integrated in a four-stage 20-nm cascode amplifier circuit to realize a full H -band (220 to 325 GHz) S-MMIC amplifier module with monolithically integrated waveguide transitions.},

abstract={This paper presents circuit techniques to improve the efficiency of high-current LED drivers. An error-averaged, senseFET-based current sensing technique is used to regulate the LED current accurately. Because the proposed scheme eliminates the series current-regulation element present in all conventional LED drivers, it greatly improves efficiency and reduces cost. The converter operates in three different operating modes, namely buck, buck-boost, and boost modes, and achieves high efficiency over the entire Li-Ion battery range (3-5.5 V). Fabricated in 0.5-μm CMOS process, the prototype occupies an active area of 5 mm2. At 1.2-A LED current, the driver achieves an efficiency improvement of over 13% compared to current-regulation-element-based LED drivers. Measured LED current accuracy is better than 2.8% over the entire range of the battery and its standard deviation measured across seven devices is less than 1.6%. The peak efficiencies are 90.7% and 86% at 600-and 1200-mA currents, respectively.},

abstract={An all-digital DLL is designed to generate low jittery 40 phases in a continuous lock range of 110 MHz to 1.4 GHz. The DLL is driven by dual loops-one for phase lock and the other for offset calibration. The two loops are updated by a chopping PD which adaptively extracts valid information for each loop, one at a time. For the optimal 1-bit delay resolution in the entire lock range, a piecewise profiling of delay line is also proposed. The DLL, fabricated in a 0.13 CMOS, reveals the best linearity performance compared with previously reported works, showing a DNL of less than 0.3 LSB and a INL of less than 0.8 LSB in the entire lock range up to 1.4 GHz. With the piecewise-fitted delay line, the amount of peak-to-peak and rms jitters induced by DLL operation is controlled to be less than 0.825% and 0.2% of the clock period, respectively. Power consumption was 74.4 mW at the supply voltage of 1.2 V.},

abstract={A packet-switched 6 × 4 2-D mesh network providing 2 Tb/s of bisectional bandwidth with a per-hop latency of 4-cycles, forms the high performance communication fabric for a Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC) with 48 Pentium™ class IA-32 cores. The fabric operates on an independent power supply and frequency domain. The router micro-architecture achieves over 90% network utilization by effective use of a single-cycle Wrapped Wave-Front Allocator (WWFA) and virtual channel (VC) flow control. A router transit latency of 2 ns is achieved through early buffer write, route pre-computation and a single-cycle WWFA implementation. This 640 K transistor, 1.32 mm2 router operates at 2 GHz at 1.1 V while dissipating 550 mW. The 24-node mesh network with 1.28 Tb/s router and 16B, 5.4 mm wide links consumes only 5% of the chip area, 1.2% of the transistors and 10% of total chip power at 1.1 V in a 45 nm nine-metal CMOS process. The router energy efficiency scales from 1.3 Tb/s/W to 7.2 Tb/s/W over a dynamic voltage range from 0.7 V to 1.25 V.},

abstract={Optimization of SRAM yield using dynamic stability metrics has been evaluated in the past to ensure continued scaling of bitcell size and supply voltage in future technology nodes. Various dynamic stability metrics have been proposed but they have not been used in practical failure analysis and compared with conventional static margins. This work compares static and dynamic metrics to identify expected correlations. A dynamic stability characterization architecture using pulsed word-lines is implemented in 45 nm CMOS to identify sources of variability, and their impact on SRAM stability. Static read margins were observed to overestimate failures by 10-100 X while static write margins failed to predict outliers in critical writeability. Critical writeability was demonstrated to exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to process variations, random telegraph noise (RTN), and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), compared to static write margins.},

abstract={The wide unlicensed bandwidth of a 60 GHz channel presents an attractive opportunity for high data rate and low power personal area networks (PANs). The use of single-carrier modulation can yield energy-efficient transmitter and receiver implementation, but equalization of the long channel response in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions presents a significant challenge. A digital equalizer for 60 GHz channels has been designed for both line of sight (LOS) and NLOS channel conditions to meet the IEEE WPAN standard. Power consumption is minimized by using a parallelized distributed arithmetic (DA) architecture. A 2 mm × 2 mm test chip in 65nm CMOS implements a 6 tap feedforward and 32 tap feedback equalizer that can be configured to cancel the response of up to 72 symbols, and consumes 5.6 mW at 2 Gb/s throughput. The chip also includes a channel estimator based on a Golay correlator for setting the equalizer coefficients and estimating frequency and timing error.},

abstract={Self-oscillating ΣΔ modulators are a class of ΣΔ modulators that combines noise shaping with pulsewidth modulation (PWM). Moreover, in such a modulator, the PWM carrier is generated by a self-oscillation mode that is deliberately introduced. In our approach, this self-oscillation is accurately controlled by a digital delay in the feedback loop. The concept is elaborated for a second-order self-oscillating ΣΔ modulator with 5-MHz bandwidth. Here, the clock frequency equals 850 MHz, but the loop only has to process signals that are maximally at the self-oscillation frequency (at 106.25 MHz). An additional key element in this design is the use of a feedback FIRDAC which reduces the jitter sensitivity and further relaxes the slewing requirements of the first opamp in the loop. The prototype modulator is fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process and achieves a dynamic range of 66 dB. Due to the simplicity of the circuit, the modulator core area is only 0.025 mm2. The power consumption of the modulator is 6 mW.},

abstract={This paper presents a partially-parallel dual-path fully-overlapped QC-LDPC decoder for the WiMAX system. By adopting five techniques including symmetrical six-stage pipelining, block column and row interleaving, nonzero sub-matrix reordering, sum memory quad-partition and read-write bypass, the decoder continuously scans nonzero sub-matrices two by two in the block row-wise order without any memory access conflict. Two phases are fully overlapped with each other, and the check node updating phase always takes the latest sums from the previous variable node updating phase. The sum memory stores not only the posterior sums but also the prior messages, which saves 11,520 memory bits. It only takes 48-54 clock cycles for the decoder to finish one iteration. The read-write accesses to sum memories are reduced by 24.3%-48.8%. Fabricated in the SMIC 0.13 μ m CMOS process, the decoder occupies 4.84 mm 2 with core area of 3.03 mm2, attains 847-955 Mb/s at 214 MHz and 10 iterations, and consumes 342-397 mW at 1.2 V with power efficiency of 39-46 pJ per bit per iteration.},

abstract={Novel program and read schemes are presented to break barriers in scaling of NAND flash memory such as threshold voltage endurance from floating gate interference, and charge loss tolerance. To enhance threshold voltage endurance and charge loss tolerance, we introduced three schemes; MSB Re-PGM scheme, Moving Read scheme and Adaptive Code Selection scheme. Using the MSB Re-PGM scheme, threshold voltage distribution width is improved about 200 mV. The PGM throughput is enhanced from 1500 μs to 1250 μs. With the Moving Read scheme about half order of UBER is improved with 10 bit ECC. Also, Adaptive Code Selection scheme are used to decrease a current consumption. There is 5.5% current reduction. With these techniques, 32-Gb MLC NAND flash memory has been fabricated using a 32 nm CMOS process technology. Its program throughput reaches 13.0 MB/s at a multi-plane program operation with cache operation keeping a desirable threshold voltage distribution.},

abstract={This paper describes a high performance scalable massively parallel single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) processor and power/area efficient real-time image processing. The SIMD processor combines 4-bit processing elements (PEs) with SRAM on a small area and thus enables at the same time a high performance of 191 GOPS, a high power efficiency of 310 GOPS/W, and a high area efficiency of 31.6 GOPS/mm2 . The applied pipeline architecture is optimized to reduce the number of controller overhead cycles so that the SIMD parallel processing unit can be utilized during up to 99% of the operating time of typical application programs. The processor can be also optimized for low cost, low power, and high performance multimedia system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions. A combination of custom and automated implementation techniques enables scalability in the number of PEs. The processor has two operating modes, a normal frequency (NF) mode for higher power efficiency and a double frequency (DF) mode for higher performance. The combination of high area efficiency, high power efficiency, high performance, and the flexibility of the SIMD processor described in this paper expands the application of real-time image processing technology to a variety of electronic devices.},

A successive approximation register (SAR) algorithm and on-chip all-digital frequency-locked loop (FLL) calibrate the carrier and sub-carrier frequencies. All voltage and current references required by the transmitter are included on-chip. The 0.2 × 0.5 mm2 active area transmitter consumes 900 μW from a 1 V supply. Energy efficiency of the transmitter is 9 nJ/bit running continuously at 100 kbits/s.},

abstract={A 10-b, 100-MS/s pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) without dedicated front-end sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) converts from dc to the 12th Nyquist band with in situ, mostly digital background calibration for the clock skew in the 3.5-b front-end stage. The skew information is extracted from the first-stage residue output with two comparators sensing out-of-range errors; a gradient-descent algorithm is used to adaptively adjust the timing of the front-end sub-ADC to synchronize with that of the sample-and-hold (S/H) in the multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC). The prototype ADC, implemented in a 90-nm CMOS process, digitizes inputs up to 610 MHz without skew errors in experiments; in contrast, the same ADC fails at 130 MHz with calibration disabled (with the default sub-ADC sample point set at the midpoint of the delay range). The prototype with calibration circuits fully integrated on chip consumes 12.2 mW and occupies 0.26-mm2 silicon area, while the calibration circuits dissipate 0.9 mW and occupy 0.01 mm2. A 71-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and a 55-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) were measured with a 20-MHz sine-wave input, and a larger than 55-dB SFDR was measured in the 10th Nyquist band.},

abstract={This paper describes a micropower low-noise neural front-end circuit capable of recording epileptic fast ripples (FR). The front-end circuit consisting of a preamplifier followed by a 6th-order bandpass filter is designed for signal sensing in a future epileptic deep brain stimulator. A current-splitting technique is combined with an output-branch current scaling technique in a folded-cascode amplifier structure to improve the noise and power tradeoff in the preamplifier. In measurements, the preamplifier exhibits 39.4 dB DC gain, 0.36 Hz to 1.3 kHz of -3 dB bandwidth, and 3.07 μVrms total input-referred noise while consuming 2.4 μW from a 2.8 V power supply provided by an on-chip regulator circuit. A noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 3.09 is achieved with minimal power consumption and is one of the lowest published to date. The 6th-order follow-the-leader feedback elliptic bandpass filter passes FR signals and provides -110 dB/decade attenuation to out-of-band frequency components. In measurements, the entire front-end circuit achieves a mid-band gain of 38.5 dB, a bandwidth from 250 to 486 Hz, and a total input-referred noise of 2.48 μVrms while consuming 4.5 μW from the 2.8 V power supply. The front-end NEF achieved is 7.6. To the authors' knowledge, the proposed epileptic seizure- detection system is the first to achieve the FR-recording functionality. The chip is fabricated in a standard 0.6 μm CMOS process. Die size is 0.45 mm2.},

abstract={This paper presents an area efficient 10-bit, 40 MS/s SAR ADC. The design strategy to minimize the circuit area adopts the pipelined architecture. The 10-bit SAR ADC is divided into 4-bit (first stage) and 6-bit (second stage) SAR ADC. The two-stage pipelined structure achieves a reduction of the number of capacitors, which is the dominant source of the circuit area of SAR ADCs. To avoid the comparator offset issue, the proposed single-ended 1.5 bit/cycle algorithm is used in the first stage. The single-ended scheme reduces the conversion cycle while maintaining sufficient tolerance of the comparator offset. The second stage uses a pseudo C-2C architecture that is useful for minimizing the load capacitance of the residue amplifier and minimizing the circuit area. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.06 mm2, it achieves a peak SNDR of 55.1 dB and a peak SFDR of 71.5 dB at 40 MS/s sampling rate. The power consumption is 1.21 mW.},

abstract={A time-to-digital converter (TDC) is proposed to replace the multi-bit quantizer and the multi-bit feedback DAC of traditional voltage-mode ΣΔ modulator. Since time-mode systems process analog signals encoded in the time dimension rather than the voltage dimension, the proposed time-mode TDC makes the multi-bit ΣΔ ADC digital friendly and more suitable for nanometric technologies. A pulse-width-modulator (PWM) converts the sampled-and-held voltage-sample to a digital pulse whose width is proportional to the voltage level of the sample. Then, the TDC generates a digital code that corresponds to the pulse width. Simultaneously, the TDC provides a time-quantized feedback pulse for the ΣΔ modulator, emulating the voltage-DAC in a conventional ΣΔ ADC. Linearity, jitter and data-dependent-delay effects on the performance of the proposed architecture are analyzed. A chip prototype is fabricated in TI 65 nm digital CMOS process. THD of 67 dB is achieved which corresponds to a TDC's DNL of less than 0.8 ps without calibration. Measurements show that the ΣΔ-modulator achieves a dynamic range of 68 dB and the TDC consumes 5.66 mW at 250 MHz event rate while occupying 0.006 mm2.},

abstract={The integration of photodetectors for optical communication into standard nanoscale CMOS process technologies can enable low cost for emerging high volume short-reach parallel optical communication. Whereas past work has highlighted the challenges that face integrated photodetectors in highly scaled CMOS technologies, this work examines the opportunities afforded by these new technologies. First, scaling promises improved extrinsic photodetector bandwidth thanks to improved TIA performance. Second, modern advanced process features enable new photodetector structures with improved performance. A phototransistor employing deep n-wells is characterized in 65-nm CMOS and exhibits a more than ten-fold increase in responsivity over a similar structure without the buried n-well. Third, equalization techniques benefit from technology scaling and are only just beginning to be applied to CMOS integrated photodetectors. In particular, decision feedback equalization appears to offer potential for 10+ Gbps operation.},

abstract={For fully autonomous implantable or body-worn devices running on harvested energy, the peak and average power dissipation of the radio transmitter must be minimized. Additionally, link symmetry must be maintained for peer-to-peer network applications. We propose a highly integrated 90 μW 400 MHz MICS band transmitter with an output power of 20 μW, leading to a 22% global efficiency - the highest reported to date for low-power MICS band systems. We introduce a new transmitter architecture based on cascaded multi-phase injection locking and frequency multiplication to enable low power operation and high global efficiency. Our architecture eliminates slow phase/delay-locked loops for frequency synthesis and uses injection locking to achieve a settling time <;250 ns permitting very aggressive duty cycling of the transmitter to conserve energy. At a data-rate of 200 kbps, the transmitter achieves an energy efficiency of 450 pJ/bit. Our 400 MHz local oscillator topology demonstrates a figure-of-merit of 204 dB while locked to a stable crystal reference. The transmitter occupies 0.04 mm2 of active die area in 130 nm CMOS and is fully integrated except for the crystal and the matching network.},

abstract={Nanometer SRAM cannot achieve lower VDDmin due to read-disturb, half-select disturb and write failure. This paper demonstrates quantitative performance advantages of a zigzag 8T-SRAM (Z8T) cell over the decoupled single-ended sensing 8T-SRAM (DS8T) with write-back schemes, which was previously recognized as the most area-efficient cell under large σVTH/VDD conditions. Since Z8T uses only 1T for each decoupled read-port, faster 2T differential sensing (D2S) can be implemented within the same area as the single-ended DS8T. Thanks to D2S, Z8T cell enables much faster R/W speed at VDDmin than DS8T. For the same VDDmin/speed, Z8T reduces the cell area by 15%. The Z8T 32 Kb macro is 14% smaller area and 53% faster than DS8T cells. Three macros were fabricated using foundry provided 65 nm low-power and 90 nm generic processes. The measured VDDmin for a 65 nm 256-row 32 Kb and a 32-row 4 Kb macro are 430 mV and 250 mV respectively. The measured VDDmin for a 90 nm 256-row 64 Kb macro is 230 mV.},

abstract={A novel single-inductor-dual-output (SIDO) boost regulator with sequential-control is presented. This control can handle large loads or unbalanced loads with minimized cross interference between channels. A constant-charge-auto-hopping (CCAH) control is also presented to further extend the power handling capacity of the regulator with a predictable system switching noise spectrum. The switching frequency of the converter can be automatically hopped between 1 MHz and 1 MHz/N where N = 2 to 7 according to the total loads and during load transient. To minimize cross-regulation during frequency hopping, the inductor peak current is set to a predefined value according to the switching frequency information from the frequency detection unit to deliver a constant charge per switching period to the unchanged outputs. The response of the transient output is also enhanced with this inductor peak current prediction method. A prototype has been fabricated with a 0.35 μm CMOS process to verify the effectiveness of the CCAH control. With 1.8 V-2.4 V input voltage, two regulated output voltages between 3.0 V and 3.6 V, with maximum 400 mA to 600 mA driving capability and maximum power efficiency of 91.6% is achieved at total output power of 1.15 W. Load transient measurements show that the worst-case cross-regulation is 0.033 mV/mA with a 300 mA load current change at output A and 0.0714 mV/mA with a 280 mA load current change at output B. No noticeable cross-regulation can be observed with a less than 200 mA load current change.},

abstract={This paper presents a sub-radix-2 redundant architecture to improve the performance of switched-capacitor successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The redundancy not only guarantees digitally correctable static nonlinearities of the converter, it also offers means to combat dynamic errors in the conversion process, and thus, accelerating the speed of the SAR architecture. A perturbation-based digital calibration technique is also described that closely couples with the architecture choice to accomplish simultaneous identification of multiple capacitor mismatch errors of the ADC, enabling the downsizing of all sampling capacitors to save power and silicon area. A 12-bit prototype measured a Nyquist 70.1-dB signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) and a Nyquist 90.3-dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) at 22.5 MS/s, while dissipating 3.0-mW power from a 1.2-V supply and occupying 0.06-mm2 silicon area in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. The figure of merit (FoM) of this ADC is 51.3 fJ/step measured at 22.5 MS/s and 36.7 fJ/step at 45 MS/s.},

The paper focuses on the radio portion mostly, and addresses the challenges of realizing a complete GSM/EDGE SoC with the RF integrated along with the rest of digital baseband circuitry. Several circuit level as well as architectural techniques are presented to realize a very low-cost and low-power 2.5G radio while meeting the stringent cellular requirements with wide margin.

abstract={A reference-less highly digital half-rate clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit with improved tolerance to input duty cycle error is presented.

The early/late outputs of a conventional half-rate bang-bang phase detector are used to determine the duty-cycle error in the incoming random data and adjust the oscillator clock phases to maximize receiver timing margins.

pages={2171-2179}, 
abstract={A ferroelectric capacitor overdrive technique with shield-bitline drive has been demonstrated and verified by a 130 nm 576 Kb test chip with a 0.7191 μm2 cell. First, cell signal degradation and bitline-to-bitline coupling noise worsened by wide cell signal distribution in low voltage scaled FeRAMs are discussed. Next, the shield-bitline-overdrive technique is presented. This technique applies a 0.24 V higher bias to the ferroelectric capacitor through bitline-to-bitline coupling during the read operation without increasing device stress, and eliminates bitline-to-bitline coupling noise. The measured tail-to-tail cell signal is improved by 100 mV and effectively doubles for 1.3 V array operation. The area penalty of the proposed scheme is 0.9% of the 576 Kb cell array, and the access time penalty is 5 ns. The effect of this technique will be enhanced by cell shrink as the bitline-to-bitline coupling ratio increases. A tail-to-tail cell signal window of more than 200 mV is expected in 1.3 V 256 Mb and 1.2 V 512 Mb chain FeRAMs, whereas the tail-to-tail cell signal window without overdrive would degrade to 95 mV for 256 Mb and 60 mV for 512 Mb.},

pages={1857-1869}, 
abstract={This paper analyzes the energy efficiency of different transmit equalizer driver topologies. Dynamic impedance modulation is found to be the most energy-efficient mechanism for transmit pre-emphasis, when compared with impedance-maintaining current and voltage-mode drivers. The equalizing transmitter is implemented as a digital push-pull impedance-modulating (RM) driver with fully digital RAM-DAC back-end for pattern lookup. This back-end compensates for both duty-cycle distortion and driver nonlinearity, while providing a programmable pre-emphasis. A testchip fabricated in 90-nm CMOS process shows relatively small signal degradation from dynamic modulation of driver output impedance over a variety of 20" backplanes at 4 Gb/s, with energy efficiency of 2 pJ/bit at 100 mV of receiver eye. Despite this signal degradation, at the same performance point, the impedance modulating driver shows better energy efficiency than impedance-maintaining current and voltage-mode drivers.},

abstract={This paper presents a 14 bit 200 MS/s current-steering DAC with a novel digital calibration technique called dynamic-mismatch mapping (DMM). By optimizing the switching sequence of current cells to reduce the dynamic integral nonlinearity in an I-Q domain, the DMM technique digitally calibrates all mismatch errors so that both the DAC static and dynamic performance can be significantly improved in a wide frequency range. Compared to traditional current source calibration techniques and static-mismatch mapping, DMM can reduce the distortion caused by both amplitude and timing mismatch errors. Compared to dynamic element matching, DMM does not increase the noise floor since the distortion is reduced, not randomized. The DMM DAC was implemented in a 0.14 μm CMOS technology and achieves a state-of-the-art performance of SFDR >; 78 dBc, IM3 <; -83 dBc and NSD <; -163 dBm/Hz in the whole 100 MHz Nyquist band.},

abstract={A digital ΔΣ fractional-N frequency synthesizer for 4G communication standards is presented which is able to achieve wide loop bandwidth while producing low fractional spurs. The loop adopts a fractional-N divider based on a phase interpolator, allowing to shrink the TDC dynamic range and to improve its linearity. A dynamic-element matching algorithm is employed to further improve TDC linearity and an original correlation algorithm is used to correct for the phase interpolator mismatches. Both digital algorithms operate in background and they are demonstrated to be concurrently effective in reducing in-band fractional spurs below -57 dBc. The circuit is fully integrated in a 65 nm CMOS process and it synthesizes a carrier in the 3.0-3.6 GHz range from a 40 MHz crystal reference with 40 Hz resolution. It achieves -104-dBc/Hz phase noise at 400-kHz offset and a 3.2-MHz maximum loop bandwidth. The synthesizer dissipates 80 mW and occupies 0.4 mm2.},

abstract={Wireless on-chip processing at millimeter waves still lacks key functions: quadrature generation enabling direct conversion architectures and simplifying phased-array systems, frequency division with an operating range wide enough to compensate spreads due to component variations. This paper addresses the implementation of these functions, introducing new circuit solutions. The quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) relies on a ring of two tuned VCOs, where the oscillation frequency depends on inter-stage passive components only, demonstrating low noise and accurate quadrature phases. Prototypes, realized in 65-nm CMOS, show 56-60.4-GHz tunable oscillation frequency, phase noise better than 95 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset in the tuning range, 1.5 maximum phase error while consuming 22 mA from a 1-V supply. The frequency divider is based on clocked differential amplifiers, working as dynamic CML latches, achieving high speed and low power simultaneously. A divider by 4 realized in 65-nm CMOS occupies 15 m 30 m, features an operating frequency programmable from 20 to 70 GHz in nine bands and consumes 6.5 mW.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2794-2806}, 
abstract={This paper presents a power-efficient current-feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) with high gain accuracy. It is intended for interfacing precision bridge transducers and thermocouples that output mV-level signals. The gain accuracy of the CFIA is mainly limited by the mismatch of two transconductors. Applying dynamic element matching (DEM) to them ensures good gain accuracy, gain drift, and linearity. As a result, these transconductors can be implemented as simple differential pairs, resulting in significantly improved power efficiency when compared with the use of resistor-degenerated stages. To suppress the output ripple caused by DEM, an automatic gain error reduction loop dynamically nulls the Gm mismatch of the input and feedback transconductors, thus eliminating the need for trimming. The prototype chip was realized in a 0.7-μm CMOS process. Measurement results show a maximum 0.06% untrimmed gain error and a 5-ppm INL at a gain of 100. This work also achieves an NEF of 11.2, a maximum input-referred offset of 3 μV, and a CMRR of 127 dB while consuming only 290 μA at a 5-V supply.},

year={2011},

pages={1214-1222}, 
abstract={Spike sorting is an important processing step in various neuroscientific and clinical studies. Energy-efficient spike-sorting ASICs are necessary to allow real-time processing of multi-channel, wireless neural recordings. Spike-sorting ASICs have to meet stringent power-density constraints and must provide significant data-rate reduction for wireless transmission. Most existing designs either provide only spike detection for multi-channel processing, or they provide detection and feature extraction only for a single channel. In this paper, we demonstrate the design of a spike-sorting DSP chip that can perform detection, alignment, and feature extraction simultaneously for 64 channels. Spike-sorting algorithms chosen based on a complexity-performance analysis were implemented on ASIC using a MATLAB/Simulink-based architecture design framework. Energy-delay tradeoffs of the design were analyzed to identify the optimal degree of interleaving. The chip was implemented with a modular architecture, and can be configured to process 16, 32, 48, or 64 channels. Inactive cores are power-gated when the chip is operated to process a reduced number of channels. The chip, implemented in a 90-nm CMOS process, has a power dissipation of 130 μW (power density of 30 μW/mm2) when processing all 64 channels and provides a data-rate reduction of 91.25% (11.71 Mb/s to 1.02 Mb/s).},

The detailed study shows a 67% bit-line power reduction with only 1.7% area overhead, while improving a read zero margin by more than 500ps. The array voltage window is improved by the programmable BL voltage generator, allowing the embedded DRAM to operate reliably without constraining of the microprocessor voltage supply windows. The 2.5nm gate oxide transistor cell with deep-trench capacitor is accessed by the 1.7 V wordline high voltage (VPP) with V WL low voltage (VWL), and both are generated internally within the microprocessor.

To develop this low-power gearbox LSI, the power dissipation of its 25-Gb/s interface is decreased to 14 mW/Gb/s by three circuit schemes: maximizing the use of CMOS circuits, adopting a low-power circuit architecture for a current-mode-logic (CML) circuit, and minimizing clock distribution by using a flip-flop with a single-clock operation and a PLL with phase rotation for each channel. The 25-Gb/s interface in the LSI provides a transmitter output with sufficient eye opening and achieved minimum input sensitivity of 34.4-mV (peak-to-peak).},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={2}, 
pages={403-415}, 
abstract={A novel technique for mitigation of self interference in a highly integrated SoC transmitter is presented. The interference originates from the internal power amplifier (i.e., aggressor) that leads to injection pulling of the local RF oscillator (i.e., victim). The characteristic of injection pulling was found to be dependent on the AM signal applied to the power amplifier. A hypothesis describing the mechanism of injection pulling of the local oscillator is presented. A mathematical model is developed to study the characteristics of this self interference verified then by measurements. Based on this model, a digitally controlled delay circuit is proposed and implemented in a digital polar GSM/EDGE transmitter that makes the system less susceptible to injection pulling through automatic phase adjustment between the aggressor and the victim. Compliant EVM and spectrum performance is measured on SoC fabricated in 65-nm CMOS showing the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2821-2833}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 64-times interleaved 2.6 GS/s 10b successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC in 65 nm CMOS. The ADC combines interleaving hierarchy with an open-loop buffer array operated in feedforward-sampling and feedback-SAR mode. The sampling front-end consists of four interleaved T/Hs at 650 MS/s that are optimized for timing accuracy and sampling linearity, while the back-end consists of four ADC arrays, each consisting of 16 10b current-mode non-binary SAR ADCs. The interleaving hierarchy allows for many ADCs to be used per T/H and eliminates distortion stemming from open loop buffers interfacing between the front-end and back-end. Startup on-chip calibration deals with offset and gain mismatches as well as DAC linearity. Measurements show that the prototype ADC achieves an SNDR of 48.5 dB and a THD of less than 58 dB at Nyquist with an input signal of 1.4 . An estimated sampling clock skew spread of 400 fs is achieved by careful design and layout. Up to 4 GHz an SNR of more than 49 dB has been measured, enabled by the less than 110 fs rms clock jitter. The ADC consumes 480 mW from 1.2/1.3/1.6 V supplies and occupies an area of 5.1 mm.},

At the nominal 1.1 V supply, the cores operate at 1 GHz while the 2D-mesh operates at 2 GHz. As performance and voltage scales, the processor dissipates between 25 W and 125 W. The processor is implemented in 45 nm Hi-K CMOS and has 1.3 billion transistors.},

abstract={A digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) employs noise cancellation to mitigate performance degradation due to noise on the ring oscillator supply voltage. A deterministic test signal-based digital background calibration is used to accurately set the cancellation gain and thus achieve accurate cancellation under different process, voltage, temperature, and operating frequency conditions. A hybrid, linear proportional control and bang-bang digital integral control, is used to obviate the need for a high-resolution time-to-digital converter and reduce jitter due to frequency quantization error. Fabricated in 0.13 m CMOS technology, the DPLL operates from a 1.0 V supply and achieves an operating range of 0.4-to-3 GHz. At 1.5 GHz, the DPLL consumes 2.65 mW power wherein the cancellation circuitry consumes about 280 W. The proposed noise cancellation scheme reduces the DPLL's peak-to-peak jitter from 330 to 50 ps in the presence of a 30 mV 10 MHz supply noise tone, and the DPLL peak-to-peak jitter is 50 ps in the absence of any supply noise. The DPLL occupies an active die area of 0.08 mm, of which the calibration logic and cancellation circuitry occupy only 12.5%.},

title={Digital Approaches to ISI-Mitigation in High-Resolution Oversampled Multi-Level D/A Converters}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2892-2903}, 
abstract={A new digital signal processing approach to shaping intersymbol interference (ISI) and static mismatch errors simultaneously in oversampled multi-level digital to analog converters (DAC) has recently been proposed. In this paper, a mathematical framework is established for analyzing ISI errors as well as comparing the ISI sensitivities of different mismatch shaping algorithms. The framework is used to analyze the fundamental problems of popularly used algorithms such as data-weighted-averaging (DWA) in the presence of nonlinear ISI: Large-signal even-order distortion and frequency modulated harmonics at low signal levels. The new ISI-shaping algorithm results in significant improvement over previous schemes including the modified Mismatch Shaper (MMS) which also addresses ISI error. The new ISI shaper, while increasing the digital complexity, practically eliminates the need for conventional ISI mitigation techniques such as time consuming, layout-critical, non-automated and process specific analog design methods. The advantages of ISI shaping is further verified on an experimental audio DAC with simple non-return-to-zero (NRZ) current steering segments implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process and running off a single-phase clock of only 3.072 MHz.},

abstract={This paper presents a 60 GHz frequency-locked loop (FLL) for wireless sensor network applications. The FLL incorporates an on-chip patch antenna as both a radiator and a frequency reference, realizing a compact and low-cost solution for non-coherent energy detection radios. To further reduce the size of a wireless sensor node, the area beneath the patch antenna ground plane is utilized for analog and digital baseband circuitry integration. A sensor array was implemented beneath the antenna ground plane to measure the spatial coupling from the antenna to the circuitry beneath it. The FLL is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology. The operating frequency is locked to the maximum-efficiency point of the antenna with a mean of 59.34 GHz and standard deviation of 195 MHz over process variation. The circuit and antenna occupies 2.85 mm and consumes 29.6 mW.},

title={An Energy Efficient $V_{rm PP}$ Generator With Fast Ramp-Up Time for Mobile DRAM}, 
year={2011},

number={6}, 
pages={1488-1494}, 
abstract={An energy efficient VPP generator with fast ramp-up time for mobile DRAM is presented in this paper. Instead of using a fixed pumping clock frequency as in the conventional VPP generator, the proposed VPP generator adopts a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and uses variable pumping frequencies to improve the ramp-up time as well as energy efficiency. Numerical results show that the VCO based VPP generators achieve energy savings of up to 34% with 40% improvement on ramp-up time when compared to the conventional ring oscillator (RO) based design. Our proposed VPP generator, which uses a three-stage voltage doubler as a charge pump, was implemented and fabricated in CMOS 0.13 μm process. The VPP generator chip's core occupies 0.6 mm2 area and consumes 1162 nJ (average power of 47.8 mW during 24 μs ramp-up time) while generating 3.0 V output voltage with 1.0 nF load capacitor, 2.0 mA current load and 1.2 V supply voltage.},

title={A 0.5 V Operation $V _{\rm TH}$ Loss Compensated DRAM Word-Line Booster Circuit for Ultra-Low Power VLSI Systems}, 
year={2011}, 
volume={46}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2406-2415}, 
abstract={A low power high-speed word-line booster is proposed for 0.5 V operation embedded and discrete DRAMs. To realize the low power LSIs it is important to decrease the supply voltage (VDD) to e.g., 0.5 V because the active power consumption of LSIs strongly depends on VDD. When the 0.5 V VDD is adopted, widely used RAM, SRAM is difficult to operate because the SRAM is sensitive to the VTH variation. DRAM has a potential to operate at such low VDD. As the key technology to realize 0.5 V operation DRAM, this paper proposes the word-line booster circuit. The theoretical equation of the output voltage and the energy consumption of the proposed booster is extensively investigated. The proposed booster outputs 1.4 V in 3 clock cycles, which is shorter than the DRAM access time and the power consumption is 60 pJ. 1.4 V is the required word-line voltage to successfully charge the DRAM cell capacitor. Compared with the conventional boosters, the rising time and the power consumption are decreased to 38% and 68%, respectively, with the same circuit area. The proposed circuit was fabricated with the 0.18 μm standard CMOS process and the high-speed boosting is experimentally demonstrated.},

abstract={We propose a new transmitter architecture for ultra-low power radios in which the most energy-hungry RF circuits operate at a supply just above a threshold voltage of CMOS transistors. An all-digital PLL employs a digitally controlled oscillator with switching current sources to reduce supply voltage and power without sacrificing its startup margin. It also reduces 1/f noise and supply pushing, thus allowing the ADPLL, after settling, to reduce its sampling rate or shut it off entirely during a direct DCO data modulation. The switching power amplifier integrates its matching network while operating in class-E/F2 to maximally enhance its efficiency at low voltage. The transmitter is realized in 28 nm digital CMOS and satisfies all metal density and other manufacturing rules. It consumes 3.6 mW/5.5 mW while delivering 0 dBm/3 dBm RF power in Bluetooth Low-Energy mode.},

abstract={This paper describes an ultralow-power VCSEL transmitter in 32 nm SOI CMOS. To increase its power efficiency, the VCSEL is driven at a low bias current. Driving the VCSEL in this condition increases its inherent nonlinearity. Conventional pre-emphasis techniques cannot compensate for this effect because they have a linear response. To overcome this limitation, a nonlinear equalization scheme is proposed. A dynamic VCSEL modelling technique is used to generate the time-domain optical responses for “one” and “zero” bits. Based on the asymmetry of the two responses, the rising and falling edges are equalized separately. Additionally, instead of using fixed bit delays, the equalization delay is selected based on the bias current of the VCSEL. The efficiency of the proposed modelling and equalization technique is evaluated through simulations and measurements. The transmitter achieves energy efficiency of 0.77 pJ/b at 20 Gb/s and occupies 100 μm × 60 μm active silicon area.},

abstract={An ultra low-energy oscillator circuit is presented for use in picowatt level systems. The core oscillator uses an 18 transistor 3 stage architecture designed to minimize short circuit current. In addition, a transistor threshold is used to set the trip point as opposed to a voltage reference and comparator scheme, leading to overall energy savings. While operating across a wide range of low frequencies from 18 to 1000 Hz, the oscillator core consumes 110 fJ/cycle at 0.6 V. The circuit is demonstrated alongside an integrated current source to set the reference frequency. The combined system consumes a total power of 4.2 pW at 18 Hz, resulting in 230 fJ/cycle at 0.6 V.},

abstract={A three-axis automotive gyroscope ASIC for electronic stability control (ESC) with noise density that is less than 0.004°/s/√Hz in a 80 Hz bandwidth and an offset drift lower than ±0.1°/s over the automotive temperature range -40 to 140 °C, without any temperature compensation, is reported. A closed-loop, force-feedback architecture along with electromechanical quadrature cancellation enables the low noise and low offset-drift performance. The application of this work needs to meet the ASIL-D automotive safety standard which requires the highest level of automotive safety. Therefore, this work also presents a low-overhead approach for implementing accurate continuous safety monitoring to monitor defects, which can develop in the field, and can give rise to a false output. To achieve this, two test signals are injected into the quadrature cancellation loop to traverse the entire signal path. The system is clocked by a low-phase noise PLL, which allows the coexistence of the test signals and the measured signal in close proximity, without a noise penalty. The architecture of the drive loop is chosen to not only achieve low-phase noise but also robustness to parasitic mechanical modes of the sensor.},

title={Energy Recycling Telemetry IC With Simultaneous 11.5 mW Power and 6.78 Mb/s Backward Data Delivery Over a Single 13.56 MHz Inductive Link}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2664-2678}, 
abstract={We present a telemetry IC with a new data modulation scheme for efficient simultaneous transfer of power and backward data over a single inductive link. Data-driven synchronized single-cycle shorting of the secondary LC tank conserves reactive energy while inducing an instantaneous voltage change on the primary side. Contrary to conventional load shift keying modulation, the recovery time of the secondary LC oscillation after shorting improves asymptotically with increasing quality factor of the secondary LC tank. Since quality factor does not reduce the data rate, the LC tank can be simultaneously optimized for power and data telemetry, obviating the conventional tradeoff between power transfer efficiency and data rate. Cyclic ON-OFF keying time-encoded symbol data mapping of the shorting cycle allows transmission of two data bits per four carrier cycles while supporting simultaneous power delivery during at least six nonshorting out of eight half cycles. All timing control signals for rectification and data transmission are generated from a low-power clock recovery comparator and a phased-locked loop. The 0.92 mm2 65 nm CMOS IC delivers up to 11.5 mW power to the load and simultaneously transmits 6.78 Mb/s data while dissipating 64 μW power. A bit error rate of ≤9.9 × 10-8 was measured over a single 1 cm 13.56 MHz inductive link at a data rate of 6.78 Mb/s with a 10 mW load power.},

abstract={This paper presents the world's first reported chip-level 5 kVrms isolated delta-sigma ADC architecture which realizes isolation in both the power and signal domains. The compact IC package contains an integrated isolated power converter which includes an on-chip transformer, oscillator and rectifier, three delta-sigma analog-to-digital converters, a voltage reference, a temperature transducer, on-chip data transformers, and a controller/communication chip. Because it includes all of the isolation units within the same package, no PCB level isolation components are needed. This solution displaces the need for isolation using opto-couplers or costly, bulky and frequency dependent current transformers, and enables lower cost shunt resistor based current sensing applications such as domestic and industrial energy monitoring. It also enables new portable current sensing applications where high voltage isolation is required. The system-in-package (SIP) draws 12.5 mA from a 3.3 V supply and achieves 74.4 dBFS SNDR and 80.8 dBFS SFDR in a bandwidth of 3.3 kHz. It achieves an insulation voltage rating of 400 Vrms continuous and 5 kVrms over a 1 minute duration.},

abstract={This paper presents a fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (PLL) that achieves low in-band phase noise.

The latency of the TDC is addressed by the designed building blocks. The fractional spurs are reduced by dual-loop least-mean-square (LMS) calibration. A ΔΣ-less and MOS varactor-less LC digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) is proposed whose frequency resolution is enhanced to 7 kHz (or a unit variable capacitance of 2.6 aF) using a bridging capacitor technique.

abstract={This paper presents the design and the analysis of chopper stabilization circuit techniques in oscillator-based RF sensors with injection locking for dielectric spectroscopy bio-sensing applications. As the conventional phase modulation chopping scheme inevitably up-converts the 1/f phase noise intrinsically to the oscillator, we propose a near-field modulation technique that periodically shields the sensing electrical fields from fringing into the material-under-test (MUT), to achieve the desired chopping operation while avoiding the modulation of the sensor 1/f phase noise. Detailed design considerations to remedy the residual flicker noise up-conversion are discussed. The sensor prototype, implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and operated at 16 GHz, shows a reduction in the flicker-noise corner from 10 to 0.25 kHz with field-modulation enabled, yielding a noise floor of 1 ppm in frequency shift at 10 Hz filtering bandwidth. Thermal-cycled bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions are measured with the proposed sensor-on-CMOS. The results prove the potential for the permittivity measurements at microwave frequencies in detecting protein conformation change.},

abstract={Miniature mm3-sized sensor nodes have a very tight power budget, in particular, when a long operational lifetime is required, which is the case, e.g., for implantable devices or unobtrusive IoT nodes.

The IC includes also a 10 bit 1 kS/s SAR ADC as well as a clock generator and voltage and current biasing circuits. The overall system achieves an input noise of 27 μVrms, consumes 3 nW from a 0.6 V supply, occupies 0.20 mm2 in 65 nm CMOS, and has a single-wire data interface. The amplifier achieves an noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.1 and the ADC has a figure-of-merit (FoM) of 1.5 fJ/conversion-step. Measurements confirm reliable operation for supplies from 0.50 to 0.70 V and temperatures in the range of 0-85 °C.

title={A 5.6 nV/ $surd $ Hz Chopper Operational Amplifier Achieving a 0.5 $mu$ V Maximum Offset Over Rail-to-Rail Input Range With Adaptive Clock Boosting Technique},

pages={2119-2128}, 
abstract={This paper presents a standalone 5.6 nV/√Hz chopper op-amp that operates from a 2.1-5.5 V supply. Frequency compensation is achieved in a power-and area-efficient manner by using a current attenuator and a dummy differential output. As a result, the overall op-amp only consumes 1.4 mA supply current and 1.26 mm2 die area. Up-modulated chopper ripple is suppressed by a local feedback technique, called auto correction feedback (ACFB). The charge injection of the input chopping switches can cause residual offset voltages, especially with the wider switches needed to reduce thermal noise. By employing an adaptive clock boosting technique with NMOS input switches, the amount of charge injection is minimized and kept constant as the input common-mode voltage changes. This results in a 0.5 μV maximum offset and 0.015 μV/°C maximum drift over the amplifier's entire rail-to-rail input common-mode range and from -40 °C to 125 °C. The design is implemented in a 0.35 μm CMOS process augmented by 5 V CMOS transistors.},

abstract={This paper presents a primary color optical pixel sensor circuit that utilizes hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin-film transistors (TFTs). To minimize the effect of ambient light on the sensing result of optical sensor circuit, the proposed sensor circuit combines photo TFTs with color filters to sense a primary color optical input signal. A readout circuit, which also uses thin-film transistors, is integrated into the sensor circuit for sampling the stored charges in the pixel sensor circuit. Measurements demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed sensor circuit is unaffected by ambient light under illumination up to 12 000 lux by white LEDs.

pages={3049-3062}, 
abstract={This paper presents a new methodology to extract spectral information of radiated THz signals to enable a fully integrated broadband THz spectroscope in silicon. A classical down-conversion spectrum analysis architecture requires onchip generation of LO signals covering GHz-THz frequencies to analyze an incident spectrum covering that range. This paper presents a method to exploit the interaction between the front-end antenna and the incident signal to extract spectral information eliminating the need for extremely wideband LO generation and the entire receiver architecture following the antenna. The central premise is that the incident THz signal excites a spectrum-dependent current distribution on the antenna surface and this work presents a method to measure and then estimate the incident spectrum from the impressed current distribution on an onchip antenna. The chip is implemented in 0.13 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology and measures 2.6 mm×1.9 mm. Measurement results are presented for various incident spectra between 40-330 GHz. In addition, the paper presents a method for extracting time-domain information by exploiting the variable nonlinearities of the integrated detectors. By modifying a classical single-port antenna into a 2D multi-port scatterer, the paper presents a synthesizer-free THz spectroscope which consists of an integrated scatterer and multitude of low-power sensors capable of subwavelength measurement of near-field interactions which are exploited for spectral estimation.},

abstract={This paper describes a novel low-noise input-termination-less cascode distributed amplifier (DA) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) design. The design was implemented with a 0.15 μm gate gallium nitride on silicon carbide GaN-SiC high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) 6 inch wafer process technology. The GaN MMIC achieves a bandwidth from 100 MHz-45 GHz with greater than 10 dB gain and previously benchmarked the first published mm-wave MMIC results produced on a 6 inch GaN on SiC wafer process technology. The unique input-gate-termination-less DA topology reduces the low-frequency noise figure (NF) of the conventional resistive-terminated DA without compromising the third order intercept point (IP3) linearity. The new design achieves 1.6 dB NF at 250 MHz and a NF improvement of at least 1 dB and as much as 4 dB or greater for frequencies below 5 GHz compared to the conventional DA approach. The GaN MMIC also achieves an average mid-band NF of 2.5-3 dB, a saturated output power (Psat) of 1 Watt, and a mid-band output IP3 of 38 dBm. The new design architecture combined with the inherent device characteristics of GaN-SiC technology can provide performance benefits for next-generation coherent fiber optic, instrumentation and advanced broadband radio architecture applications.},

abstract={This paper presents the first linear bulk CMOS power amplifier (PA) targeting low-power fifth-generation (5G) mobile user equipment integrated phased array transceivers. The output stage of the PA is first optimized for power-added efficiency (PAE) at a desired error vector magnitude (EVM) and range given a challenging 5G uplink use case scenario. Then, inductive source degeneration in the optimized output stage is shown to enable its embedding into a two-stage transformer-coupled PA; by broadening interstage impedance matching bandwidth and helping to reduce distortion. Designed and fabricated in 1P7M 28 nm bulk CMOS and using a 1 V supply, the PA achieves +4.2 dBm/9% measured Pout/PAE at -25 dBc EVM for a 250 MHz-wide 64-quadrature amplitude modulation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal with 9.6 dB peak-to-average power ratio. The PA also achieves 35.5%/10% PAE for continuous wave signals at saturation/9.6 dB back-off from saturation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these are the highest measured PAE values among published K-and Ka-band CMOS PAs.},

The converters achieve high efficiency at the system level by switching simultaneously to avoid charge-sharing losses and by using an adaptive clock to maximize performance for the resulting voltage ripple. Details about the implementation of the DC-DC switches, DC-DC controller, and adaptive clock are provided, and the sources of conversion loss are analyzed based on measured results. This system pushes the capabilities of dynamic voltage scaling by enabling fast transitions (20 ns), simple packaging (no off-chip passives), low area overhead (16%), high conversion efficiency (80%-86%), and high energy efficiency (26.2 DP GFLOPS/W) for mobile devices.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1398-1409}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully digital quantization noise reduction algorithm (DQNRA) for CTΣΔM. The algorithm overcomes the signal leakage issues commonly found in cascade and MASH implementations. The proposed DQNRA is robust to PVT variations. The DQNRA performs a foreground measurement of the modulators noise transfer function. A ΣΔM using a 7 bit quantizer, from which the four most significant bits are used for the operation of the ΣΔM, proves the DQNRA concept. The remaining three least significant bits are used for the realization of the DQNRA for quantization noise improvement. A 7 bit quantizer with a three-step subranging architecture is implemented to reduce power and area consumption. A fourth-order continuous-time ΣΔ prototype was implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology. The modulator's total power consumption is 20 mW, with only 6 mW used for the realization of the 7 bit quantizer operating at 500 MHz. For this prototype, the use of a DQNRA algorithm improved the modulator's SNDR from 69 to 75 dB over a 15 MHz bandwidth, limited after calibration by thermal noise rather than quantization noise. The obtained FoM is 164 dB.},

abstract={Conventional content addressable memory (BCAM and TCAM) uses specialized 10T/16T bit cells that are significantly larger than 6T SRAM cells. A new BCAM/TCAM is proposed that can operate with standard push-rule 6T SRAM cells, reducing array area by 2-5× and allowing reconfiguration of the SRAM as a CAM. In this way, chip area and overall capacitance can be reduced, leading to higher energy efficiency for search operations. In addition, the configurable memory can perform bit-wise logical operations: “AND” and “NOR” on two or more words stored within the array. Thus, the configurable memory with CAM and logical function capability can be used to off-load specific computational operations to the memory, improving system performance and efficiency. Using a 6T 28 nm FDSOI SRAM bit cell, the 64×64 (4 kb) BCAM achieves 370 MHz at 1 V and consumes 0.6 fJ/search/bit. A logical operation between two 64 bit words achieves 787 MHz at 1 V.},

abstract={A 2.4 GHz interferer-resilient wake-up receiver for ultra-low power wireless sensor nodes uses an uncertain-IF dualconversion topology, combining a distributed multi-stage N-path filtering technique with an unlocked low-Q resonator-referred local oscillator.

The 65 nm CMOS receiver prototype provides a sensitivity of -97 dBm and a carrier-to-interferer ratio better than -27 dB at 5 MHz offset, for a data rate of 10 kb/s at a 10-3 bit error rate, while consuming 99 μW from a 0.5 V voltage supply under continuous operation.},

abstract={An active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) display driver IC, enabling real-time thin-film transistor (TFT) nonuniformity compensation, is presented with a hybrid driving method to satisfy fast driving speed, high TFT current accuracy, and a high aperture ratio. The proposed hybrid column-driver IC drives a mobile UHD (3840 × 2160) AMOLED panel, with one horizontal time of 7.7 μs at a scan frequency of 60 Hz, simultaneously senses the TFT current for back-end TFT variation compensation. Due to external compensation, a simple 3T1C pixel circuit is employed in each pixel. Accurate current sensing and high panel noise immunity is guaranteed by a proposed current-sensing circuit. By reusing the hybrid column-driver circuitries, the driver embodies an 8 bit current-mode ADC to measure OLED V -I transfer characteristic for OLED luminance-degradation compensation. Measurement results show that the hybrid driving method reduces the maximum current error between two emulated TFTs with a 60 mV threshold voltage difference under 1 gray-level error of 0.94 gray level (37 nA) in 8 bit gray scales from 12.82 gray level (501 nA). The circuit-reused current-mode ADC achieves 0.56 LSB DNL and 0.75 LSB INL.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3078-3092}, 
abstract={We present an analog subsampling PLL based on a digital-to-time converter (DTC), which operates with almost no performance gap (176/198 fs RMS jitter) between the integer and the worst case fractional operation, achieving -246.6 dB FOM in the worst case fractional mode. The PLL is capable of two-point, 10 Mbit/s GMSK modulation with -40.5 dB EVM around a 10.24 GHz fractional carrier. The analog nonidealities-DTC gain, DTC nonlinearity, modulating VCO bank gain, and nonlinearity-are calibrated in the background while the system operates normally. This results in ~15 dB fractional spur improvement (from -41 dBc to -56.5 dBc) during synthesis and ~15 dB EVM improvement (from -25 dB to -40.5 dB) during modulation. The paper provides an overview of the mechanisms that contribute to performance degradation in DTC-based PLL/phase modulators and presents ways to mitigate them. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in nanoscale CMOS for fractional-N synthesis and phase modulation.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1261-1273}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a mm-wave frequency generation technique that improves its phase noise (PN) performance and power efficiency. The main idea is that a fundamental 20 GHz signal and its sufficiently strong third harmonic at 60 GHz are generated simultaneously in a single oscillator. The desired 60 GHz local oscillator (LO) signal is delivered to the output, whereas the 20 GHz signal can be fed back for phase detection in a phase-locked loop. Third-harmonic boosting and extraction techniques are proposed and applied to the frequency generator. A prototype of the proposed frequency generator is implemented in digital 40 nm CMOS. It exhibits a PN of -100 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from 57.8 GHz and provides 25% frequency tuning range (TR). The achieved figure-of-merit (FoM) is between 179 and 182 dBc/Hz.},

title={A 16 nm All-Digital Auto-Calibrating Adaptive Clock Distribution for Supply Voltage Droop Tolerance Across a Wide Operating Range}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={1}, 
pages={8-17}, 
abstract={A 16 nm all-digital auto-calibrating adaptive clock distribution (ACD) enhances processor core performance and energy efficiency by mitigating the adverse effects of high-frequency supply voltage (VDD) droops. The ACD integrates a tunable-length delay prior to the global clock distribution to prolong the clock-data delay compensation in core paths for multiple cycles after a droop occurs to provide a sufficient response time for clock frequency (FCLK) adaptation. A dynamic variation monitor (DVM) detects the onset of the droop and interfaces with an adaptive control unit and clock divider to reduce FCLK in half at the TLD output to avoid path timing-margin failures. An auto-calibration circuit enables in-field, low-latency tuning of the DVM to accurately detect VDD droops across a wide range of operating conditions. The auto-calibration circuit maximizes the VDD-droop tolerance of the ACD while eliminating the overhead from tester calibration. From 109 die measurements across a wafer, the auto-calibrating ACD recovers a minimum of 90% of the throughput loss due to a 10% VDD droop in a conventional design for 100% of the dies. ACD measurements demonstrate simultaneous throughput gains and energy reductions ranging from 13% and 5% at 0.9 V to 30% and 13% at 0.6 V, respectively.},

year={2016},

number={8}, 
pages={1756-1770}, 
abstract={This paper presents a highly linear dual-band mixed-mode polar power amplifier (PA) fully integrated in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process. An ultra-compact single-transformer-based passive network provides optimum load impedance transformations simultaneously at two operating frequencies, parallel power combining, and even-harmonic rejection without any tuning elements or band selection switches. The mixed-mode PA architecture leverages both digital and analog techniques to dynamically suppress the AM-AM and AM-PM distortions, achieving high linearity. As a proof-of-concept design, a dual-band mixed-mode polar PA is implemented in a standard 65 nm CMOS process. It demonstrates a peak output power of +28.1 dBm/+26.0 dBm with a PA drain efficiency of 40.7%/27.0% at 2.6 GHz/4.5 GHz, respectively. The measured 2nd harmonic rejection for the 2.35 GHz signal is 36 dB. Modulation tests with 8 MSym/s 256-QAM signals achieve the measured rms EVM of 1.53%/1.87% with the average output power of +20.37 dBm/+18.53 dBm and the PA drain efficiency of 16.26%/13.42% at 2.35 GHz/4.7 GHz, demonstrating a highly linear and efficient dual-band mixed-mode polar PA.},

abstract={Silicon micro-ring modulators have the potential to enable energy efficient, high-bandwidth-density optical interconnects in CMOS compatible silicon technologies. However, their operation is highly susceptible to any thermal, laser wavelength or process variations and, as such, require a feedback control system for guaranteeing stable modulation. This paper demonstrates wavelength locking of a hybrid CMOS-silicon photonics ring-based transmitter using a 40 nm CMOS circuit to directly monitor the optical modulation amplitude (OMA) at the drop port of the ring modulator. OMA stabilization with an accuracy of <; 10 pm (~0.125 °C or within - 2% of the maximum OMA), a tracking speed of 5 nm/s (62.5 °C/s), and a tuning range of 5 nm (62.5 °C) is demonstrated by subjecting the photonic transmitter both to thermal and laser wavelength variations under dynamic modulation at 2 Gbps. The demonstrated wavelength locking concept is also robust to the variations in the input laser power and can be implemented with low power.},

abstract={A single-photon, time-gated, 160 × 120 pixel imager is presented for its application in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Exploiting single-photon avalanche diodes and an extremely compact pixel circuitry-only seven MOSFETs and one MOSCAP-the imager is capable of gathering information about photon position, number, and time distribution, enabling cost-effective devices for scientific imaging applications. This is achieved thanks to the photon counting and time-gating capabilities implemented in the analog domain, which in turn enable a 15 μm pixel with a 21% fill-factor. A reconfigurable column circuitry supports both the analog conventional readout and a self-referenced analog-to-digital conversion, able to cancel out the pixel-to-pixel nonuniformities, and speeding up the framerate to 486 fps. The imager, featuring also a delay locked loop to stabilize the internal waveform generation for reliable timing performance, has been implemented in a standard high-voltage 0.35 μm CMOS technology. Measurements in a fluorescent lifetime setup have been performed, comparing the results with single-point acquisitions made with commercial time-correlated equipment.},

abstract={Continuous-time data conversion and continuous-time DSP are an interesting alternative to conventional methods of signal conversion and processing. This alternative does not suffer from aliasing, shows superior spectral properties (e.g., no quantization noise floor), and enables event-driven flexible signal processing capabilities using digital circuits, thus scaling well with technology. However, this approach has so far been limited by the power dissipation of the continuous-time ADC. We present a novel continuous-time ADC architecture suitable for this approach, that allows a programmable, highly compact, and power-efficient circuit implementation, while preserving the benefits of continuous-time ADC/DSP systems. In the process, first-order quantization error spectral shaping has been added, which improves the baseband SNDR. Implemented in 0.65-V 28-nm FDSOI process, the 0.0032mm2 ADC achieves 32-42 dB SNDR over a 10-50 MHz bandwidth while consuming 24μW, giving an FOM of 3-10 fJ/conversion-step. The ADC shows signal-amplitude-dependent power dissipation with a zero-input power of 8 μW.},

volume={51},

pages={1302-1312}, 
abstract={A monolithic microwatt-level charge pump energy harvester is proposed for smart nodes of Internet of Things (IOT) networks. Due to the variation of the available voltage and power in IOT scenarios, the charge pump was optimized by the proposed architecture and circuit level innovations. First, a reconfigurable charge pump is introduced to provide the hybrid conversion ratios (CRs) as 1[1/3]× up to 8× for minimizing the charge redistribution loss. Second, the reconfigurable feature also dynamically tunes to maximum power point tracking (MPPT) with the frequency modulation, resulting in a two-dimensional (2-D) MPPT. Therefore, the voltage conversion efficiency (VCE) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are enhanced and flattened. Third, the constanton-time (COT) scheme from the regulation part was reused with the proposed MPPT arbiter as a sensing approach, which eliminates the conventional power hungry current sensor. The proposed energy harvester is capable of harvesting various energy sources, such as a photovoltaic (PV) cell and a thermoelectric generator (TEG), with a wide input range from 0.45 to 3 V and a regulated 3.3 V output voltage for the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the harvester achieved a flattened and improved PCE as high as 89% for ultra-low power operation capability below 50 μW.},

abstract={An area-efficient, time-domain folding ADC achieves a 10 GS/s conversion speed and a 6 bit resolution in 65 nm CMOS. The natural time-domain folding effect of the ring oscillator (RO) leads to an inherently linear and compact folding operation. The single front-end voltage-to-time converter (VTC) running at the full conversion speed obviates any input buffer or clock-skew calibration often needed in large arrays of time-interleaved (TI) ADCs. The converter back-end consists of a four-way TI, RO-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) array with inherent dynamic element matching (DEM) that achieves high conversion speed and good linearity simultaneously. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process with an active area of only 0.073 mm2. Thanks to the built-in DEM, the measured DNL and INL are +0.27/-0.28 LSBs and +0.48/-0.49 LSBs, respectively. The measured SFDR and SNDR are over 42 dB and 27 dB with a Nyquist input at 10 GS/s.},

title={A 10 MHz Bandwidth, 70 dB SNDR Continuous Time Delta-Sigma Modulator With Digitally Improved Reconfigurable Blocker Rejection}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={3}, 
pages={660-670}, 
abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time third-order low-pass delta-sigma modulator (DSM) with digitally enhanced out-of-band (OOB) signal filtering for enhanced blocker rejection in receiver analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). It is well known that strong OOB interferers define the required dynamic range (DR) of a receiver. Usually, a channel-select filter (CSF) is therefore required, together with the succeeding ADC. The feedback-compensated DSM can relax the CSF with its signal transfer characteristic. In this work, this is improved with a reconfigurable digital filter, which modifies the feedback signal of the outer-loop DAC to increase the OOB blocker rejection of the modulator. As a proof of concept, the digitally improved blocker rejection is shown in a prototype design. Additionally, a reconfigurable excess loop delay compensation technique based on an adaptive delay-locked-loop (DLL) has been implemented. The prototype is realized in a 90 nm CMOS technology, works at 480 MHz clock frequency, requires an area of 0.17 mm2, and achieves an in-band (IB) SNDR of 70 dB in a bandwidth of 10 MHz with a power consumption less than 14.4 mW. In the prototype, a digitally reconfigurable blocker rejection is realized achieving 6 dB additional suppression from 20 or 40 MHz on, or even 25 dB at the specific frequency of 20 MHz.},

abstract={A 1.1 Mb embedded DRAM macro (eDRAM), for next-generation IBM SOI processors, employs 14 nm FinFET logic technology with 0.0174 μm2 deep-trench capacitor cell.

abstract={While analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based serial link receivers enable powerful digital equalization for high data rate operation, the ADC and digital equalization power consumption is a key concern in applications that support operation over a wide range of channels with varying amounts of intersymbol interference (ISI).

Fabricated in general purpose (GP) 65 nm CMOS, the hybrid ADC-based receiver occupies 0.81 mm2 area. 10 Gb/s operation is verified for FR4 channels with up to 36.4 dB attenuation, with the proposed dynamic enabling of the digital 4-tap FFE and 3-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) on a per-symbol basis resulting in nearly 30 mW savings and an overall receiver power less than 90 mW.},

pages={1619-1629}, 
abstract={Single-bit continuous-time sigma-delta modulators (CTDSMs) are overly sensitive to clock jitter when a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) feedback DAC is used. One way of addressing this problem is to use a DAC with an exponentially decaying pulse shape, realized using a switched capacitor (SC). Existing variants of the SC feedback DAC degrade linearity due to the high peak-to-average ratio of the feedback waveform and severely compromise the alias rejection of the modulator around multiples of the sampling frequency. We introduce the dual switched-capacitor return-to-zero (Dual-SCRZ) DAC, which combines the low clock jitter sensitivity of a switched-capacitor DAC with the low peak-to-average ratio characteristic of NRZ feedback. Further, this DAC preserves the implicit anti-aliasing feature of the CTDSMs around all odd multiples of the sampling frequency. A single-bit CTDSMs that uses the Dual-SCRZ technique and opamp-assistance to improve linearity and reduce jitter sensitivity achieves 91/85.1/83 dB DR/SNR/SNDR in a 2 MHz bandwidth. Operating at 256 MHz in a 0.18 μm CMOS process, the modulator dissipates 14.8 mW from a 1.8 V supply.},

abstract={An adaptive on/off delay-compensation technique is proposed to improve the performance of CMOS active rectifiers for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The effects of the on/off delays on the performance of the active rectifiers with either a parallel-resonant or a series-resonant circuit at the secondary coil are studied, which include power conversion efficiency (PCE), voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and output voltage ripple. By adding two feedback loops to the active diodes to generate the switched-offset currents for the comparators adaptively, both onand off-delays are compensated for accurately against PVT variations and mismatches. As a design example, a fully integrated active rectifier for biomedical applications with a parallel-resonant secondary was fabricated in a standard 0.35 μm CMOS process. With an AC input that ranges from 1.8 to 3.6 V, the measured VCR is higher than 90% and the measured PCE is higher than 89.1% for a load resistor of 500 Ω. In particular, the PCE is increased by 9% compared to the active rectifier without using the proposed technique.},

title={Integrated Inverse Class-F Silicon Power Amplifiers for High Power Efficiency at Microwave and mm-Wave}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2420-2434}, 
abstract={This paper presents two 2-stage inverse class-F power amplifiers (PAs) at 24 GHz and 38 GHz, integrated in 0.13 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The PAs are composed of an inverse class-F output stage proceeded by a class-AB driving amplifier. An inter-stage matching network between the driver and output stage delivers an optimal inter-stage power to the output stage with a maximum PAE in the driver amplifier. The output stage's load network based on multi-resonance LC resonators terminates harmonic impedance explicitly up to the third of the fundamental signal. By leveraging a native low capacitive reactance, the class-F-1 load network shapes a quasi-rectangular current waveform that effectively contains up to the fifth harmonic spectral component. A high impedance control is limited up to the second harmonic, shaping a half-sinusoid voltage peaking induced by DC, fundamental, and the second harmonic voltage spectra. The 24 GHz PA achieves 50% peak PAE, 16 dBm OP-1dB, 18 dBm Psat, and 19 dB saturated power gain with 2.3 V supply voltage at 24 GHz. The 24 GHz PA can maintain >45% PAE over 23.5-25.5 GHz and 1.5-2.4 V supply voltage range, manifesting a PAE robustness to the frequency and supply variations. For 38 GHz PA, measurements show 38.5% peak PAE, 15 dBm OP-1dB, 17 dBm Psat with 15 dB of saturated power gain at the OP-1dB point when 2.4 V supply voltage is applied. The 38 GHz PA can sustain >35% PAE over 36-39 GHz and 1.5-2.5 V supply variation. The PAs also are tested under the input of band-limited signals modulated by various modulation schemes including 8-PSK, QAM, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 128QAM, and test results are presented in this paper. The chip size is 0.95 × 0.6 mm2 for 24 GHz PA and 0.93 × 0.55 mm2 for 38 GHz PA, including all pads.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a 5-channel driver array IC with a high total output current of 5×120 mA and a 6 Vpp differential output voltage in SiGe bipolar technology. Special attention is given to design considerations for stable electrical and thermal operation and to the minimization of cross-coupling between the array channels. The related driver array is intended to realize a low-cost, small footprint 10×11.3 Gbit/s dense wavelength division multiplexing transmitter assembly, consisting of a pair of two driver ICs with a chip-to-chip bondwire interface to a ten-channel Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). The driver IC contains all required components, including the far-end terminations of the MZMs as well as an energy-efficient concept for flexible MZM biasing. Current hogging in the transistors of the output stages is mitigated by a novel circuit concept that is introduced along with an electro-thermal model for dense multi-transistor arrangements, especially in driver output stages. The performance of the design is demonstrated by measurement results of the driver array IC in both standalone and integrated PIC assemblies.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2554-2569}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 64 × 2 channel stereo-audio sensing front end with parallel asynchronous event output inspired by the biological cochlea. Each binaural channel performs feature extraction by analog bandpass filtering, and the filtered signal is encoded into events via asynchronous delta modulation (ADM). The channel central frequencies J0 are geometrically scaled across the human hearing range. Two design techniques are highlighted to achieve the high system power efficiency: source-follower-based bandpass filters (BPFs) and asynchronous delta modulation (ADM) with adaptive self-oscillating comparison. The chip was fabricated in 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS, and occupies an area of 10.5×4.8 mm2. The core cochlea system operating under a 0.5 V power supply consumes 55 μW at an output rate of 100k event/s. The measured range of J0 is from 8 Hz to 20 kHz, and the BPF quality factor Q can be tuned from 1 to almost 40. The 1σ mismatch of J0 and Q between two ears is 3.3% and 15%, respectively, across all channels at Q ≈ 10. Reconstruction of speech input from the event output of the chip is performed to validate the information integrity in event-domain representation, and vowel discrimination is demonstrated as a simple application using histograms of the output events. This type of silicon cochlea front end targets integration with embedded event-driven processors for low-power smart audio sensing with classification capabilities, such as voice activity detection and speaker identification.},

abstract={This paper presents a load-adaptive Class-G headphone amplifier to improve the power efficiency for different headphone impedances. For an impedance value, the amplifier utilizes two techniques, voltage rails selection and Class-G switching activity control, to reduce the power dissipation of the amplifier and the power loss of a Class-G power generator, respectively. In addition, a supply-rejection bandwidth enhancement technique for the Class-AB output stage is proposed to suppress the out-of-band noise by the Class-G supply rails switching. Compared with the conventional fixed 2-level Class-G amplifier, the integrated 0.18 μm CMOS amplifier improves the total-path efficiency to 37% from 31% (1.45 mA current can be saved from a 1.8 V supply) while delivering 5 mW into a 16 Ω. The PSRR of the amplifier is 130 dB at 217 Hz and is still larger than 100 dB up to 20 kHz. Finally, the decoder and amplifier together achieve 108 dB DR and 95 dB SNDR with a 16 Ω headphone load.},

abstract={This paper presents a 1.9 GHz linear power amplifier (PA) architecture that improves its power efficiency in the power back-off (PBO) region. The combination of power transistor segmentation and digital gain compensation effectively enhances its power efficiency. A fast switching scheme is proposed, such that PA drivers and segments are switched ON and OFF according to signal power; thus, the PA power consumption correlates with the power of the input signal. Binary power gain variations due to PA segmentation are dynamically compensated in the digital domain. The proposed solution overcomes the tradeoffs between power efficiency and linearity by employing the digital predistortion technique. The PA is implemented in a 40 nm CMOS process. It delivers a saturated output power of 35 dBm with 44.9% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) and a linear gain of 38 dB. The adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) at ±5 MHz at a maximum linear output power of 31 dBm for a baseband WCDMA signal is -35.8 dBc.},

abstract={In order to realize optical interconnection for high-speed low-latency direct-attached storage in a data center, we developed double-threshold automatic gain control (AGC) that enables reliable optical out-of-band (OOB) transmission in de facto standard storage interfaces such as Serial ATA (SATA) and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). OOB is quasiternary signaling composed of differential burst signals separated by idle conditions and is poorly compatible with general optical interconnections. It has excessively large gain and substantially affects noise-susceptible idle conditions. 12.5 Gb/s driver and receiver ICs with the double-threshold AGC were fabricated in TSMC 90 nm CMOS process. The double-threshold AGC enabled reliable optical OOB transmission by noise rejection in the idle conditions and by excess gain reduction for suppression of ringing and decay after the burst signals. As a result, optically connected SATA 6 Gb/s transmission was realized for the first time.},

abstract={A novel error correction scheme, called reset-checkreverse-flag (RCRF), is proposed to improve the reliability of storage class memories (SCMs). RCRF divides the conventional Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) code length into multiple subsections. One flag bit is added to each subsection to correct program errors. By reversing the flag bit and user data, at least one reset error in each subsection can be recovered. A 4 Mbit carbon nanotube (CNT) based nano-random access memory (NRAM) cell array is measured to verify this scheme. During 108 write cycles, it is demonstrated that RCRF reduces the program bit error rate (BER) by 50% and only requires 0.4% extra array area for the flag bits. Next, BCH ECC is applied after RCRF to correct the remaining errors. Compared with the conventional BCH ECC-only approach, the proposed combination of RCRF and BCH ECC reduces parity overhead by 35% and ECC decoding latency by 16%. Therefore, RCRF is especially suited for read-intensive types of data storage, such as video and audio. On the other hand, for high endurance applications, RCRF and BCH ECC is also effective to improve the cycling reliability of resistive memories, and 50 times endurance extension is demonstrated for a 50 nm AlxOy resistive RAM (ReRAM) test chip.},

With the unity-power-gain frequency fmax of the NMOS transistor being below 300 GHz, the TX adopts a power amplifier-less QAM-capable architecture employing a highly linear subharmonic mixer called a cubic mixer. It is based on and as compact as a tripler and enables the massive power combining necessary above fmax without undue layout complication. The frequency-dependent characteristics of the cubic mixer are studied, and it is shown that even higher data rates of up to 30 Gb/s are possible at certain frequencies, where the channel signal-to-noise ratio is high. The design and the operation of the power-splitting and power-combining circuits are also described in detail. The measurements reported herein were all made “wired” via a WR3.4 waveguide.},

abstract={A highly integrated synchronous buck converter with a predictive dead time control for input voltages >18 V with 10 MHz switching frequency is presented. A high resolution dead time of ~125 ps allows to reduce dead time dependent losses without requiring body diode conduction to evaluate the dead time. High resolution is achieved by frequency compensated sampling of the switching node and by an 8 bit differential delay chain. Dead time parameters are derived in a comprehensive study of dead time depended losses. This way, the efficiency of fast switching DC-DC converters can be optimized by eliminating the body diode forward conduction losses, minimizing reverse recovery losses and by achieving zero voltage switching. High-speed circuit blocks for fast switching operation are presented including level shifter, gate driver, PWM generator. The converter has been implemented in a 180 nm high-voltage BiCMOS technology. The power losses were measured to be reduced by up to 31% by the proposed dead time control, which results in a 5.3% efficiency increase at VIN =18 V, VOUT =5 V, and 0.45 A load. At VIN =12 V, the peak efficiency is 81.2% with an efficiency improvement of 6% with dead time control.},

abstract={This paper presents a capacitive-discharging oscillator architecture that achieves ultra-low-power operation without a temperature-stabilized reference generator by directly relying on the RC time constants of capacitors discharging across passively-temperature-stabilized resistive elements. The architecture operates by pre-charging two capacitors to the supply voltage, and then discharging one of the capacitors through a resistive path, while the other capacitor charge-shares with a third capacitor in order to generate a reference potential for comparison to flip phases. The architecture is demonstrated with two fully-integrated implementations in two different process technologies: 250 nm and 65 nm. The 250 nm implementation employs poly resistors, operates at 6.4 kHz, consumes 75.6 nW, and achieves a temperature stability of 0.74% (148 ppm/°C) from 20°C to 80°C when measured over five samples. The 65 nm implementation employs gate-leakage resistors, operates at 2.8 Hz, consumes 44.4 pW, and achieves a temperature stability of 1260 ppm/°C across a temperature range of -40°C to 60°C over five samples. The two implementations demonstrate low-cost, low-power, and stable timing solutions at Hz-to-kHz-range frequencies for next-generation Internet-of-Things sensors.},

abstract={This paper presents an integrated photovoltaic energy harvester that is capable of performing global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) with significant reductions in MPPT transient time, power dissipation and silicon area. A fasttransient global search algorithm is proposed to identify the GMPP of a solar panel within hundreds of μs in the presence of multiple local maxima during partial shading conditions. The pulse integration based MPPT circuitry enables highprecision MPPT. Ripple-based irradiance aware adaptive frequency control (IAAFC) is also developed to lower the switching power loss under low irradiance levels, improving the harvester power efficiency over a wide output power range. The proposed energy harvester was implemented in 50 V 0.35 μm CMOS. It tracks the GMPP in 350 μs in the presence of two local maxima with 99% GMPP tracking efficiency. The IAAFC enables the proposed harvester to achieve > 85% power efficiency over a wide power range from 0.98 to 21 W with the peak power efficiency of 94.2% at 1 MHz. The proposed harvester improves the MPPT transient time and the power density by at least 4.5 times and 6 times, respectively, compared with state-ofthe-art counterparts.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51},

pages={893-907}, 
abstract={The microring resonator is critical for dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) chip-to-chip optical I/O, enabling modulation and channel selection at the μm-scale suitable for a VLSI chip. Microring-based links, however, require active tuning to counteract process and thermo-optic variations. Here, we present a bit-statistical tuner that decouples tracking of optical one and zero-levels to realize non-dc-balanced data transmission, an “eye-max”-locking controller, and self-heating cancellation without need for a high-speed sensing frontend. We implement the tuner on a 45 nm CMOS-SOI process with monolithically integrated photonic devices and circuits. The tuner consumes 0.74 mW in the logic while achieving a record 524 GHz (> 50 K temperature) tuning range at 3.8 μW/GHz heater efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the highest range and heater efficiency reported by an on-chip closed-loop thermal tuner to date. The tuner integrates with a 5 Gb/s 30 fJ/bit monolithic microring transmitter, achieving wavelength-lock and immunity to both tracking failures and self-heating events caused by arbitrary, nondc-balanced bitstreams. In addition, the tuner provides critical functionality for an 11-λ DWDM transmitter macro capable of 11 × 8 Gb/s bandwidth on a fiber. Together with the transmitter, a 10 Gb/s on-chip monolithic optical receiver with 10-12 BER sensitivity of 9 μA at 10 Gb/s enables a sub-pJ/bit 5 Gb/s optical chip-to-chip link, with the bit-statistical tuner providing thermally robust microring operation.},

TPCOs are used to triple their fundamental frequencies to 0.53-0.56 THz, while ILFDs and the subsequent divider chain are used to divide such frequencies to 2.7-2.9 GHz. Its back end consists of separate frequency and phase-locked loops with unique CMOS circuit designs to accomplish the desirable frequency/phase locking, including: 1) band-selection inductor switches; 2) simultaneous bulk voltage tuning over TPCOs and the first ILFD; and 3) a dual port injection architecture for the first ILFD.

pages={2830-2842}, 
abstract={This paper presents a new power conversion method that can achieve both high efficiency and high power density by obviating the need for an area-consuming flying capacitor and replacing it with a flying digital load. The proposed flying-domain (FD) power conversion concept enables higher conversion efficiency than a conventional switched-capacitor converter by reducing charge-sharing and bottom-plate parasitic losses, while also enabling higher power density by eliminating the area occupied by the flying passive itself. This paper presents state-space analysis that shows that the proposed FD concept is well posed and reaches a valid steady state, while also presenting experimental results of several FD converters implemented in 180 nm SOI. With no flying passives, the fabricated FD converter achieves a peak efficiency of 99.2%, delivers up to 11.8 W/mm2 (2.3 W/mm2 with decoupling) at 91.7% efficiency, and can directly power a cofabricated Cortex M0 processor that communicates via flying I/O level shifters.},

abstract={A wideband and low phase noise quadrature local oscillation (LO) signal generator for multistandard cellular transceivers was proposed. Using the new LO-plan consisting of divide-by-6, divide-by-4, and divide-by-12 frequency dividers, the required frequency-tuning range (FTR) of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) was reduced to 39%, which can be easily covered by a single LC-VCO. Due to the reduced FTR, the VCO can retain a high Q-factor and achieve low phase noise. The key building block of the new LO-plan is a quadrature divide-by-6 divider, capable of generating precise I/Q signals. To implement the quadrature divide-by-6 divider, we proposed a fully differential divide-by-3 divider with 50% duty cycle. Using the same idea, a fully differential divide-by-2 circuit was also proposed for divideby-4 and divide-by-12 dividers. The proposed LO-generator was fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process, and covered LO-frequencies of 0.56-2.92 GHz for multistandard cellular transceivers. The LOgenerator occupied a small silicon area of 0.15 mm2 and achieved an excellent phase noise performance of -141.02 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset from a 709 MHz LO-frequency.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={1}, 
pages={281-290}, 
abstract={This paper presents a large-area image sensing and detection system that integrates, on glass, sensors and thin-film transistor (TFT) circuits for classifying images from sensor data. Large-area electronics (LAE) enables the formation of millions of sensors spanning physically large areas; however, to perform processing functions, thousands of sensor signals must be interfaced to CMOS ICs, posing a critical limitation to system scalability. This work presents an approach whereby image detection of shapes is performed using simple circuits in the LAE domain based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) TFTs. This reduces the interfaces to the CMOS domain. The limited computational capability of TFT circuits as well as high variability and high density of process defects affecting TFTs and sensors is overcome using a machine-learning algorithm known as error-adaptive classifier boosting (EACB) to form embedded weak classifiers. Through EACB, we show that high-dimensional sensor data from a-Si photoconductors can be reduced to a small number of weak-classifier decisions, which can then be combined in CMOS to achieve strong-classifier performance. For demonstration, a system classifying five shapes achieves performance of >85%/>95% [true-positive (tp)/true-negative (tn) rates] [near the level of an ideal software-implemented support vector machine (SVM) classifier], while the total number of signals from 36 sensors in the LAE domain is reduced by $3.5\text{-}9\times$.},

A four-level balanced coding is used in this work to minimize the simultaneous switching noise at TX, to utilize a differential sensing without a reference voltage at RX, to maintain the pin efficiency of 100%, and also to reduce EMI by setting the sum of currents through the four wires to be zero. A capacitive pre-emphasis scheme modified for four-level signaling is also used at TX to compensate for inter-symbol interference. The transmitted four-level signals are recovered by six differential comparators with an offset compensation and a decoder at RX.

A new analysis of the theoretical minimum start-up time provides a new criterion for evaluating the start-up time in crystal oscillators. The calculated theoretical minimum start-up time at 39.25 MHz is 11.1 μs. Anew analysis of the proposed CI and NRB clarifies the validity of the universal optimum control method. It explains the reason why the proposed CI and NRB reduce the start-up time and its variation. The proposed crystal oscillator with the proposed CI and NRB exhibits a startup time of 158 μs at 39.25 MHz. The variation of the start-up time variations is ±13% over the supply voltage range of 1.2-1.8 V and ±7% over the temperature range of -30 to 125 °C. The power consumption of the crystal oscillator in the steady state is 181 μW with a phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset frequency, which corresponds to a figure of merit (FoM) of 276 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a 50 nW wirelessly powered implant for the noninvasive monitoring of a bioartificial pancreas postimplantation in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) animal studies. The proposed implant increases NMR signal sensitivity across a 190-470 MHz frequency range in both 4.7 and 11.1 T magnetic fields through the use of a wirelessly programmable resonator. An integrated split capacitive array provides 51.8 pF tuning range and 52 fF resolution while maintaining resonant Q and reducing parasitic contributions. The implant supports forward data telemetry at 5-250 kbit/s using an envelope detector front-end and a 2.4 MHz oversampling clock/data recovery (CDR) receiver. An integrated logic-controlled RF-DC converter and strongly coupled resonant wireless link provide sustained reliable energy transfer during NMR acquisition. NMR signal isolation from the wireless power transmissions is achieved through frequency allocation and orthogonally embedded coil design that provides increased mechanical strength for incorporating device components. Experimental results in tissue-equivalent gel phantoms and small animal studies show an increase in acquired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 141% (7.7 dB) and 83% (5.3 dB) within 4.7 and 11.1 T magnetic field strengths, respectively, with an approximate 100% (6 dB) increase in SNR within the region of interest (ROI) at higher image resolutions.},

abstract={On complex system-on-chips (SOCs), a compact on-die analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required in high-volume testing, in order to reduce the test time and improve the test coverage of on-die analog intellectual properties (IPs). This paper presents a compact first-order ΣΔ modulator for on-die voltage measurements in such applications. The primary design focus is to achieve a highly compact area so that many instances can be integrated to cover the testing of multiple analog IPs on a single chip die. The proposed modulator deploys an inverter-based architecture which enables the aggressive area reduction. There are two new additional enhancements: 1) hardware dithering to minimize the limit-cycling effect and 2) time-multiplexed pseudodifferential operation for common mode rejection. The modulator exhibits a figure of merit (FOM) of 554.7 fJ/conv-step, in spite of the compact area of only 0.00023 mm2.},

abstract={A low-power object recognition (OR) system with intuitive gaze user interface (UI) is proposed for battery-powered smart glasses. For low-power gaze UI, we propose a low-power single-chip gaze estimation sensor, called gaze image sensor (GIS). In GIS, a novel column-parallel pupil edge detection circuit (PEDC) with new pupil edge detection algorithm XY pupil detection (XY-PD) is proposed which results in 2.9× power reduction with 16× larger resolution compared to previous work. Also, a logarithmic SIMD processor is proposed for robust pupil center estimation, (1 pixel error, with low-power floating-point implementation. For OR, low-power multicore OR processor (ORP) is implemented. In ORP, task-level pipeline with keypoint-level scoring is proposed to reduce the number of cores as well as the operating frequency of keypoint-matching processor (KMP) for low-power consumption. Also, dual-mode convolutional neural network processor (CNNP) is designed for fast tile selection without external memory accesses. In addition, a pipelined descriptor generation processor (DGP) with LUT-based nonlinear operation is newly proposed for low-power OR. Lastly, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for dynamic power reduction in ORP is applied. Combining both of the GIS and ORP fabricated in 65 nm CMOS logic process, only 75 mW average power consumption is achieved with real-time OR performance, which is 1.2× and 4.4× lower power than the previously published work.},

abstract={This work examines the use of a forward body biasing (FBB) scheme to mitigate output conductance degradation due to short channel effects in ultra-low voltage (ULV) circuits with no additional power consumption. It is shown that FBB boosts the output resistance of a transistor such that the intrinsic gain reduction due to low-supply voltages can be compensated. This technique is then used to implement a low-noise amplifier (LNA) tailored for ultra-low power (ULP) and ULV applications. The proposed LNA uses common-gate (CG) NMOS transistors as input devices in a complementary current-reuse structure. Low-power input matching is achieved by employing an active shunt-feedback architecture while the current of the feedback stage is also reused by the input transistor. Moreover, a separate FBB scheme is exploited to tune the feedback coefficient. An inductive gm-boosting technique is used to increase the bandwidth of the LNA without additional power consumption. The proposed LNA is implemented in an IBM 0.13 μm 1P8M CMOS technology and occupies 0.39 mm2. The measured LNA has a 14 dB gain, 4 dB minimum noise figure, IIP3 of -10 dBm, and 0.6-4.2 GHz bandwidth, while consuming only 500 μA from a 0.5 V supply. The LNA operates with supplies as low as 0.4 V while maintaining good performance.},

abstract={A pulsed ultrawideband (UWB) transceiver with four-element receiver beamforming is described. Multiband signaling with frequency hopping is employed to efficiently utilize spectrum from 6 to 8.5 GHz to achieve a high data rate of 1 Gbps. A pulse-based signaling approach with low implementation complexity is utilized. Frequency-hopping reduces the overhead for multiband implementation by sharing multiple circuit blocks in the transmitter and receiver paths. The sinusoids for pulse-shaping and single-sideband mixing are synthesized using multiphase LOs to avoid high-speed DACs. The receiver channelizes the spectrum with cascaded mixers for which the LO signals are derived from a single PLL. A single-input multi-output (SIMO) beamforming architecture is employed to increase the sensitivity of the receiver. Beamforming is performed at baseband to avoid the requirement for a wideband delay circuit. The prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS and meets the ECC mask. The measured power dissipation of the transmitter is 221 mW, while that of the receiver is 211 mW. A receiver sensitivity of -69 dBm is achieved and Gbps communication over 2 m is demonstrated.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2463-2474}, 
abstract={This paper reports a readout circuit for a resistive CO2 sensor, which operates by measuring the CO2-dependent thermal conductivity of air. A suspended hot-wire transducer, which acts both as a resistive heater and temperature sensor, exhibits a CO2-dependent heat loss to the surrounding air, allowing CO2 concentration to be derived from its temperature rise and power dissipation. The circuit employs a dual-mode incremental delta-sigma ADC to digitize these parameters relative to those of an identical, but isolated, reference transducer. This ratiometric approach results in a measurement that does not require precision voltage or power references. The readout circuit uses dynamically-swapped transducer pairs to cancel their baseline-resistance, so as to relax the required dynamic range of the ADC. In addition, dynamic element matching (DEM) is used to bias the transducer pairs at an accurate current ratio, making the measurement insensitive to the precise value of the bias current. The readout circuit has been implemented in a standard 0.16 μm CMOS technology. With commercial resistive micro-heaters, a CO2 sensing resolution of about 200 ppm (1σ) was achieved in a measurement time of 30 s. Similar results were obtained with CMOS-compatible tungsten-wire transducers, paving the way for fully-integrated CO2 sensors for air-quality monitoring.},

Compared to the prior art, our chip makes possible arbitrary nonlinearities and achieves 16× lower power dissipation, thanks to technology scaling and extensive use of class-AB analog blocks. Typically, the unit achieves a computational accuracy of about 0.5% to 5% RMS, solution times from a fraction of 1 μs to several hundred μs, and total computational energy from a fraction of 1 nJ to hundreds of nJ, depending on equation details. Very significant advantages are observed in computational speed and energy (over two orders of magnitude and over one order of magnitude, respectively) compared to those obtained with a modern microcontroller for the same RMS error.},

pages={1125-1140}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated 60 GHz directconversion transceiver in 45 nm SOI CMOS for same-channel full-duplex (FD) wireless communication. FD operation is enabled by a novel polarization-based wideband reconfigurable selfinterference cancellation (SIC) technique in the antenna domain. The antenna cancellation can be reconfigured from the IC to combat the variable SI scattering from the environment during in-field operation. A second RF cancellation path with> 30 dB gain control and> 360° phase control from the transmitter (TX) output to the LNA output further suppresses the residual SI to achieve the high levels of required SIC. With antenna and RF cancellation together, a total SI suppression of > 70 dB is achieved over a cancellation bandwidth of 1 GHz and can be maintained in the presence of nearby reflectors. In conjunction with digital SIC (DSIC) implemented in MATLAB, a FD link is demonstrated over 0.7 m with a signal-to-interference-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINDR) of 7.2 dB. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the highest integration level among FD transceivers irrespective of the operation frequency and demonstrates the first fully integrated mm-wave FD transceiver front-end and link.},

abstract={Piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters have been widely researched and are increasingly employed for powering wireless sensor nodes. The synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) circuit is one of the most efficient interfaces for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters. However, the traditional incarnation of this circuit suffers from a significant startup issue that limits operation in low and variable amplitude vibration environments. This paper addresses this start-up issue for the SSHI rectifier by proposing a new architecture with SSHI startup circuitry. The startup circuitry monitors if the SSHI circuit is operating correctly and re-starts the SSHI interface if required. The proposed circuit is comprehensively analyzed and experimentally validated through tests conducted by integrating a commercial piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with the new interface circuit designed in a 0.35-μm HV CMOS process. Compared to conventional SSHI rectifiers, the proposed circuit significantly decreases the required minimum input excitation amplitude before energy can be harvested, making it possible to extract energy over an increased excitation range.},

abstract={With the help of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, a portable micro gas chromatography (μGC) system for lung cancer associated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection is realized for the first time.

year={2016},

pages={1168-1176}, 
abstract={We propose an ADC-digital codesign approach to IF sampling digital beamforming (DBF) that combines continuous-time bandpass ΔΣ modulators (CTBPDSMs) and bit-stream processing (BSP). This approach enables power-and area-efficient DBF by removing the need for digital multipliers and multiple decimators. The prototype beamformer digitizes eight 260 MHz IF signals at 1040 MS/s with eight CTBPDSMs, and performs digital down conversion and phase shifting with only multiplexers directly on the undecimated CTBPDSM outputs. With two sets of phase shifters, the prototype simultaneously forms two independent beams. Each phase shifter is controlled by a 12 bit programmable complex weight to provide a total of 240 phase-shift steps. By constructively combining inputs from eight elements, an 8.9 dB SNDR improvement is achieved, resulting in an array SNDR of 63.3 dB over a 10 MHz bandwidth. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the eight-element two-beam prototype beamformer is the first IC implementation of IF sampling DBF. It occupies 0.28 mm2, and consumes 123.7 mW.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-power low-noise 60 GHz frequency synthesizer using a 20 GHz subsampling phase-locked loop (SS-PLL) and a 60 GHz tail-coupling quadrature injection-locked oscillator (QILO) which results in a lower in-band phase noise and out-of-band phase noise, respectively. To save battery life, dual-step-mixing injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) enhances locking range for high division ratio. Moreover, tail cross-coupling technique in a QILO helps boost negative transconductance (-gm) of the 60 GHz QILO which allows the use of larger inductance for power reduction. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, it can cover required channels from 58.32 to 64.80 GHz with quadrature outputs. It consumes 24.2 and 7.8 mW from 20 GHz SS-PLL and QILO, respectively. The proposed synthesizer achieves -78.5; dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, -122 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset, and a figure-of-merit (FoM) of -236 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents an all-digital class-G quadrature switched-capacitor power amplifier (Q-SCPA) implemented in 65 nm CMOS. It combines in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals on a shared capacitor array. The I/Q signals are digitally weighted and combined in the charge domain. Quadrature summation results in a 3 dB signal loss; Hence the Q-SCPA utilizes a class-G dual-supply architecture to improve efficiency at backoff. Unlike polar/EER counterparts, the Q-SCPA requires no wideband phase modulator or delay matching circuitry. The Q-SCPA delivers a peak output power of 20.5 dBm with a peak PAE of 20%. It is measured with a 10 MHz, 64 QAM LTE signal, and achieves an ACLR of <;-30 dBc, with an EVM <; 4%-rms.},

volume={51},

pages={79-91}, 
abstract={The SPARC M7 processor offers up to 3 × the throughput performance of Oracle's previous SPARC processor generation for many enterprise workloads. It contains 32 highly optimized S4 cores that include a more efficient L2 cache scheme, support for VIS extensions, virtual address masking, and user-level synchronization instructions to provide substantial single thread performance over the predecessor design. A total of 256 threads per chip provide the throughput performance required by even the most demanding enterprise applications. Both throughput and single thread performance benefit from a large fully shared 64 MB on-chip L3 cache with very low latency. The 0.5 TB/s on-chip communications bandwidth requirements are served via a semi-custom on-chip network (OCN) in place of the traditional crossbar. Hardware database analytics accelerator units (DAX) achieve up to 10 × the performance for in-memory database queries, include decompression and messaging operations, and support pointer version checking for securing application data through application data integrity (ADI), as well as fine grained memory migration. The SerDes IO operate up to 18 Gbps, offering 1 TB/s total bandwidth for memory and multi-socket interfaces. New on-chip power management features include fast and accurate dynamic power meters, thermal sensors, and a fine-grain thermal, current, and chip power control engine to enable maximum performance/Watt. Special circuits like the voltage shift module (VSM) were developed to cope with the clock and voltage domain crossing issues, while the asymmetric frequency lock loop (AFLL) main clock generation circuit also provides Ldi/dt droop compensation leading to substantial power savings.},

abstract={Two distributed circuits based on MOS-HBT cascodes are reported in a 55-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology and are aimed at a single-chip time-interleaved transceiver for future 1-Tb/s optical links. The first, a DC-135-GHz single-ended distributed amplifier (DA) was optimized for low noise, linear receivers, and has a measured noise figure (NF) <;7 dB up to 88.5 GHz, 800 mVpp of linear input range, and 8.5 dB gain. Operation was confirmed with PRBS-31 eye diagram measurements up to 120 Gb/s. Additionally, a novel time-interleaved distributed power DAC test circuit was implemented as a proof-of-concept to investigate the maximum achievable output bandwidth at a differential output voltage swing of 6 Vpp, as needed to directly drive an optical modulator. Simulations of the doubly segmented 6-bit DAC show 4-PAM output eye diagrams at up to 120 GBaud. The measured clock-input-to-data-output small-signal bandwidth is 65 GHz. When the DAC is measured as a switching large-swing driver, the differential output voltage swing remains larger than 5.4 Vpp beyond 50 Gb/s. Time interleaving of 4 thermometer MSBs is demonstrated experimentally to form a 1.8-Vpp differential, 10-GBaud 3-PAM output signal. The experimental sampling rate is limited to 10 GS/s by the capacitance and bandwidth of the low-frequency probes and pads used for the data lanes.},

abstract={A polar transmitter (TX) is implemented at 60 GHz, enabling a power amplifier (PA) to operate in saturation where efficiency is highest, even when handling higher order modulations such as QPSK and 16-QAM. The phase path is upconverted by I-Q mixers, while the amplitude path modulates an RF-DAC. Aimed at 802.11ad applications, the 10 GS/s (i.e., 6x-oversampled) polar TX realizes more than 30 dB alias attenuation, and the input bandwidth exceeds 3.1 GHz. The PA saturated output power is 10.8 dBm with 29.8% drain efficiency at the maximum RF-DAC code. Average output power is 8.1 dBm with 22.3% drain efficiency at -20.7 dB EVM for QPSK modulation without RF-DAC predistortion. The corresponding 16-QAM values are: 7.2 dBm average output power with 19.8% efficiency at -16.5 dB EVM. With predistortion, a QPSK modulated output achieves 5.3 dBm average power with 15.3% efficiency at -23.6 dB EVM, while 3.6 dBm average power with 11.6% efficiency at -18.1 dB EVM is realized for 16-QAM. For a sampling rate of 10 GS/s, the TX data rates are 3.33 Gb/and 6.67 Gb/s for QPSK and 16-QAM, respectively. Implemented in 40 nm bulk-CMOS, the core circuit occupies 0.18 mm2 core of the 2.38 mm2 total die area, and consumes 40.2 mW from a 0.9 V supply.},

abstract={We present a near-field radio system for a millimeter-scale wireless smart sensor node that is implantable through a 14-gauge syringe needle. The proposed system integrates a radio system on chip and a magnetic antenna on a glass substrate within a total dimension of 1 × 1 × 10 mm3. We demonstrate energy-efficient active near-field wireless communication between the millimeter-scale sensor node and a base station device through an RF energy-absorbing tissue. The wireless transceiver, digital baseband controller, wakeup controller, on-chip baseband timer, sleep timer, and MBUS controller are all integrated on the SoC to form a millimeter-scale sensor node, together with a 1 × 8 mm2 magnetic antenna fabricated with a 1.5-μm-thickness gold on a 100 μm-thickness glass substrate. An asymmetric link is established pairing the sensor antenna with a codesigned 11 × 11 cm2 base station antenna to achieve a link distance of up to 50 cm for sensor transmission and 20 cm for sensor reception. The transmitter consumes a 43.5 μW average power at 2 kb/s, while the receiver power consumption is 36 μW with a -54 dBm sensitivity at 100 kb/s. When powered by a 1×2.2 mm2 thin-film battery (2 μAh, 4.1 V), the designed system has a two week expected lifetime without battery recharging when the system wakes up and transmits and receives 16 b data every 10 min.},

abstract={A completely integrated 3.3 V to 10 Vpk-pk bidirectional switched-capacitor ladder converter is presented for driving the piezo actuators of a 2 mm wing micro-robotic flying insect. The 0.1-10 MHz converter, fabricated in 1.2 V/3.3 V triple-well 0.13 μm CMOS, operates as a switched-mode amplifier with 0-3.3 V waveforms at the input and a constant 3× step-up while exhibiting symmetric drive strength for positive and negative load currents. A feedforward switching scheme that effectively bootstraps gate-drive signals for the power switches of the ladder converter has been implemented to enable output waveforms above both the supply and device voltage rating, between 0 V and ~10 V. Nonoverlapping clock signals float with the dc-500 Hz arbitrary input waveform, or a 2× scaled replica, while keeping all transistors within safe operating conditions. A voltage compliant sub-circuit, the Nested-Bootstrapped Switch (NBS) cell, is introduced as a building block for the creation of the gate-drive signals. On-chip MIM capacitors and 3.3 V I/O MOS switches for the ladder converter were sized based on a charge-multiplier representation of the converter and the output impedance concept. Experiments show actuation of a 2 mm wing prototype, an effective 5 nF peak load, and efficiency of 77% at 800 μW and 80% at 32 μW.},

abstract={A four-channel multi-input multi-output (MIMO) complex baseband receiver for spectrum and space-aware cognitive radio applications is presented. The MIMO baseband receiver comprises a capacitive harmonic-rejection downconverting mixer (HRM) receiver and a signal-separation multi-input multi-output analog core (MAC) on a single integrated circuit. The HRM receiver performs frequency selection of the incoming RF signals by programmable spectral downconversion and filtering with minimal harmonic folding. The subsequent MAC separates the spectrally overlapping but spatially diverse signals by weighted complex matrix multiplication. The entire signal path is implemented using energy-efficient gm-C analog circuits with digitally controlled capacitive weighting for configurable baseband down-/upconversion ranging from -24 to +24 MHz in the HRM, and programmable spatial filtering with 4×4 complex (8×8 real) 14-bit coefficients in the MAC. Measurements demonstrate greater than 65 dB harmonic-folding rejection by the HRM, and greater than 48.5 dB spatial signal separation by the MAC. The 65 nm CMOS IC occupies 3.27 mm2 active area, and consumes 480 μW digital power at 45 MHz LO and 840 μW analog power at 3 MHz baseband from a 1.2 V supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a digital bang-bang phase-locked loop (DBPLL) that employs automatic loop gain control and loop latency reduction techniques to enhance the jitter performance. Due to noise filtering properties, a DBPLL has an optimal loop gain which gives rise to the best jitter performance, taking into account external and internal noise sources. By using the automatic loop gain control technique, the DBPLL can automatically attain this loop gain in background to minimize the jitter. This paper also exploits time-series analysis to analyze the DBPLL. In particular, the closed-form gain of a bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) is first derived, taking into account reference clock noise and oscillator noise simultaneously. The chip was fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process. This DBPLL achieves <; 290 fs integrated rms jitter and <;- 72.89 dBc reference spurs.

year={2016},

number={8}, 
pages={1810-1825}, 
abstract={A wide-input-range DC-DC-based dimmable LED driver is presented in this paper. The proposed LED driver can be automatically configured to operate in the soft-switching mode under the high-voltage condition in order to minimize the converter's dominant switching power loss. Adaptive resonant timing control is developed to enable proper dead-time generation for on-chip high-voltage power FETs in both hard- and soft-switching modes under different input and output voltages for the power loss minimization. In the proposed LED driver, two low-power body-diode-based zero-voltage detectors and an adaptive resonant timing emulator are also proposed for providing accurate and high-speed zero-voltage switching (ZVS) detection of both power FETs, and achieving optimal quasi-ZVS condition, respectively. Implemented in a 0.5 μm HV CMOS process, the proposed buck-based LED driver can support an input voltage range from 5 V to 115 V and up to 25 series-connected highbrightness LEDs with the maximum output power of 25 W. The LED driver can operate up to 1.6 MHz in the soft-switching mode and 2.2 MHz in the hard-switching mode for providing the peak power efficiencies of 94.4% and 93.6%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, this work is the only integrated DC-DC-based dimmable LED driver to demonstrate auto-configurable hard- and soft-switching capability achieving high power efficiency and current accuracy over the widest input voltage range and the largest number of series-connected output LEDs.},

abstract={A 12-bit 104 MS/s successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) is developed for a digitally-assisted wireless transmitter system for use in cellular applications. A power-on calibration method is implemented to correct capacitor DAC mismatch and reduce capacitor size, thereby lowering the current consumption of the input buffer and reference generator. The total capacitor size is reduced to 0.6 pF, from the 3.6 pF required for 12-bit matching. The ADC analog core area is 0.003 mm2. The proposed method achieves 88 dB SFDR at 26 MHz sampling rate and 76.2 dB SFDR at 104 MHz sampling rate after calibration. The measured DNL and INL are 0.5 LSB and 1.1 LSB, respectively. The ADC achieves both high speed and low power by combining several features, namely digital calibration, redundancy, asynchronous bit-cycling, monotonic switching, 25% duty-cycle sampling period, 3 dB input gain, and a fully dynamic comparator. The power consumption from 1.2 V/1.1 V supplies is 0.88 mW for a single ADC core and 6.1 mW for the entire I/Q ADC, including the reference generator and input buffers.

title={A Column-Row-Parallel ASIC Architecture for 3-D Portable Medical Ultrasonic Imaging}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={3}, 
pages={738-751}, 
abstract={This paper presents a scalable column-row-parallel ASIC architecture for 3-D portable medical ultrasound. Through its programmable row-by-row or column-by-column operations for both transmit and receive beam-formation, linear scaling in interconnection, data acquisition complexity, power dissipation, and programming time is achieved. In addition, its per-element controllers can activate fine granularity aperture definition when more functionality is favored over the linear-scaling power and speed efficiency. This front-end architecture is backward compatible to implement existing widely used array aperture patterns, while supporting new imaging apertures and algorithms. It lends itself very well for the combination with integrated or external digital beamforming circuits. A 16 × 16 proof-of-concept ASIC is fabricated and flip-chip bonded to a 16 × 16 capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT). Each three-level pulsing transmitter (Tx) is 46% more power efficient than a traditional two-level version, with high-voltage (HV) multiplexers (MUXs) designed for flexible Tx parallelization. Each low-noise receiver (Rx) consumes 1.4 mW active power and 54 μW sleep power, with optimized source follower stages to combine analog outputs for improved SNR. The transceivers are also fault-tolerant to inevitable defects in transducers, greatly enhancing assembly yield. The system demonstrates 3-D plane-wave generation to implement the coherent compounding algorithm for fast volume rate (62.5 volume/s), high-quality 3-D ultrasonic imaging. An interleaved checker board pattern with Iand Q excitations is also demonstrated for ultrasonic harmonic imaging, which reduces transmitted second harmonic distortion (HD2) by over 20 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a technique for designing an ultra-compact and robust physically unclonable function for security-oriented applications. The circuits are based on pairs of analog circuits whose output voltage is supply voltage compensated and proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). The difference between two outputs of a PTAT pair is digitized to produce 1 b output which is sensitive mostly only to random transistor threshold voltage variations. Fabricated in a 65 nm, the proposed 256 b PUF array takes an area of 3.07 μm2/bit, consumes 0.548 pJ/bit at a throughput of 10 Mb/s, while showing desirable robustness against temperature and supply voltage variations with 3.5% and 1.004% bit-instability across 0 to 80°C and 0.6 to 1.2 V, respectively. The unpredictability and uniqueness of the 256 b PUF output are verified by NIST randomness test and Hamming Distance between keys. As compared with the state of the art, the proposed design has an 8.3× smaller area/bit or 2× better robustness against noise and environmental variations.},

abstract={This paper presents a 9-bit 1.8 GS/s pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using open-loop amplifiers. In this ADC, open-loop amplifiers are used as residue amplifiers to increase the sampling rate of the ADC with relatively low power consumption. A linearization technique is proposed to suppress the SNDR decrease caused by the nonlinearity of open-loop amplifiers. The attenuation in the capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is utilized to calibrate the gain error of the pipelined stages. In addition, top-plate sampling is proposed to further enhance the power efficiency of the residue amplifiers. With these techniques, the ADC achieves a high sampling rate and high power efficiency. A prototype of the ADC is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology. An SNDR of 47 dB and a FoM of 134 fJ/conversion-step is achieved at a sampling rate of 1.8 GS/s with 900 MHz input, while consuming 44 mW from a 1.2 V supply.},

abstract={A capacitively-coupled laser diode driver (LDD) for common-cathode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) designed in 65 nm CMOS intended for short-reach parallel optical interconnects is presented. The LDD consists of a capacitively-coupled voltage-mode high-frequency path and a direct-coupled path that provides low-frequency signal components. By increasing the low-frequency path bandwidth an order of magnitude compared to previous capacitively-coupled drivers, the on-chip coupling capacitor is reduced to 1.05 pF, occupying 3 times less area than prior art. The driver incorporates capacitively-coupled two-tap pre-emphasis to equalize the VCSEL's optical response. The VCSEL was modulated with an optical modulation amplitude (OMA) of up to +5.1 dBm and an extinction ratio of 9 dB at 15 Gb/s, the highest extinction ratio achieved in high-speed anode-driving CMOS LDDs. The driver is programmable and is also demonstrated with +2.3 dBm OMA at a power consumption of only 30 mW, corresponding to an energy efficiency of 2 pJ/bit.},

abstract={As technology scales, integrating high resolution ADCs into high fidelity mixed signal systems becomes challenging in advanced CMOS processes. Cascading integrators to achieve high-order filter structures limits the modulation index and compromises on stability at the expense of added hardware and power consumption. To optimize the maximum stable amplitude (MSA) to accommodate a larger input dynamic range, the supply rails have to be expanded, which limited technology choices to those of a larger feature size. This work proposes a 25 kHz 3rd-order continuous-time ΔΣ modulator (CTΔΣM) utilizing a 5-bit SAR quantizer, enabling noise coupling (NC) to be possible in a typical nanoscale CMOS 65 nm technology with VDD of 1 V. Mismatches in SAR comparator and DAC array are mitigated with a proposed calibration scheme while CM mismatches are solved by a floating differential charge storage capacitor (FDCSC) coupling method. To allow sufficient time for SAR bit cycling and noise charge feedback settling, 1 Ts excess loop delay (ELD) is compensated with digital differentiation that minimizes both the power and complexity of the auxiliary feedback DAC. The prototype obtained DR/SNR/SNDR of 103.1 dB/100.1 dB/95.2 dB while dissipating 0.8 mW, hence achieving a FoMSNDR and FoMschreier of 0.34 pJ/level and 177.9 dB, respectively.},

volume={51},

pages={1188-1199}, 
abstract={A digitally intensive transmitter using RF pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) with a class-D power amplifier (PA) is described. The use of carrier switching for alleviating the dynamic range limitation that can be observed in classical RF-PWM implementations is introduced. The approach employs full carrier frequency for half of the amplitude range and the second harmonic of half of the carrier frequency, for the remainder of the amplitude range. This concept not only allows the transmitter to drive modulated signals with large peak-to-average power ratios (PAPR) but also improves back-off efficiency due to reduced switching losses in the half carrier-frequency mode. A glitch-free phase selector is proposed that removes the deleterious glitches that can occur at the input data transitions. The phase-selector also prevents D flip-flop setup-and-hold time violations. The transmitter has been implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process. The measured peak output power and power-added-efficiency (PAE) are 25.6 dBm and 34%, respectively. While driving 802.11g 20 MHz 64-QAM OFDM signals, the average output power is 18.3 dBm and the PAE is 16% with an EVM of -25.5 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a miniaturized wide-input-range integrated reconfigurable three-level dc-dc voltage regulator. A three-level buck converter topology with zerovoltage switching (ZVS) is adopted to remove the dominant switching power loss under high-input-voltage condition, thereby enabling the converter to achieve high power efficiency in the megahertz range and reduce the required values of power passives. A constant-frequency adaptive-on-time V2 control is proposed to not only regulate the output voltage, but also offer the flying capacitor self-balancing in the megahertz range and over a wide input range for improving the converter reliability. A body diode-based floating ZVS detector is also developed to enable full-ZVS operation of power transistors in high-frequency low duty-ratio conditions with ≤5 ns ZVS turnon delay. Implemented in a 120 V 0.5 μm CMOS process, the proposed voltage regulator uses four 50 V on-chip power nMOS to support an input voltage from 12 to 100 V and regulates the output voltage at 10 V with a maximum output power of 5 W. The proposed regulator achieves a maximum power efficiency of 90% under the nominal 48 V input and 2 MHz switching frequency. Compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed regulator provides 66 times and 2.6 times reductions in the inductance and the total capacitance, respectively.},

abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time (CT) multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) ADC in 28 nm CMOS. The MASH ADC uses a first-order front-end stage to digitize the input signal and a second-order back-end stage to digitize the quantization noise of the coarse flash ADC inside the front-end. An RC lattice filter and a current-steering DAC are utilized to extract the front-end coarse quantization residue. The prototype MASH ADC chip built in a 28 nm CMOS process is clocked at 8 GHz with an OSR of 8.6, providing a signal bandwidth of 465 MHz. The ADC achieves a DR of 72 dB and an average small-signal NSD of -160 dBFS/Hz. The peak SNR is 68 dB and the peak SNDR is 67 dB. The IM3 is -88 dBFS with two -9 dBFS tones at the band edge. The ADC consumes 890 mW of power from +1.8/1.0/-1.0 V supplies and achieves a thermal noise FOM of 159 dB.},

title={Mitigation of Oscillator Pulling in SoCs},

pages={348-356}, 
abstract={This paper presents a novel method to mitigate undesirable oscillator pulling effects in wireless transmitter architectures. In practice, coupling of the power amplifier (PA) signal caused by inductive or electromagnetic crosstalk, inevitably leads to injection pulling. Particularly, for nonconstant envelope modulation schemes such as Bluetooth enhanced data rate (EDR), GSM-EDGE, or WiFi, the pulling is extremely troublesome due to the amplitude-to-frequency (AM-FM) conversion effect. The difficulty to cope with this undesirable effect stems from the fact that the pulling is largely dependent on process spread and environmental factors like temperature and antenna load mismatch. This paper proposes a novel method based on stochastic-gradient algorithms to resolve the pulling effect. It can be realized inexpensively in digital design and does not rely on knowledge of the unpredictable crosstalk path which makes it extremely efficient to mitigate the pulling effect. To verify the novel idea, a prototype IC has been fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology.},

title={A Fractional-N Counter-Assisted DPLL With Parallel Sampling ILFD}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1361-1373}, 
abstract={A fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) with ring oscillator based injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) and parallel sampling phase samplers is presented. The ILFD utilizes dual path injection technique to achieve wide locking range (4.2-23 GHz) and low power consumption. A low-power parallel sampling phase sampler based time-to-digital converter (TDC), which achieves sub-gate-delay resolution by sampling the ILFD's multi-phase outputs using parallel sampling technique, is proposed. The TDC resolution is determined by delay spacing between successive sampling clocks, which is ensured through digital calibration loops. Due to injection locking, no calibration is required to normalize the TDC step to the DCO output period. A hybrid high speed counter architecture, combining a 2 bit asynchronous counter and a 6 bit synchronous counter, is proposed to achieve high speed (>4 GHz) operation with low power consumption. The proposed design is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and occupies 0.1 mm2. The synthesizer covers 13.6-16.8 GHz output and dissipates 8.5 mW. The measured output phase noise achieves -89 dBc/Hz and -125 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz and 10 MHz offsets, respectively. The measured jitter is less than 0.43 ps.},

title={An Analog Front-End for a Multifunction Sensor Employing a Weak-Inversion Biasing Technique With 26 nVrms, 25 aCrms, and 19 fArms Input-Referred Noise},

abstract={An analog front-end (AFE) for a multifunction environmental sensor is proposed. The AFE is designed to be able to sense 1 μV, 1 fC, and 1 pA level signals in a low-frequency band around DC, and consists of an instrumentation amplifier (IA), a charge amplifier (CA), and a continuous time delta-sigma (CTΔΣ) ADC. To reduce the low-frequency noise of operational amplifier (OPAMP) which is used for signal path, this paper proposes a weak-inversion biasing technique. The designed IA achieved 26 nVrms input-referred noise (IRN) in the band of 0.1-10 Hz with 0.22 mm2 die area. The designed CA achieved 25 aCrms IRN in charge sensing mode and 19 fArms IRN in current sensing mode in the band of 0.01-1 Hz, respectively, and occupies 0.12 mm2 die area. The AFE has been fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process with 4.5 mm2 die area. The current consumption at 2.56 kHz output data rate (ODR) is 2.5 mA, reducing to 2 μA at 0.01 Hz ODR.},

year={2016},

number={2}, 
pages={365-377}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 4× time-interleaved 6-bit 5 GS/s 3 b/cycle SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Hardware overhead induced by a 3 b/cycle architecture is eased by an interpolation technique where around 1/3 of the hardware is saved. In addition, complicated switching controls are simplified with a proposed fractional DAC array switching scheme, thus reducing the design complexity and the hardware burden. A boundary detection code overriding (BDCO) is introduced to reduce error probability at the large error magnitude, by utilizing the extended time when the comparator is at reset and the DAC at settling. The floorplan of the front-end is optimized for important interleaving clock distributions, and a master-clock-control bootstrapped-switch technique is adopted to suppress the timing-skew effect among the channels. The unit capacitor has been designed to suit for the DAC structure which allows top-plate sharing in both directions, plus, the offset is calibrated on-chip with a clocking variable biasing transistor pair at the latch. Measurement results show that the prototype can achieve 5 GS/s with a total power consumption of 5.5 mW at 1 V supply in 65 nm CMOS technology. Besides, it exhibits a 30.76 dB SNDR and 43.12 dB SFDR at Nyquist, which yields a Walden FoM of 39 fJ/conversion-step.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51},

pages={2928-2940}, 
abstract={The successive-approximation-register (SAR) architecture is well known for its high power efficiency in medium-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). However, when considered for high-precision applications, SAR ADCs suffer from non-linearity resulting from capacitor mismatch and limited dynamic range due to comparator noise. This work presents a mismatch error shaping (MES) technique for oversampling SAR ADCs to achieve 105 dB in-band SFDR without calibration. The capacitor mismatch error is first-order high-pass filtered by simply delaying the reset of LSB capacitor array after sampling. The comparator thermal and flicker noise are also first-order shaped to high frequencies by noise shaping. The prototype in 55 nm CMOS occupies 0.072 mm2 and achieves a peak SNDR of 101 dB over 1 kHz bandwidth. It consumes 15.7 μW from a 1.2 V supply at 1 MS/s and can be configured to Nyquist mode up to 5 MS/s. These features enable the application of SAR ADCs in high-precision, multi-purpose sensor readout interfaces.},

abstract={This paper presents an asynchronous SAR-assisted time-interleaved SAR (SATI-SAR) ADC as a suitable architecture in a low-supply-voltage condition. Settling-While-Conversion enabled by the Assist-ADC relaxes the DAC settling time requirement and makes it possible to insert a minimized capacitor shuffling logic with no speed penalty. A proposed gain-boosting dynamic pre-amplifier enhances the noise performance of the comparator and a self time-reference generation function is embedded in the pre-amplifier for a speed-enhanced asynchronous decision. A proposed dual-mode clock generator generates a low-jitter fixed-width sampling pulse for high-frequency operation while it generates a low-power-but-low-quality clock for low-frequency operation. With the dual-mode clock generator enabled, a prototype 65 nm CMOS 0.6 V 12 b 10 MS/s ADC achieves an ENOB of 10.4 at a Nyquist-rate input, and the peaks of DNL and INL are measured to be 0.24 LSB and 0.45 LSB, respectively. The FoM is 6.2 fJ/conversion-step with a power consumption of 83 μW. The ADC operates under the lowest supply voltage of 0.6 V among comparable designs with ENOBs over 10 and conversion rates over 1 MS/s.},

year={2016},

pages={881-892}, 
abstract={This paper presents a quad-lane serial transceiver that supports virtually all data center communication standards around 8.5-13 Gbps, implemented in 28 nm CMOS technology. The transmitter consists of 20:2 mux followed by a half-rate source-series terminated (SST) driver embedded with a 4 tap FFE and an analog equalizer. The receiver has an adaptive CTLE, 5 tap DFE, and fully digital CDR followed by 2:20 demux. At 13 Gbps, the transceiver can equalize 35 dB Nyquist loss at BER of 10-12. At 1.0 V supply, the transceiver consumes 49 mW/lane at 13 Gbps rate with full equalization capability. An LC VCO-based fractional PLL provides the clocking to quad TX/RX lanes using a low-power inductively tuned clock routing channel. The transceiver architecture not only enables the baud rate operation from 8.5 to 13 Gbps but also supports a wide range of oversampled subrates. This work represents the lowest reported power in its class to date, and the transceiver is suitable for many applications due to its comprehensive flexibility and power efficiency.},

abstract={To increase the voltage handling capability of scaled CMOS-based circuits, series connection (stacking) of transistors has been demonstrated in recently reported mm-wave power amplifiers. This paper discusses the implementation of stacked CMOS circuits employing a compact, multigate layout technique, rather than the conventional series connection of individual transistors. A unit multigate FET is composed of a single transistor with one source and drain and multiple (four) gate connections. Capacitances are implemented in a distributed manner allowing close proximity to the individual gate fingers using metal layers available within the CMOS back-end-of-line (BEOL) stack. The multigate structure is demonstrated to decrease parasitic resistances and capacitances, and has better layout for heat-sinking. The unit cell is replicated through tiling to implement larger effective gate widths. Millimeter-wave power amplifiers using the multigate-cell are presented which operate over the 25-35 GHz band and achieve 300 mW of saturated output power and peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 30% in 45 nm CMOS SOI technology. To the authors' knowledge, the output power is the best reported for a single stage CMOS power amplifier that does not use power-combining for this frequency range.},

title={Scalable Spatial Notch Suppression in Spatio-Spectral-Filtering MIMO Receiver Arrays for Digital Beamforming}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3152-3166}, 
abstract={Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output(MIMO) technology is drawing significant interest for the next-generation wireless networks. Traditional MIMO receiver architectures use multiple parallel receiver front ends with digitization at every element to support digital space-time array processing. The absence of analog/RF spatial interference mitigation in traditional digital MIMO receiver arrays results in a high dynamic-range requirement, and consequently, power-hungry analog and RF receiver front ends and analog-to-digital converters. This paper presents a scalable 65 nm CMOS 0.1-1.7 GHz spatio-spectral-filtering four-element MIMO receiver array with spatial notch suppression that protects the analog/RF circuits and analog-to-digital converters from spatial interference early in the signal chain. The combination of spatial and spectral filtering results in more than 19 dB rejection irrespective of the frequency at which the spatial blocker is located. The proposed spatial notch suppression technique improves the measured in-band OIP3 from -10 to +24 dBV, and the measured out-of-band IIP3 from +11 to +18 dBm. Furthermore, turning on the spatial notch suppression leads to minimal noise figure degradation. The proposed chip architecture is scalable on board without the need for RF interconnections. A wireless imaging demo shows two of the implemented integrated circuits tiled on board to form an eight-element MIMO receiver array that is able to detect a weak desired signal in the presence of an in-band 15 dB stronger spatial blocker.},

pages={2299-2311}, 
abstract={A fully-integrated 77 GHz frequency doubling two-path phased-array frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) transceiver for automotive radar applications is proposed. By utilizing the frequency doubling scheme, the chirp bandwidth is improved, and the complexity of the frequency synthesizer and the insertion loss of the local-oscillating (LO) distribution network are both reduced. Top-injected coupled resonator based wide locking range technique is proposed in the frequency doublers to minimize the required injection power to cover the chirp bandwidth plus enough PVT variation margin, and therefore reduce the power consumption of the LO distribution network. Current-reused coupled resonator technique is utilized to implement the LO phase shifting in each receiving path. The digitally controlled artificial dielectric-based transmission lines are inserted in the low noise amplifiers to provide the operation frequency calibration capability. The receiving two-path signals are converted into intermediate frequency by low flicker noise current-mode passive mixers and then combined in the trans-impedance amplifier, followed by the reconfigurable analog baseband processing. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the FMCW transceiver has achieved 1.93 GHz maximum chirp bandwidth, 12.9 ~ 13.2 dBm maximum transmitting power, and 47.8 ~ 100.7 dB programmable receiving conversion gain. The transceiver consumes 343 mW power and 4.64 mm2 chip area including all of the pads.},

pages={2702-2715}, 
abstract={Pushed by the ever-increasing demand of high-speed connectivity, next generation 400 Gb/s electrical links are targeting PAM-4 modulation to limit channel loss and preserve link budget. Compared to NRZ, a higher amplitude is desirable to counteract the 1/3 reduction of PAM-4 vertical eye opening. However, linearity is also key, and PAM-4 levels must be precisely spaced to preserve the horizontal eye opening advantage it has over NRZ. This paper presents a 45 Gb/s PAM-4 transmitter able to deliver a very large output swing with enhanced linearity and state-of-the-art efficiency. Built around a hybrid combination of current-mode and voltage-mode topologies, the driver is embedded into a 4-taps 5-bits feed-forward equalizer (FFE), and allows tuning the output impedance to ensure good source termination. Implemented in 28 nm CMOS FDSOI process, the full transmitter includes a half-rate serializer, duty-cycle correction circuit, >> 2 kV HBM ESD diodes, and delivers a full swing of 1.3 Vppd at 45 Gb/s, while drawing only 120 mA from 1 V supply. The power efficiency is ~ 2 times better than previously reported PAM-4 transmitters.},

abstract={This paper proposes a fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) architecture with feedforward multi-tone spur cancellation scheme. The proposed cancellation loop is capable of suppressing both internal spur, i.e., fractional-N spur, and externally coupled spur from input paths. It can be further extended for multi-stage operation for mitigating multiple spur sources. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided in this paper to explore the design tradeoffs of the proposed technique. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. It measures external spur reduction of 15 to 35 dB and the worst-case fractional spur of 73.66 to 117 dBc with 20-50 dB improvement after enabling the cancellation loop. The measured reference spur ranges from 110.1 to 116.1 dBc across the entire DPLL operation range (3.2-4.8 GHz) thanks to design techniques. The measured in-band phase noise achieves 103 dBc at 100 kHz frequency offset and out-of-band phase noise of 122 dBc at 3 MHz frequency offset with integrated phase noise of 38.1 dBc from 10 kHz to 40 MHz.},

volume={51},

abstract={A non-contact interface for modular smartphones that can provide a data connection at a maximum MIPI rate of 6 Gb/s has been developed. A two-fold transmission line coupler, which is a small-size coupler that has a wide bandwidth, is proposed for modular smartphones, where the layout area is strictly limited. The coupler size is 6 mm2 for a 5 mm communication distance, which is 1/24 smaller than the conventional coupler. Since many wireless communication components, such as LTE, WiFi, and GPS transceivers, are assembled in a small module, the interference between the non-contact interface and the wireless transceivers should be suppressed. To improve noise immunity and reduce unwanted radiation from the coupler, an electromagnetic-compatibility robust pulse transceiver is proposed. A synchronous receiver using an edge counting clock recovery circuit improves noise immunity, and a bi-phase pulse transmitter reduces noise radiation in the GPS band. There is no EMS by LTE or WiFi signals on the data connection at BER <; 10-12 when the coupler is separated by a distance of 2 mm and no EMI on GPS signals at a separation of 10 mm. Compared with the state-of-the-art result, the highest energy efficiency (6 pJ/b) and space efficiency (1.2 mm2/1 mm distance) is achieved.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2389-2397}, 
abstract={A novel method adaptively controls the comparator bias current in a boost converter for sensor-data storage on Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM). ReRAM is ideal for low-power sensors because it is faster and lower voltage than NAND flash. However, ReRAM's voltage design needs to consider program current variation due to data pattern dependency and cell reliability is sensitive to small voltage fluctuations. The proposed control method of the boost converter architecture has three proposals. First, low program voltage ripple (VRIPPLE) and high program energy efficiency is obtained with an adaptive 2 to 8 μA comparator bias-current (ICMP) control method. ICMP is adjusted depending on the number of program bits (NBITS) in the SET data. In 2 cases of NBITS = 1 and 16, and compared to a conventional scheme (ICMP = 8 μA and 2 μA), respectively, VRIPPLE decreases by 41.2% and energy efficiency improves by 6.6%, respectively. Secondly, as NBITS decrease during SET verify, ICMP also decreases, which further reduces SET energy by 8.9 pJ. Thirdly, although the conventional boost converter fails in the `SS' process condition, an additional cross-coupled charge-pump boosts the buffer circuit, which provides full functional operation over the input range of 0.6 to 1.0 V.},

abstract={This work presents a sub-μW on-chip oscillator for fully integrated system-on-chip designs. The proposed oscillator introduces a resistive frequency locked loop topology for accurate clock generation. In this topology, a switched-capacitor circuit is controlled by an internal voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and the equivalent resistance of this switched-capacitor is matched to a temperature-compensated on-chip resistor using an ultra-low power amplifier. This design yields a temperature-compensated frequency from the internal VCO. The approach eliminates the traditional comparator from the oscillation loop; this comparator typically consumes a significant portion of the total oscillator power and limits temperature stability in conventional RC relaxation oscillators due to its temperature-dependent delay. A test chip is fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS that exhibits a temperature coefficient of 34.3 ppm/°C with long-term stability of less than 7 ppm (12 second integration time) while consuming 110 nW at 70.4 kHz. A radio transmitter circuit that uses the proposed oscillator as a baseband timing source is also presented to demonstrate a system-on-chip design using this oscillator.},

abstract={In sub/near-threshold operation, SRAMs suffer from considerable bitline swing degradation when the data pattern of a column is skewed to `1' or `0'. The worst scenarios regarding this problem occur when the currently read SRAM cell has different data compared to the rest of the cells in the same column. In this work, we overcome this challenge by using a column-based randomization engine (CBRE). This CBRE circuit randomizes data stored to SRAM. This makes distribution of “1” and “0” in each column close to 50%, significantly increasing bitline swing. To further improve the bitline swing, we employ bitline boost biasing and dynamic bitline keeper schemes. Based on the mentioned techniques, we fabricated a 256 rows × 128 columns (32 Kb) 8T SRAM array in 65 nm CMOS technology. In our silicon measurement, the SRAM array shows successful 200 mV operation at room temperature, where energy consumption and access time are 1 pJ and 2.5 s, respectively.},

abstract={Multichannel neural amplifiers are commonly implemented with a shared reference whose input impedance is several times lower than that of the corresponding signal inputs. This huge impedance mismatch significantly degrades the total common mode rejection ratio (TCMRR) regardless of the amplifier's intrinsic CMRR (ICMRR). This study reports a multichannel neural amplifier system that eliminates this impedance mismatch problem by using single-ended CMOS-inverter-based preamplifiers for both the reference and signal inputs. A common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop through the supply rails of the preamplifiers is implemented to enhance their ac input common mode range to 220 mVpp and their ICMRR to more than 90 dB at low frequencies. The ICMRR is maintained above 80 dB up to 1 kHz by minimizing the load drive mismatch between the signal and reference preamplifiers. Implemented in a CMOS 65 nm process, this 16-channel amplifier system operates at 1 V and consumes 118 μW. It has input referred noise of 4.13 μVrms, leading to a noise efficiency factor (NEF) and a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 3.19 and 10.17, respectively. In vivo recordings of cortical neurons of a macaque were successfully acquired, demonstrating the ability of the amplifier to acquire neural signals in an unshielded environment.},

pages={979-991}, 
abstract={We present a system for reconstructing-independent voice commands from two simultaneous speakers, based on an array of spatially distributed microphones. It adopts a hybrid architecture, combining large-area electronics (LAE), which enables a physically expansive array (> 1m width), and a CMOS IC, which provides superior transistors for readout and signal processing. The array enables us to: 1) select microphones closest to the speakers to receive the highest SNR signal; 2) use multiple spatially diverse microphones to enhance robustness to variations due to microphones and sound propagation in a practical room. Each channel consists of a thin-film transducer formed from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a piezopolymer, and a localized amplifier composed of amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs). Each channel is sequentially sampled by a TFT scanning circuit, to reduce the number of interfaces between the large-area electronics (LAE) and CMOS IC. A reconstruction algorithm is proposed, which exploits the measured transfer function between each speaker and microphone, to separate two simultaneous speakers. The algorithm overcomes 1) sampling-rate limitations of the scanning circuits and 2) sensitivities to microphone placement and directionality. An entire system with eight channels is demonstrated, acquiring and reconstructing two simultaneous audio signals at 2 m distance from the array achieving a signal-to-interferer (SIR) ratio improvement of ~12 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a hybrid supply modulator (SM) with a comprehensive analysis of receiver (RX) band noise in an envelope tracking power amplifier (ET-PA). The designed SM supports both ET mode and average power tracking (APT) mode depending on the PA output power level. In the APT mode, an integrated buck-boost (BB) converter with hysteretic control generates dc supply voltage and its average switching frequency ranges from 1 to 2 MHz. In the ET mode, the bandwidth of SM is determined by a linear amplifier, which has about 30 MHz of signal bandwidth. To improve the ET efficiency, an ac coupling capacitor, with an adaptive offset control, and scaled linear supply are used. The scaled linear supply is provided by the BB converter. To lower the output noise of the SM, a parallel class-AB output buffer and resonance frequency tuning schemes are applied in this paper. For long term evolution 10 MHz with quadrature phase shift keying modulation and 5.8 dB peak-to-average power ratio, the designed SM achieves 82% efficiency at 800 mW output power with a fixed 8 Ω resistor. Adapting the proposed SM to a PA, a 10 dB ET operation dynamic range is achieved while achieving a power added efficiency of 42.6% at 27 dBm PA output power. The measured SM output noise is -137 dBm/Hz at 95 MHz offset with the PA load, and the PA RX band noise is -124 dBm/Hz, which is dominated by the stand-alone PA itself. The chip is implemented with a 130 nm CMOS process and the die size is 5.0 mm2.},

abstract={This paper presents an ultra-low-voltage and power-efficient 10 bit hybrid successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). For reducing the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) capacitance and comparator requirement, we propose a hybrid architecture comprising a coarse 7 bit SAR ADC and fine 3.5 bit time-to-digital converter (TDC). The Vcm-based switching method is adopted for coarse conversion to reduce DAC power and maintain common mode. The residual voltage after coarse conversion is converted to time domain, and the fine TDC detects the least three bits with 0.5 bit redundancy by using a Vernier delay structure. Offset calibration and delay time locking are implemented to guarantee the ADC performance under process variation. The test chip, fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, occupied a core area of 0.04 mm2. With a 0.4 V supply and a Nyquist rate input, the prototype consumed 200 nW at 250 kS/s and achieved an ENOB of 8.63 bits and a SFDR of 78.5 dB. The operation frequency was scalable from 250 kS/s to 4 MS/s. The converter had a power supply range of 0.4-0.7 V, and the figure of merit (FoM) were 2.02-5.16 fJ/conversion step.},

abstract={Mach-Zehnder-based modulator architectures lend themselves to the realization of high-data-rate Silicon Photonics transmitters. In this work the challenges set by the integration of such devices on silicon are analyzed in depth. The two main alternative electronic driver architectures, namely multistage and travelling wave, are compared with focus to power efficiency. This is, in fact, a key parameter when considering the stringent requirements of standard module form factors. A 25 Gbps multistage and a 56 Gbps travelling wave modulator have been realized. Each electro-optical transmitter is obtained by the 3D assembly of an electronic IC on top of a photonic IC through copper pillars. STMicroelectronics PIC25G Silicon Photonics platform has been adopted for the fabrication of optical devices, while 65 nm CMOS and 55 nm BiCMOS technologies are exploited to realize the electronic drivers. A 30% better power efficiency compared to Silicon Photonics state-of-the-art at similar data rates and comparable extinction ratio performance has been demonstrated in both cases. Since packaging is also a crucial aspect for Silicon Photonics high volume production, experiments on bare dice as well as on packaged chips are reported.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-power always-on image sensor for mobile and wearable device applications. The sensor continuously captures images for smart sensing, such as face detection, eye tracking, and gesture recognition, and it provides high-resolution images for capturing pictures with a unified sensor. The sensor employs a switchable dual mode: always-on (AO) mode with low power consumption and photo-shooting (PS) mode with high signal-to-noise ratio. For dual-mode operation with high energy efficiency, we implemented dynamic voltage scaling that provides 0.9 V analog-digital supply voltage for the AO mode and 3.3 V analog-1.8 V digital supply voltage for the PS mode. For low-voltage operation in the AO mode, a conventional four-transistor pixel operates as a charge-shared pixel. In order to suppress power consumption and frequency in conventional single-slope analog-to-digital converters (ADC), two neighboring column-parallel ADCs are reconfigured to one successive-approximation ADC for low-voltage and low-frequency operation in the AO mode with negligible area overhead. The fabricated 640 × 480 pixel prototype sensor operates at 45.5 μW (at 15 fps, 320 × 240) in the AO mode, which significantly extends battery life when performing always-on sensing.},

abstract={This paper presents a power-saving readout scheme for CMOS image sensors (CISs) that utilizes the image properties. The proposed delta-readout (A-readout) scheme reads the signal difference between two pixels located next to each other (Apixel) by utilizing the most significant bits (MSBs) information of the previous pixel. By effectively reducing the dynamic range of the signal, compensated by the A-window checking, the proposed A-readout scheme can reduce the effective number of decision cycles in a successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and reduce the power consumption while preserving the ADC performance. A prototype QQVGA CIS with ten 10-bit SAR ADCs in a multi-column-parallel (MCP) configuration was fabricated in a 0.18 μm 1P4M CIS process with a 4.4 μm pixel pitch, where each single ADC occupies an area of 70 μm × 500 μm. The measurement results of the implemented prototype CIS showed a maximum power-saving of 26% with a figure-of-merit (FoM) for ADC of 15 fJ/conversion-step.},

The system is designed for Fin Ray® grippers in order to measure the emerging stress on the gripper in operation, enabling the extraction of object shape and operation status. In-plane stress is linearly converted to electrical signals proportional to shear stress and normal stress difference using two sensing elements. Each stress signal is processed and digitized by an integrator and a 10-bit SAR ADC. In contrast to rigid chips, the stress cannot be avoided in the sensitive blocks, such as the signal processing chain and digital controller, when an ultra-thin chip is under deformation. The influence of stress levels, up to 350 MPa, is minimized by using stress-insensitive components, design measures, and layout techniques. This work represents the first demonstration of stress-aware top-to-bottom CMOS design on an ultra-thin chip.},

abstract={A versatile three-lane transmitter/repeater array was designed and manufactured in a production 28nm ultra-thin body and BOX (UTBB) FD-SOI CMOS technology. Each lane in the array can operate at 60 Gb/s with adjustable output swing between 2.6 and 4.3 Vpp with a measured input sensitivity of 10 mVpp at 40 Gb/s, and requires at least 40mVpp input signal level to fully saturate the output driver for maximum swing operation at 60 Gb/s. Scaled, cascaded single-ended CMOS inverter transimpedance amplifiers with resistive and inductive feedback and interstage series inductive peaking were used to form the preamplifiers of each lane. These were optimized for maximum bandwidth and large gain, and drive the >4Vpp swing series-stacked cascoded CMOS inverter output stage. The single-ended CMOS-inverter topologies ensure that the total power consumption scales with the data rate and reduce the lane footprint to that of a ground-signal pad I/O. The measured lane-to-lane isolation is better than 40 dB up to 55 GHz, while the measured Tx-toRx dynamic range, defined as the ratio of the maximum output swing and corresponding minimum input voltage and sensitivity, is larger than 54 dB up to 40 Gb/s.},

pages={2274-2286}, 
abstract={This paper describes a 20 MHz micro-nuclear magnetic resonance (μNMR) transceiver (TRX) featuring a butterfly-coil input for chemical/biological assays. It enables integration with a 2D multi-electrode digital microfluidic (DMF) device inside a space-limited portable magnet (0.46 T, 1.25 kg), making multi-sample management compatible with μNMR measurements, and supporting electronic automation. The transmitter (TX) incorporates a pulse-sequence synthesizer followed by an inverter-based power amplifier (PA), to emit the exciting pulses for magnetizing the protons of the samples. For the receiver (RX), it is headed by a multi-stage low-noise amplifier (LNA) using NMOS-PMOS-complementary differential pairs, achieving a sub-nV/√Hz input-referred noise at low power. Sixth-order Butterworth low-pass filters constitute the core of the RX I/Q baseband. Their source-follower-based topology allows fast and coherent scaling of all poles by the bias current, reducing the dead-time of the RX for better sensitivity. Fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS, the TRX occupies a die area of 2.1 mm2, consumes 6.6/23.7 mW of power in the TX/RX mode, and demonstrates the feasibility of electronic-automated biological (avidin) and chemical (CuSO4) assays achieving a detection limit on avidin of 0.2 pmol.},

abstract={This work presents a sub-6 μW acoustic frontend for speech/non-speech classification in a voice activity detection (VAD) in 90 nm CMOS. Power consumption of the VAD system is minimized by architectural design around a new power-proportional sensing paradigm and the use of machine-learning assisted moderate-precision analog analytics for classification. Power-proportional sensing allows for hierarchical and context-aware scaling of the frontend's power consumption depending on the complexity of the ongoing information extraction, while the use of analog analytics brings increased power efficiency through switching ON/OFF the computation of individual features depending on the features' usefulness in a particular context. The proposed VAD system reduces the power consumption by 10× as compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) systems and yet achieves an 89% average hit rate (HR) for a 12 dB signal-to-acoustic-noise ratio (SANR) in babble context, which is at par with softwarebased VAD systems.},

Current integration combined with a cascode gate-voltage bias gain-control technique enables energy-efficient implementation of CTLE, FFE, and DFE circuits while operating near the speed limits of the technology. Despite following the DFE that has already in principle sliced the data, adaptive error-sampling requires high gain to resolve small residual error signals-this challenge is addressed by the addition of interleaved, offset-canceled deserializing samplers. Clock generation as well as distribution circuits are implemented to complete the receiver frontend.

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2639-2650}, 
abstract={A high-speed driver that provides a pulsewidth modulated output while using a class-D Power Amplifier (PA) is described. A PLL-based architecture is employed, which eliminates the requirement for a precise ramp or triangular signal generator, and a high-speed comparator, which are typically used in pulsewidth modulation (PWM) generation. Multilevel signaling is proposed to enhance back-off as well as peak efficiency, which is critical for signals with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). A differential folded PWM scheme is introduced to achieve highly linear operation. 3-level operation is achieved without the requirement for additional supply source or sink paths, while 5-level operation is achieved with an additional supply source/sink path compared with the 2-level operation. The PWM driver has been implemented in a 130 nm CMOS process and can operate with a switching frequency of 40-170 MHz. For the 2-/3-/5-level PA operation, with a 500 kHz sinusoidal input and 60 MHz switching frequency, the measured THD is -61/-62/-53 dB and the corresponding efficiency is 71%/83%/86% with 175/200/220 mW output power level, respectively. Performance has also been verified for 2-/3-level PA with a high PAPR signal with 500 kHz bandwidth. While intended as a general-purpose amplifier, the approach is well-suited for applications such as power-line communications.},

abstract={A self-referenced VCO-based temperature sensor with reduced supply sensitivity is presented. The proposed sensor converts temperature information to frequency and then into digital bits. A novel sensing technique is proposed in which temperature information is acquired by evaluating the ratio of the output frequencies of two ring oscillators, designed to have different temperature sensitivities, thus avoiding the need for an external frequency reference. Reduced supply sensitivity is achieved by employing the voltage dependence of junction capacitance, thus avoiding the overhead of a voltage regulator. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype can operate with supply voltages ranging from 0.85 V to 1.1 V. It achieves supply sensitivity of 0.034 °C/mV and an inaccuracy of ±0.9 °C and ±2.3 °C from 0 to 100 °C after 2-point calibration, with and without static nonlinearity correction, respectively.

pages={428-439}, 
abstract={A continuous-rate digital clock and data recovery (CDR) with automatic frequency acquisition is presented. The proposed automatic frequency acquisition scheme implemented using a conventional bang-bang phase detector (BBPD) requires minimum additional hardware, is immune to input data transition density, and is applicable to subrate CDRs. A ring-oscillator-based two-stage fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) is used as a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to achieve wide frequency range, low noise, and to decouple the tradeoff between jitter transfer (JTRAN) bandwidth and ring oscillator noise suppression in conventional CDRs. The CDR is implemented using a digital D/PLL architecture to decouple JTRAN bandwidth from jitter tolerance (JTOL) corner frequency, eliminate jitter peaking, and remove JTRAN dependence on BBPD gain. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype CDR achieves error-free operation (BER <; 10-12) from 4 to 10.5 Gb/s with pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) data sequences ranging from PRBS7 to PRBS31. The proposed automatic frequency acquisition scheme always locks the CDR loop within 1000 ppm residual frequency error in worst case. At 10 Gb/s, the CDR consumes 22.5 mW power and achieves a recovered clock long-term jitter of 2.2 psrms/24.0 pspp with PRBS31 input data. The measured JTRAN bandwidth and JTOL corner frequencies are 0.2 and 9 MHz, respectively.},

abstract={Efforts towards energy-harvesting solutions are targeted for wireless sensor node applications and focus on performing maximum power extraction and storing power, yet efforts to deliver a regulated supply to voltage-sensitive blocks in power-limited applications has yet to be fully achieved. This paper presents a low-power, autonomous power management unit (PMU) able to perform maximum power point tracking for dc-type renewable sources. It includes a startup circuit fed directly from the renewable source. The PMU delivers a regulated output voltage through a digital LDO. The main step-up operation is performed through a dynamically controlled, power-aware, capacitive dc-dc converter that performs the required voltage gain procedure. Then, the digital LDO receives the EH source power density information from the dc-dc converter and provides regulation. Information about the source-power density availability is passed on to the digital LDO in order to select the best pass device size from a bank of three arrays. The PMU allows power consumption decrease by reducing the gate driving losses associated with large pass transistor devices, and it enhances efficiency. The system was fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process, and maximum end-to-end efficiency was measured at 57% with 1.75 mW of input power.},

pages={2843-2853}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a technique, called scalable parasitic charge redistribution (SPCR), that reduces the parasitic bottom-plate losses in fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulators up to any desired level. This is realized by continuously redistributing the parasitic charge in-between phase-shifted converter cores. Because earlier models described the ratio of this parasitic coupling to the flying capacitance as the only limiting factor on the achievable fully integrated efficiency, the use of SPCR allows SC converters to achieve efficiencies previously deemed impossible. Transistor leakage is shown to be another limiting factor and is added to existing models which are then used to prove the effectiveness of SPCR over a wide range of power densities (up to 10 W/mm2) and technological parameters. The implementation of SPCR requires little overhead thanks to the use of charge redistribution buses. A 1/2 converter is fabricated in a 40 nm bulk CMOS technology that demonstrates SPCR by achieving a record efficiency for fully integrated closed-loop SC converters of 94.6%.},

The power-mixer bias current is dynamically adjusted based on the instantaneous baseband signal swing using a fully-differential hybrid full-wave rectifier/envelope-detector circuit. Dynamic biasing leads to greater than 50% current savings when compared to fixed-biasing while providing a higher output power with better linearity. Implemented in 28 nm CMOS technology, the TX shows better than -157 dBc/Hz RX-band noise emission and -41 dBc ACLR for output powers up-to +4 dBm across all 3G/4G bands, while demonstrating above 80 dB of gain control range. In addition, the TX can be configured to provide better than -65 dBc CIM3, allowing it to meet stringent spurious emission specifications when transmitting 1 RB 4G LTE signals in B13/B26/B1.},

abstract={This paper presents a miniaturized EPR spectrometer based on a single-chip transceiver. Utilizing a novel on-chip self-interference cancellation circuit, the electromagnetic coupling from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver (RX) is minimized, allowing simultaneous achievement of large TX output power and low RX noise figure (NF). In the measurement, the RX achieves a NF of 3.1 dB/6.3 dB at 10 MHz/50 kHz baseband frequencies, when the TX and cancellation circuits are turned off. The measured flicker noise corner is 60 kHz, more than 10× lower than the prior work. Moreover, for the first time, the operation of the RX and cancellation circuit is demonstrated when a co-integrated TX is operating at the same time and frequency, while producing >20 dBm output power. When the TX and cancellation circuits are turned on, at -10 dBm interference power, the measured NF is 6.8 dB/11.1 dB at 10 MHz/50 kHz baseband frequencies. This is lower by 5.6 dB/9.6 dB at 10 MHz/50 kHz baseband frequencies, compared to the NF with the cancellation circuit off at the same interference power. The transceiver chip is implemented in IBM 0.13 μm BiCMOS process and consumes a power of 2 W. Utilizing this transceiver, an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is built and tested. It is observed, through measurement, that the interference cancellation circuit increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EPR signal by 7 dB at -10 dBm interference power. Compared to prior work, the reported EPR spectrometer improves the sensitivity of the system by 25 dB.},

abstract={This paper presents a 2 GHz digital-to-time converter (DTC) with 244 fs time resolution. The DTC consists of a multi-modulus divider (MMD) and a phase interpolator (PI) as coarse and fine tuning blocks, respectively. Control logic is implemented to prevent shoot-through current during the interpolation process in order to linearize the PI. The measured DTC's peak integral nonlinearity (INL) is 1.2 ps and limited by the PI. The interpolation process is analyzed in detail, describing the root cause of the nonlinearity and indicating key parameters to improve it. Furthermore, a measurement method for DTCs is presented that enables femtosecond accuracy. The DTC has been implemented in standard 28 nm CMOS technology.},

abstract={The dual-frequency dual-inductor multiple-output (DF-DIMO) buck converter topology is presented. The topology employs a dual-phase 20 MHz current-mode-controlled input stage to reduce the inductance required per phase to only 200 nH, and a 4-output 100 MHz comparator-controlled fully integrated output stage to reduce the capacitance required per output to 10 nF. In order to enable each output to handle up to 250 mA load with less than 40 mV voltage ripple, a third-order bond-wire-based notch filter is employed at each output for voltage ripple suppression. Additionally, the proposed design employs dynamic output re-ordering to enhance cross-regulation performance, interleaved pulse-skipping to enhance light-load efficiency and dynamic performance, and high-gain error amplifier in the output feedback loop to enhance DC load regulation. Targeting multi-core DSPs, the proposed design is implemented in standard 65 nm CMOS technology with 1.8 V input, and outputs in the range of 0.6- 1.2 V with a total load of 1 A. It achieves a peak efficiency of 74%, less than 40 mV output voltage ripple, 0.5 V/70 ns dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), and settling time of less than 85 ns for 125 mA load steps; all with no observable cross-regulation transients.},

abstract={This paper presents a room-temperature operating superresolution terahertz (THz) planar near-field solidstate sensor breaking the diffraction limit. Contrary to classical superresolution imagers implemented in the optical domain, the sensor features inbuilt illumination, evanescent-field sensing, and detection on a single chip, eliminating the need for any external optics. Both metallic and dielectric objects can be imaged with the sensor and mapped into a monotonic sensor response. It is operated around 533-555 GHz in 130 nm SiGe HBT technology and is capable of resolving structural details with a μm-range resolution and a high response of up to 21.7 μA with no amplification stages in the readout path. Here, the stop-band characteristic of a differentially driven 3-D split-ring resonator with high spatial confinement of evanescent surface fields is exploited as an object-tunable transmission modulator inserted in-plane between a tunable 3-push Colpitts oscillator and a broadband power detector. A separate antenna-coupled oscillator breakout provides a radiated power of up to 45 μW (-13.4 dBm). This paper further demonstrates the 2-D scanned superresolution image with a remarkable SNR of up to 40 dB for the sensor operating at dc.},

abstract={A fully integrated successive-approximation (SAR) switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter is presented that overcomes the coarse output voltage resolution limitation of traditional SC converters. An SAR SC converter cascades multiple stages of 2:1 SC converters, and achieves a fine-grained conversion ratio resolution of VIN/2N, where VIN is the input voltage and N is the number of stages. As the SAR SC converter generates the output voltage through SAR, each stage of 2:1 SC converter provides a fixed voltage level, requiring minimal configuration change for regulation. Analysis shows that the SAR SC converter has a slow-switching-limit output impedance increasing proportionally to log2 (number of resolution), and switching loss of bottom-plate parasitic capacitor decreasing with the number of stages. As a test chip, an SAR SC converter with 7 b resolution is fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process and implemented by cascading 4:1 and five 2:1 two-phase interleaving SC stages. It achieves 31.25 mV voltage resolution with output voltages over 0.4 V at VIN = 4 V. Using this fine grain voltage regulation approach, line and load regulations are implemented with a feedback/feedforward controller with peak efficiency of 72% for load currents from 0 to 300 μA. The test chip occupies 1.69 mm2 and utilizes on-chip capacitors of 2.24 nF in total.},

pages={598-613}, 
abstract={This paper presents a broadband mixed-signal CMOS power amplifier (PA) with a hybrid Class-G Doherty architecture for PA efficiency enhancement up to the deep power back-off (PBO) region. Our proposed mixed-signal linearization technique ensures the PA's amplitude modulation (AM)-AM linearity by digital PA operation and suppresses the PA's AM-phase modulation (PM) nonlinearity by real-time analog phase compensation. The PA is fully integrated in a standard 65 nm bulk CMOS process, and achieves a peak output power (Pout ) of +26.7 dBm with a 40.2% peak drain efficiency (DE) at 3.71 GHz. The DE at 6 and 12 dB PBO is 1.8× and 2.6× over the reference Class-B PA operation, advancing the state-of-the-art CMOS PA PBO efficiency performance. The PA 1 dB bandwidth is extended from 1.08 to 1.8 GHz by reconfiguring the phase difference between the main and auxiliary paths in the Doherty PA. In the modulation measurements with 1 MSym/s 16 QAM signals, the PA performs dynamic hybrid Class-G Doherty operation and achieves +20.8 dBm peak Pout with 28.8% DE at 3.71 GHz and 2.42× efficiency enhancement at 8.1 dB PBO over Class-B operation.

abstract={This paper presents an energy-efficient oscillator for wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). It avoids short-circuit current by minimizing the time spent in the input voltage range from Vthn to [Vdd - |Vthp|]. A current-feeding scheme with gate voltage control enables the oscillator to operate over a wide frequency range. A test chip is fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. The measurements show that the proposed oscillator achieves a constant energy-per-cycle (EpC) of 0.8 pJ/cycle over the 21-60 MHz frequency range and is more efficient than a conventional currentstarved ring oscillator (CSRO) below 300 kHz at 1.8 V supply voltage. As an application example, the proposed oscillator is implemented in a switched-capacitor DC-DC converter. The converter is 11%-56% more efficient for load power values ranging from 583 pW to 2.9 nW than a converter using a conventional CSRO.},

abstract={Single-mode wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical links are an attractive technology to meet the growing interconnect bandwidth demand in data center applications. This paper presents a multi-channel hybridintegrated photonic receiver based on microring drop filters and waveguide photodetectors implemented in a 130 nm SOI process and high-speed optical front-ends designed in 65 nm CMOS. The source-synchronous receiver utilizes an LC injection-locked oscillator (ILO) in the clock path for improved jitter filtering, while maintaining correlated jitter tracking with the data channels. Receiver sensitivity is improved with a large input-stage feedback resistor transimpedance amplifier (TIA) cascaded with an adaptively-tuned continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE). In order to stabilize the microring drop filter resonance wavelength, a peak-detector-based thermal tuning loop is implemented with a 0.7 nm range at 43 μW/GHz efficiency. When tested with a waveguide photodetector with 0.45 A/W responsivity, the receiver achieves -8.0 dBm OMA sensitivity at a BER = 10-12 with a jitter tolerance corner frequency near 20 MHz and a per-channel power consumption of 17 mW including amortized clocking power.},

abstract={High-frequency systems such as mm-wave radar transmitters and LO/RF driver chains in vector network analyzers (VNAs) often require the generation of signals with high output power. While these systems benefit considerably from the reduction in size and cost provided by SiGe integration, their output power must be further increased in order to meet the performance of other technologies (e.g., GaAs). To this end, a SiGe signal generator MMIC was developed that achieves 28.7 dBm peak output power with 21.9% PAE and over 27.4 dBm of output power over the whole frequency range from 19.7 GHz to 28.2 GHz. The output power is scalable with DC current up to a maximum of 30.8 dBm. The signal generator is based on a VCO, power amplifier cells (PA cells) and lumped-element Wilkinson power combiners/dividers. The VCO's phase noise is less than -96 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset over the entire frequency range. The developed single PA cell achieves a maximum saturated output power Psat of 24.7 dBm with peak PAE of 31%. This article describes the design and performance of all components. The signal generator MMIC has been integrated in an evaluation board together with a PLL, power supply, and serial interface.},

abstract={This paper presents a multi-gigabit communication link over a polymer microwave fiber (PMF). A polymer fiber is a light-weight and low-loss channel at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. PMF is a promising, robust and low-cost technology to complement copper or optical links for high-speed applications with transmission distances up to several meters. The high carrier frequency of 120 GHz ensures low bending losses for small bending radii and features a large absolute bandwidth, which can be exploited to achieve high data rates with a simple modulation scheme. The used continuous-phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) modulation results in a power-efficient system at both the TX and the RX side. We report on 120 GHz 40 nm bulk CMOS TX and RX chips, the fiber and the coupling solution between the chips and the fiber. Data rates up to 12.7 Gbps over 1 meter, transmission lengths up to 7 meters at 2.5 Gbps and a link energy efficiency of 1.8 pJ/b/m for 4 meters and 7.4 Gbps are achieved for the complete communication link.},

abstract={Most memory-chip manufacturers keep trying to supply cost-effective storage devices with high-performance characteristics such as shorter tPROG, lower power consumption and higher endurance. For many years, every effort has been made to shrink die size to lower cost and to improve performance. However, the previously used node-shrinking methodology is facing challenges due to increased cell-to-cell interference and patterning difficulties caused by decreasing dimension. To overcome these limitations, 3D-stacking technology has been developed. As a result of long and focused research in 3D stacking technology, we succeed in developing 128 Gb 3b/cell Vertical NAND with 32 stack WL layers for the first time, which is the smallest 128 Gb NAND Flash. The die size is 68.9 mm 2, program time is 700 us and I/O rate is 1 Gb/s.},

abstract={This paper presents a 10 b 80 kS/s SAR ADC with low-power duty-cycled reference generation. It generates a stable reference voltage on chip for the SAR ADC and imparts very good immunity against power supply interference to the ADC. A 0.62 V-VDD 25 nW CMOS reference voltage generator (RVG) is presented, which has only ±1.5% variation over process corners. A duty-cycling technique is applied to enable 10% duty-cycling of the RVG, resulting in negligible power consumption of the RVG compared to that of the ADC. Furthermore, a bi-directional dynamic preamplifier is adopted in the SAR ADC, which consumes about half the power compared with a regular dynamic structure and maintains noise and gain performance. Compared with prior-art low-power ADCs, this work is the first to integrate the reference generation and include it in the power consumption while maintaining a competitive 2.4 fJ/conversion-step FoM. The chip is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology.},

abstract={This paper presents an adaptive and resilient domino register file design featuring in-situ timing margin and error detection for the performance-critical domino read path. Voltage/frequency is adapted for slow-changing variations such as low-frequency supply noise, temperature fluctuation, and aging-induced degradation. Dynamic adaptation is combined with error detection and recovery for fast voltage droops and random data access patterns in the presence of within-die process variations. Throughput and energy efficiency gains are higher than the replica/canary based critical path approach. Timing margin is tracked by double-sampling the read output and its delayed version at the same clock edge. Timing errors are detected by double-sampling and comparing the read output within a clock window. The sensing errors in the precharge/evaluate domino read path are converted into timing errors using a conditional delayed-bitline precharge technique that does not impact the subsequent precharge operation. The proposed techniques incur 6-13% area overhead and 0.2-0.3% power overhead for a 4 Kb sub-array. The measurement results from a 22 nm tri-gate CMOS testchip demonstrate 21% throughput and 67% energy efficiency improvement with a peak energy efficiency of 409 GOPS/W.},

abstract={This paper proposes a fully-integrated high-conversion-ratio dual-output voltage boost converter (VBC) with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuits for low-voltage energy harvesting. The VBC consists of two voltage generators that generate VOUT1 and VOUT2. VOUT1 and VOUT2 are three and nine times higher than the harvester's output VIN, respectively. VOUT1 is used as a supply voltage for on-chip application circuits while VOUT2 is used as the charging voltage for a Li-ion secondary battery. The VBC achieves a high voltage conversion ratio (max. × 9) and a high power conversion efficiency. The MPPT circuits control the operating frequencies of the CPs to extract maximum power at each output. The measurement results demonstrated that the circuit converted a 0.59 V input to a 1.41 V output with 75.8% efficiency when the output powers of VOUT1 and VOUT2 were 396 and 0 μW, respectively, and a 0.62 V input to a 4.54 V output with 49.1% efficiency when the output powers were 0 and 114 μW, respectively.},

title={A 1/f Noise Upconversion Reduction Technique for Voltage-Biased RF CMOS Oscillators}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2610-2624}, 
abstract={In this paper, we propose a method to reduce a flicker (1/f) noise upconversion in voltage-biased RF oscillators. Excited by a harmonically rich tank current, a typical oscillation voltage waveform is observed to have asymmetric rise and fall times due to even-order current harmonics flowing into the capacitive part, as it presents the lowest impedance path. The asymmetric oscillation waveform results in an effective impulse sensitivity function of a nonzero dc value, which facilitates the 1/f noise upconversion into the oscillator's 1/f3 phase noise. We demonstrate that if the ω0 tank exhibits an auxiliary resonance at 2ω0, thereby forcing this current harmonic to flow into the equivalent resistance of the 2ω0 resonance, then the oscillation waveform would be symmetric and the flicker noise upconversion would be largely suppressed. The auxiliary resonance is realized at no extra silicon area in both inductor-and transformer-based tanks by exploiting different behaviors of inductors and transformers in differential-and common-mode excitations. These tanks are ultimately employed in designing modified class-D and class-F oscillators in 40 nm CMOS technology. They exhibit an average flicker noise corner of less than 100 kHz.},

abstract={A multimode delta-sigma (ΔΣ) RF digital-to-analog converter (RF-DAC) is proposed for direct digital-to-RF synthesis. The proposed circuit uses a single clock frequency (f8) and provides a ΔΣ modulator (DSM) that operates in bandpass (BP) and highpass (HP) modes to synthesize signals around f8/4, f8/2, or 3f8/4. The on-chip 14 bit second-order DSM implements an array of 1 bit pipelined subtract functions to generate 3 bit f8 rate RF-DAC input data. Analog interleaving via a second 3 bit DAC is used to reject the first DAC image, simultaneously doubling the usable bandwidth of the HP DSM and increasing the SNR. Calibration circuits are added to the DAC to compensate for amplitude and timing variations. The proposed RF-DAC is implemented in 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS with an area of 0.563 mm2. Measurements at f8 = 2 GHz yield an output power of -0.6 dBm with 76.2 dB signal-to-image-rejection ratio (SIRR), 76.2 dB SFDR over a 100 MHz bandwidth, -80 dBc IM3, -67.2 dB WCDMA ACLR, and -66.4 dBc LTE ACLR. Changing f8 to 3 GHz allows frequencies of 2.25 GHz to be generated with output power of -16.6 dBm, 65.2 dB SFDR, -62 dBc IM3, -59.3 dB WCDMA ACLR, and -59.2 dBc LTE ACLR.},

year={2016},

number={11}, 
pages={2716-2728}, 
abstract={This work proposes an energy-recycling (ER) technique for power management among a photovoltaic (PV) module, battery, and load in light energy harvesting systems. The ER technique delivers all harvested PV energy directly to the load with surplus energy recycled from the load to the battery, and can eliminate inductor-sharing power switches in single-inductor dual-input dual-output (SIDIDO) converters. Accordingly, the proposed dual-path 3-switch (2P3S) converter, which operates in discontinuous-conduction mode and regulates load voltage by constant-on-time pulse-skipping modulation, was developed. Under dynamic PV power PP and load power PL profiles, the 2P3S converter's advantageous applications are identified by comparing efficiencies of state-of-the-art SIDIDO converters. The overall efficiency under static PP and PL profiles and indirect-path efficiency under dynamic PP and PL profiles are maximized by optimizing switch sizes and on-time. The chip has three power switches and a controller employing low-power circuits, and is fabricated in 0.5 μm CMOS process with 0.5 mm2 active area. The measured controller current is 0.85 μA. Under static PP and PL profiles, for PP of 40 μW, efficiency is 80.7% to 95.0% for 0 μW to 20 mW load power. Compared with other state-of-the-arts, the 2P3S converter has the highest efficiency under static PP and PL profiles and higher efficiency with more PV energy directly consumed by the load under dynamic PP and PL profiles.},

volume={51},

pages={1210-1222}, 
abstract={Frequency synthesis at mm-wave range suffers from a severe tradeoff between phase noise (PN) and frequency tuning range (FTR). This work presents the analysis and compares the performance of fundamental-mode voltage-controlled oscillators (F-VCOs) to harmonic-mode VCOs (H-VCOs). It is shown that unlike a mm-wave F-VCO, an H-VCO can simultaneously achieve higher FTR and lower PN. An H-VCO architecture, denoted as self-mixing VCO (SMV), is presented where the VCO core generates both the first (fο) and second harmonic (2fο) and then mixes them together to obtain the desired mm-wave third-harmonic (3fο). Use of a Class-C push-push topology as the VCO core enhances the second-harmonic content to improve mixing efficiency, decreases parasitic capacitance, and improves PN. Compared to an F-VCO operating in a mm-wave band at a fundamental frequency that equals 3fο, the proposed SMV architecture achieves about 2× higher FTR and a better PN performance. A 52.8-62.5 GHz SMV prototype is designed and implemented in a 0.13 μm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the VCO achieves an FTR of 16.8% with a PN of -100.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset-resulting in an FTR-inclusive figure-of-merit (FoMT) of -190.85 dBc/Hz while consuming 7.6 mW from a 1.2 V supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a high-efficiency wideband hybrid supply modulator (HSM). We show that proper control of the average current from the class-AB linear amplifier (LA) and proper selection of the inductor value are essential to efficiency optimization. In line with the above criteria, a single-capacitor current-integration (SCCI) control method is proposed. Current integration is achieved by using a single capacitor, circumventing the need of the high-speed full-range current sensor required for conventional HSMs and reducing the design complexity greatly. The ripple current of the LA is controlled indirectly, and enhanced efficiency is achieved by enforcing the average output current from the LA to be around zero. A wideband LA is proposed to suppress the output voltage ripple. A proof-of-concept design using an inductor with an optimized value of 100 nH is fabricated in 130 nm CMOS technology. It switches at a peak frequency of 50 MHz, achieves up to 8% efficiency improvement when compared to recent works, and is able to track a 0.8 Vpp sinusoidal signal with high fidelity up to 10 MHz. The measured output voltage ripple is reduced to below 8 mV. The peak conversion efficiency is 88.3% at the maximum output power of 23 dBm.},

abstract={An energy-efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) processor is proposed for high-speed Visual Attention (VA) engine in a mobile vision recognition SoC. The proposed embedded DNN (E-DNN) processor realizes VA to rapidly find Region-Of-Interest (ROI) tiles of potential target objects to reduce ~ 70% of recognition workloads of a vision recognition SoC. Compared to the previous scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) based VA models, the proposed E-DNN VA model reduces the execution time by ~ 90%, which results in 73.4% reduction of the overall object recognition (OR) processing time. Also, the proposed E-DNN VA model shows ~4% higher OR accuracy for 113-object database (13 laboratory object database + COIL-100 objects database) than the previous model shows. Highly-parallel 200-way PEs are implemented in the E-DNN processor with 2D-axis layer sliding architecture, and only ~3 ms of the E-DNN VA latency can be obtained. In addition, the dual-mode configurable PE architecture is proposed to support both Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) by utilizing the same hardware resources for high energy efficiency. As a result, the implemented E-DNN processor achieves only 1.9 nJ/pixel energy efficiency which is 7.7× smaller than the state-of-the-art VA accelerator which showed 14.6 nJ/pixel energy efficiency.},

abstract={The linearity of the vast majority of the ADC topologies is limited by the linearity of the circuit elements employed in their design, such as resistors and capacitors. This paper presents a charge-mode SAR ADC architecture that uses only highly nonlinear metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors (MOSCAPs) as the DAC capacitance elements. The non-linearity of the MOSCAPs is exploited to improve the tolerance of the ADC to comparator offset and noise. The architecture employs local voltage boosting and a new boost-and-bootstrap switch to allow operation with an over-rails input range. A 9 bit prototype is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS process and operates with a supply voltage of 0.6 V, handling a differential input range of 1.7 Vpp. The prototype achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) larger than 8.5 for a temperature range of -40 to 85°C, despite the strong dependency of MOSCAPs to temperature. Operating at 1 MSps, the prototype consumes 2.78 μW, leading to a figure of merit (FoM) of 7.8 fJ/conversion-step.},

abstract={A 5.58 nW real-time clock using a crystal oscillator is presented. In this circuit, the amplifier used in a traditional circuit is replaced with pulsed drivers. The pulse is generated with precise timing using a DLL. With this approach, an extremely low oscillation amplitude of 160 mV results in low-power operation. This low-amplitude oscillation is sustained robustly using additional supply voltages: a lower supply for the final drive stage and a higher supply used for pulses that drive the final drive stage, which ensures low ON-resistance necessary for reliable operation. The different supply levels are generated on-chip by a switched capacitor network (SCN) from a single supply. The circuit has been tested at different supply voltages and temperatures. It shows a minimum power consumption of 5.58 nW and power supply sensitivity of 30.3 ppm/V over supply voltage of 0.94-1.2 V, without degrading the crystal's temperature dependency: between -20 °C and 80 °C. Moreover, its performance as a real-time clock has been verified by measurement of an Allan deviation of 1.16 × 10-8.},

abstract={This paper reports on the implementation of an interface ASIC for MEMS vibratory gyroscopes exhibiting a wide tuning range from 7 to 31 kHz with a power consumption of 1.6 mW and a dynamic range of 92 dB over a signal band of 40 Hz. The drive loop of the system employs a high voltage stage based on flying capacitors for the excitation of the drive mass allowing a startup time of 44 ms. For the detection of the Coriolis signal, a fourth-order closed-loop electromechanical sense loop deploying continuous-time (CT) circuit techniques and ΔΣ-modulation is implemented. The sense loop deploys a high-Q electronic resonator based on gm-C circuits and a collocated charge-integrator for signal readout and for generating feedback forces. The readout interface with an active circuit area of 2.42 mm2 is fabricated in a 0.35 μm CMOS technology with a HV-module. The ASIC achieves a noise floor of 0.007°/s/√Hz over 40 Hz while the full-scale range is higher than ±1400°/s and the bias stability measures 2.6°/h. The wide tuning capability of the ASIC is demonstrated on the basis of two tested MEMS gyroscopes for different applications with an equal ASIC performance.},

abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma modulator using a Gm-C based noise-shaped integrating quantizer (NSIQ) with a digital back-end integrator. By incorporating the digital back-end integrator, the tradeoff between resolution and speed for a conventional time-based NSIQ is alleviated. Using only three clock edges and a low-power Gm-C, effective 4-bit quantization with an additional first order noise-shaping is achieved. Also, the linearity requirement of the quantizer is relaxed by employing the digital back-end integrator.

abstract={A 16 Gb/s 1-tap Infinite impulse response (IIR) + 1-tap discrete-time (DT) decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with integrated clock recovery and adaptation is demonstrated in 28 nm FD-SOI CMOS. Using a CMOS phase rotator, 0.7 unit interval (UI) high-frequency jitter tolerance is achieved when operating mesochronously, and over 0.4 UI operating plesiochronously. The half-rate architecture includes a novel 2:1 multiplexer to reduce delay in the IIR feedback path. With a 28 dB loss channel, a BER below 10-12 is measured over a 0.32 UI timing window with a TX swing of 0.8 Vpp-diff. Using a 2 Vpp-diff TX swing, a 30 dB loss channel has a measured BER below 10-12 over a 0.3 UI timing window. A novel edge-based algorithm adapts both IIR and DT equalizer coefficients using the same high-speed circuitry and signals required for clock recovery. The algorithm utilizes all transitions to inform the adaptation of all equalizer coefficients, thereby providing faster convergence than previously-reported algorithms which await specific patterns. Moreover, the adaptation freezes automatically unless a diverse set of data patterns is received, thereby making the algorithm robust in the presence of poorly-conditioned data. The adaptive DFE converges within 5 μs.},

The direct-coupled chopper-stabilized neural recording front end rejects up to ±50 mV input dc offset using an in-channel digitally assisted feedback loop. It yields a compact 0.018 mm2 integration area and 4.2 μVrms integrated input-referred noise over 1 Hz to 1 kHz frequency range. A multiplying specific absorption rate (SAR) ADC in each channel calibrates channel-to-channel gain mismatch. A multicore low-power DSP performs synchrony-based neurological event detection and triggers a subset of 64 programmable current-mode stimulators for subsequent neuromodulation. Triple-band FSK/ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transmitters communicate to receivers located at 10 cm to 10 m distance from the SoC with data rates from 1.2 to 45 Mbps. An inductive link that operates at 1.5 MHz, provides power and is also used to communicate commands to an on-chip ASK receiver. The chip occupies 16 mm2 while consuming 2.17 and 5.8 mW with UWB and FSK transmitters, respectively. Efficacy of the SoC is assessed using a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by spontaneous seizures.

abstract={Phase noise performance of ring oscillator based digital fractional-N phase-locked loops (FNPLLs) is severely compromised by conflicting bandwidth requirements to simultaneously suppress oscillator phase and quantization noise introduced by the time-to-digital converter (TDC), ΔΣ fractional divider, and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). As a consequence, their figure-of-merit (FoMJ) that quantifies the power-jitter tradeoff is at least 25 dB worse than their LC-oscillator-based FNPLL counterparts. This paper seeks to close this performance gap by extending PLL bandwidth (BW) using quantization noise cancellation techniques and by employing a dual-path digital loop filter to suppress the detrimental impact of DAC quantization noise. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process, the proposed FNPLL operates over a wide frequency range of 2.0-5.5 GHz using a modified extended range multi-modulus divider with seamless switching. The proposed digital FNPLL achieves 1.9 psrms integrated jitter while consuming only 4 mW at 5 GHz output. The measured in-band phase noise is better than -96 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The proposed FNPLL achieves wide BW up to 6 MHz using a 50 MHz reference and its FoMJ is -228.5 dB, which is the best among all reported ring-based FNPLLs.},

The SLSCC absorbs inter-layer load power mismatch to provide minimum voltage guarantees for the internal rails of a multicore system that implements four-way voltage stacking. A new hybrid feedback control scheme reduces the voltage ripple across stacked voltage layers for high levels of current mismatch, a condition that exacerbates voltage noise in conventional SC converters. Furthermore, the proposed SLSCC dynamically allocates valuable flying capacitor resources according to different load conditions, which improves conversion efficiency and supports more power mismatch between the layers. Implemented in TSMC's 40G process, the SLSCC converts a 3.6 V input voltage down to four stacked output voltage layers, each nominally at 900 mV.},

pages={401-411}, 
abstract={A low-jitter and fractional-resolution injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) with a delay-locked-loop (DLL)-based process-voltage-temperature (PVT)-calibrator is proposed. The ring-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and the voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) of the DLL consist of identical delay cells, and they share the same control voltage. Thus, by changing the ratio between the numbers of stages of the VCDL and the VCO, the frequency of the VCO can be calibrated at any target frequencies, noninteger times the reference frequency. As the amount of the unit delay is adjusted continuously by the DLL, the VCO can overcome real-time frequency drifts as well as static process variations; thus, excellent jitter performance can be sustained during any environmental variations. The proposed ILCM, designed in the 65 nm CMOS process, generated output frequencies that range from 1.2 to 2.0 GHz with a frequency resolution of 40 MHz and a 400 MHz reference clock. When injection locked, the integrated jitter from 1 kHz to 40 MHz of the 1.6 GHz signal was 440 fs. The proposed real-time PVT calibrator restricted the degradations of phase noise and jitter over the temperature and the supply variations to less than 0.7 dB and 20%, respectively. The active area was 0.32 mm2 and the power consumption was 3.6 mW.},

To verify the proposed FFE architecture, we fabricated the conventional and the proposed FFEs in 65 nm CMOS technology and tested eye sensitivity and eye variation at 8 Gb/s on 25 dB, 13.2 dB, and 9.6 dB PCB traces. Compared to the conventional FFE Tx, the proposed FFE Tx improves the eye sensitivity and the eye variation by about 230% on a 25 dB lossy channel without calibration. In addition, this improvement increases as the channel loss increases. The proposed FFE Tx also improves the power efficiency by 230% at 25% utilization on a 25 dB lossy channel. These results imply that the proposed FFE Tx can reduce calibration circuits in a massively parallel I/Os and the power consumption.},

abstract={This paper describes a transmitter driver based on a CMOS inverter with a resistive feedback. By employing the proposed driver topology, the pre-driver can be greatly simplified, resulting in a remarkable reduction of the overall driver power consumption. It also offers another advantage that the implementation of equalization is straightforward, compared with a conventional voltage-mode driver. Furthermore, the output impedance remains relatively constant while the data is being transmitted, resulting in good signal integrity. For evaluation of the driver performance, a fully functional 20 Gb/s transmitter is implemented, including a PRBS generator, a serializer, and a half-rate clock generator. In order to enhance the overall speed of the digital circuits for 20 Gb/s data transmission, the resistive feedback is applied to the time-critical inverters, which enables shorter rise/fall times. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The implemented driver circuit operates up to the data rate of 20 Gb/s, exhibiting an energy efficiency of 0.4 pJ/b for the output swing of 250 mVpp,diff.},

abstract={This paper presents a 12-bit 2 GS/s dual-rate hybrid DAC using bandwidth- and linearity-enhancement techniques. The proposed pulsed-error pre-distortion scheme enhances DAC linearity at both low and high signal frequencies by leveraging the fine time-and-voltage resolution from the oversampling path of the hybrid DAC structure. To further widen the DAC bandwidth, a noise-cancellation scheme is proposed to suppress the quantization noise of the delta-sigma modulator within DC to the 1 GHz band without increasing modulator complexity. The analytical derivations and numerical simulations of the proposed techniques are provided to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness, as well as its practical design constraints. A proof-of-concept silicon prototype is implemented in 65 nm standard CMOS that achieves SFDR of 74-98 dBc over the DC-1GHz Nyquist band. In a two-tone measurement, the IM3 product is measured from 101 dBc to 80 dBc across the Nyquist band. The SFDR improvement after enabling the proposed pulsed pre-distortion scheme measures from 67.5 to 74.4dBc, while the in-band noise floor demonstrates 6 dB suppression at the Nyquist band edge after enabling the noise-cancellation scheme.},

title={Oscillator-Based Reactance Sensors With Injection Locking for High-Throughput Flow Cytometry Using Microwave Dielectric Spectroscopy}, 
year={2016},

number={2}, 
pages={457-472}, 
abstract={This paper presents the analysis and design of oscillator-based reactance sensors employing injection locking for high-throughput label-free single-cell analysis using dielectric spectroscopy at microwave frequencies. By injection-locking two sensing LC-oscillators with an I/Q excitation source, the measurement of the sample-induced frequency shift caused by the interaction with the electromagnetic fields is performed through phase detection with injection-strength-dependent transducer gain. Such inherent phase amplification offered by the injection locking not only relaxes the design requirement for the readout circuits but also maintains the highest rejection against common-mode errors associated with the drift of the supply voltage and the environmental parameters. To reduce flicker noise contribution, a chopping technique employing phase modulation is exploited. In addition, this paper presents a novel ping-pong chopping approach to alleviate chopping-induced dc offset. In this prototype, four sensing channels, covering frequencies between 6.5 and 30 GHz, are distributed along a microfluidic channel fabricated with standard photolithography. Measurements show that the proposed microwave capacitive sensors achieve a sub-aFrms of noise sensitivity at 100 kHz filtering bandwidth, enabling measurement throughput exceeding 1 k cells/s. The sensor prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and consumes 65 mW at 1 V supply.},

pages={303-309}, 
abstract={In the near future, the ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems will be a key technique to enable the IoT era. A new computing architecture called Ising computing and implemented using CMOS circuits is proposed. This computing maps the problems to an Ising model, a model to express the behavior of magnetic spins, and solves combinatorial optimization problems efficiently exploiting its intrinsic convergence properties. In the computing, “CMOS annealing” is used to find a better solution for the problems. A 20k-spin prototype Ising chip is fabricated in 65 nm process. The Ising chip achieves 100 MHz operation and its capability of solving combinatorial optimization problems using an Ising model is confirmed. The power efficiency of the chip can be estimated to be 1800 times higher than that of a general purpose CPU when running an approximation algorithm.},

abstract={A 12 GHz VGA showing a gain variation range from -9 dB to 13 dB with a linear-in-dB gain control feature is presented in this work. As the gain is changed, the phase shift over the entire 10-14.4 GHz bandwidth varies as little as ≤ 2° due to a compensation circuitry that reduces the input-output phase shift sensitivity to gain variations in a robust manner with respect to temperature changes. Such a reduced phase shift variation is particularly useful to simplify the signal phase/amplitude control for the various paths of a phased array system, and allows to implement ultra-low sidelobe phased arrays. The VGA prototypes, implemented in a SiGe bipolar technology, show a noise figure of 5.1 dB, an IIP3 of -3 dBm, a P1dB of -17 dBm, and a power consumption of 83 mW.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS millimeter-wave (mm-wave) receiver designed to meet the challenges in low-power, ultra-broadband, phased-array systems with a large number of array elements. This receiver employs a high intermediatefrequency (IF) heterodyne architecture to reduce the frequency and power consumption associated with distributing a local oscillator (LO). The receiver operates over a bandwidth of 51-71 GHz, while maintaining 20 GHz of bandwidth along the signal chain of the entire mm-wave front end, through a high-IF stage, and to the baseband output. To maintain a high fractional bandwidth (fBW) throughout the signal chain, this receiver employs multiple gainequalized transformers. Receiver measurements show an overall flat bandwidth response of 20 GHz, with a total gain of 20 dB, a minimum double-sideband noise figure of 7.8 dB, and an input 1 dB compression power of -24 dBm while consuming 115 mW from a 1.1 V supply.

abstract={This work demonstrates a self-adjustable clock generator that closely tracks the voltage dependence of the critical path delay in a microprocessor. A tunable replica circuit (TRC) composed of inverter cells from the standard-cell library performs real-time frequency modulation to reduce the response time to a single cycle, and a digital controller quantizes the clock frequency by selecting appropriate phases of a delay-locked loop (DLL) that generates 16 phases of 2 GHz output. A watchdog unit continuously monitors the clock output to guard against metastability arising from the asynchronous path between the controller and the DLL. The proposed design is implemented in a 28 nm UTBB FDSOI technology and occupies an area of 1120 μm2 with 2.7 mW power consumption.

abstract={This work presents an 0.32 V self-powered high dynamic range (DR) CMOS imager in standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology with dual-mode operation: imaging (IMG) and optical energy harvesting (OEH) modes.

abstract={In this work, a switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) that dithers flying capacitance to reduce output voltage ripple is presented, and the benefits of such ripple reduction are investigated. In the proposed technique, SC converters are designed to run at the maximum available frequency, and the flying capacitance for different phases is adjusted according to load current change through comparators and a digital controller.

On-chip circuits for ripple measurement and load performance monitoring were included to accurately assess the magnitude and impact of ripple reduction. Measurement results show that at a 2.3 V input, an on-chip ripple magnitude of 6-16 mV at 1 V output is achieved for 11-142 mA load. Peak efficiency is 70.8% at a power density of 0.187 W/mm2.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={2}, 
pages={484-495}, 
abstract={A custom transceiver IC is designed to implement a portable brain imaging system based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The fNIRS IC generates multichannel time-divided spread-spectrum codes (TDSSCs) and drives light-emitting devices in the transmitter (Tx) chain, and performs optimum filtering, quantization, and serialization in the receiver (Rx) chain. A dual slope ADC subsequent to an operational transconductance amplifier-C-based matched filter shares a capacitor to save area while achieving optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the brain channel. The Rx chain including an off-chip TIA ensures sufficient electrical SNR irrespective of the brain region for the accurate extraction of hemodynamic response. The minimum detectable light power of the Rx chain is 400 fW. The output power of the Tx is made adjustable by controlling the occurrence rate and the power of the TDSSC to reduce subject-dependent measurement variations. The proposed fNIRS system measures 42 brain regions simultaneously, and the experimental results clearly verify the validity of the proposed portable fNIRS system.},

abstract={In this paper, an all-digital delay-locked loop (ADDLL) with a phase-tracing delay unit (PTDU) has been proposed to achieve wide-operating frequency range, low power, and low cost. For the wide-range DLL, the long delay line is replaced by a PTDU which includes two gated ring oscillators (GROs) for generating the wide delay range with a reduced die area. According to the dual-loop control scheme in this work, the input clock rising edge and falling edge are tracked independently to ensure that the ADDLL output maintains the duty cycle of the input reference. Furthermore, the ADDLL utilizes an open-loop scheme to achieve fast lock time of five clock cycles for all supported input frequencies. The proposed ADDLL has been fabricated in TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology and supports a wide-operating frequency range from 6.7 MHz to 1.24 GHz within a small active area of 0.0318 mm2. The measured peak-to-peak and root-mean-square jitter at 1.24 GHz are 2.22 ps and 424.62 fs, respectively. The ADDLL consumes 14.5 mW while operating at 1.24 GHz.},

The proposed hybrid architecture combines the design benefits of different ADC structures to achieve a high conversion rate and accuracy with good power efficiency. The design employs multiple offset calibration schemes to compensate the offset mismatches at each stage. The solutions require less calibration efforts, thus allowing the ADC to achieve a compact area. Furthermore, a dynamic SAR controller embedded with error-decision-correction (EDC) logic is proposed to reduce large transition error. Measurement results on a 65 nm CMOS prototype operated at 450 MS/s and 1.2 V supply show 7.4 mW total power consumption with a peak signal-to-noise distortion ratio (SNDR) of 60.8 dB and an FOM of 32 fJ/conv.step at Nyquist.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2287-2298}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) SoC implemented in asynchronous architecture, which does not require system clock as well as off-chip antenna. Several low power techniques are proposed to minimize power consumption. At the system level, a newly introduced event-driven system architecture facilitates the asynchronous implementation, thus removes the system clock leading to a true ECG-on-chip solution. A DC-coupled analog front-end is introduced together with a baseline stabilizer to boost the input impedance to 3.6 GQ and mitigate the electrode offset, which is less sensitive to motion artefact and contact impedance imbalance, making it well suited for dry-electrode based applications. Level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LC-ADC) is employed to take the advantage of burst nature of ECG signal leading to at least 5 times reduction in sampling points compared to Nyquist sampling. A digitally implemented impulse-radio ultra-wideband transmitter is seamlessly integrated with LC-ADC and an on-chip antenna for wireless communications. Implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS technology, the ECG-on-chip consumes 2.89 μW under 1.2 V supply while transmitting the raw ECG data, which attains one order of magnitude lower than the current state-of-the-art designs. The fully integrated ECG SoC requires no external clocks and off-chip antenna, making it a good candidate for low cost and disposable wireless ECG patches, such as epidermal electronics.},

pages={1235-1245}, 
abstract={This paper presents an energy-efficient third-order 3 bit continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM). In this work, several architectural and circuit techniques are adopted to facilitate a low-power modulator. In the loop filter design, a single-amplifier biquad (SAB) topology is incorporated to realize the desired transfer function. With the SAB architecture, only two amplifiers are needed for implementing a third-order CTDSM. Furthermore, in the proposed SAB, the excess-loop-delay (ELD) compensation is implemented without using an extra summing circuit. For the 3 bit quantizer, a time-domain quantizer is proposed, where the data-weighted-averaging function is embedded in this quantizer to mitigate the nonlinearity issue due to the mismatch of digital-to-analog converter (DAC) unit cells. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS technology and clocked at 300 MHz sampling frequency, the proposed SAB-based modulator achieves a 67.2 dB SNDR and a 69.3 dB SNR in an 8.5 MHz signal bandwidth. The overall CTDSM dissipates 4.3 mW and achieves a figure-of-merit of 135 fJ/conversion-step.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2679-2689}, 
abstract={Implementation of highly integrated optical receivers in CMOS promises low cost, but combining high gain, low noise, high bandwidth, and low power in a CMOS transimpedance amplifier is a challenge. Fortunately, the sensitivity of an optical receiver is improved by limiting its frontend bandwidth far below the symbol rate and using equalization to eliminate the resulting intersymbol interference (ISI). Analysis reveals that when using a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to cancel all postcursor ISI, receiver sensitivity is optimized by taking a front-end bandwidth as low as 0.12 fbit, depending upon the frequency response and noise spectrum assumed for the front end. This paper presents a 20 Gb/s optical receiver with a front-end bandwidth of 3 GHz. The front end is designed to have an approximately first-order response, ensuring only postcursor ISI, which may be efficiently canceled with a first-order infinite-impulse response DFE (IIR-DFE). An IIR-DFE circuit is also proposed that obviates the need for an explicit full-rate multiplexor. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the receiver achieves 0.705 pJ/b efficiency with the IIR-DFE consuming 150 fJ/b. Using a photodiode with 12 GHz analog bandwidth and responsivity of 0.5 A/W, the receiver has a sensitivity of -5.8 dBm optically modulated amplitude.},

abstract={The first integrated CMOS monolithic sensor system for on-chip capacitive detection of micrometric airborne particulate matter (PM) is presented. The chip is based on a 32 channel lock-in architecture allowing a dust collection area of 1.15 mm2 where interdigitated differential microelectrodes, fabricated with the top metal and directly exposed to air, allow single particle sensitivity. The preamplifier input capacitance is significantly minimized thanks to the electrode-amplifier proximity and proper partitioning of the sensing area, in order to reduce the noise. Each channel comprises a charge preamplifier with adjustable high-pass filtering for flicker noise shaping, square-wave mixer, gm-C tunable low-pass filter (40-750 Hz), and a 6 bit digital network for automatic compensation of electrodes mismatching with a granularity of 150 aF. Thanks to the capacitive noise of only 65 zF rms with 25 ms temporal resolution, deposition events of single mineral talc particles were recorded down to 1 μm diameter with a signal-to-noise ratio of ≈18 dB. This chip paves the way to pervasive mapping of both indoor and outdoor PM in the 1-30 μm range.},

abstract={AMD's 6th generation “Carrizo” APU, targeted at 12-35 W mobile computing form factors, contains 3.1 billion transistors, occupies 250.04 mm 2 and is implemented in a 28 nm HKMG planar dual-oxide FET technology with 12 metal layers. The design achieves a 29% improvement in transistor density compared to the 5th generation “Kaveri” APU, also a 28 nm design, and implements several power management features resulting in area and power improvements similar to a technology shrink. Increased power density makes meeting the thermal limits required for reliability and power distribution to the APU's processors substantial design challenges. Pre-silicon thermal analysis is used to understand and take advantage of thermal gradients. Adaptive voltage-frequency scaling in the processor core as well as wordline and bitline assist techniques in the L2 cache enable lower minimum voltage requirements.},

abstract={A novel class of mono-stable static physically unclonable functions (PUFs) for secure key generation and chip identification is proposed. The fundamental concept is demonstrated through a 65 nm prototype that contains two different implementations, as well as several previously proposed PUFs to enable a fair comparison at iso-technology. From a statistical quality viewpoint, the achieved reproducibility and uniqueness are quantified by an intra-PUF Hamming distance (HD) lower than 1 and an inter-PUF HD of 128.35, for a 256-bit PUF output key. The keys generated by the proposed PUF pass all applicable NIST randomness tests. The measured energy per bit is as low as 15 fJ/bit. Native unstable bits are less than 2% at nominal conditions, less than 5% at 0.6-1 V and less than 6% in worst case scenario of 0.6 V voltage and 85 °C temperature, before applying any further post-silicon technique for stability enhancement.},

abstract={A model for voltage-based time-interleaved sampling is introduced with two implementations of highly interleaved analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for 100 Gb/s communication systems. The model is suitable for ADCs where the analog input bandwidth is of concern and enables a tradeoff between different architectures with respect to the analog input bandwidth, the hold time of the sampled signal, and constraints on the clock path. The two ADCs at 6 and 8 b resolution implement inline demux sampling with 32χ and 64χ interleaving to achieve 36 GS/s at 110 mW and 90 GS/s at 667 mW, respectively. The analog input bandwidth of both ADCs exceeds 20 GHz. The SNDR of the 64χ interleaved ADC is above 36 dB up to 6.1 GHz and above 33 dB up to 19.9 GHz at 90 GS/s, and the SNDR of the 32χ interleaved ADC exceeds 31.6 dB up to Nyquist at 36 GS/s.

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={1}, 
pages={187-195}, 
abstract={This paper presents an energy-efficient readout circuit for micro-machined resonant sensors. It operates by briefly exciting the sensor at a frequency close to its resonance frequency, after which resonance frequency and quality factor are determined from a single ring-down transient. The circuit employs an inverter-based trans-impedance amplifier to sense the ring-down current, with a programmable feedback network to enable the readout of different resonant sensors. An inverter-based comparator with dynamically-adjusted threshold levels tracks the ring-down envelope to measure quality factor, and detects zero crossings to measure resonance frequency. The excitation frequency is dynamically adjusted to accommodate large resonance frequency shifts. Experimental results obtained with a prototype fabricated in 0.35 μm standard CMOS technology and three different SiN resonators are in good agreement with conventional impedance analysis. The prototype achieves a frequency resolution better than 30 ppm while consuming less than 80 nJ/meas from a 1.8 V supply, which is 7.8x less than the state-of-the-art.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51},

pages={2596-2609}, 
abstract={A 320 GHz fully integrated terahertz imaging system is reported. The system is composed of a phase-locked high-power transmitter and a coherent high-sensitivity subharmonic-mixing receiver, which are fabricated using a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology (fT/fmax = 220/280 GHz). To enhance the imaging sensitivity, a heterodyne coherent detection scheme is utilized. To obtain frequency coherency, fully integrated phase-locked loops are implemented on both the transmitter and receiver chips. According to the measurement results, consuming a total dc power of 605 mW, the transmitter chip achieves a peak radiated power of 2 mW and a peak EIRP of 21.1 dBm. The receiver chip achieves an equivalent incoherent responsivity of more than 7.26 MV/Wand a sensitivity of 70.1 pW under an integration bandwidth of 1 kHz, with a total dc power consumption of 117 mW. The achieved sensitivity with this proposed coherent imaging transceiver is around ten times better compared with other state-of-the-art incoherent imagers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper demonstrates the first fully integrated coherent terahertz imaging transceiver on silicon.},

The presented prototype, fabricated in 0.13 μm CMOS technology, occupies an active area of 0.2 mm2. A maximum TX efficiency of 17.5% is achieved while the TX is delivering an output power of -1 dBm at 2.45 GHz. A phase noise of -129 dBc/Hz at 2.5 MHz frequency offset results in a carrier-frequency drift below 7 Hz/s and an FSK error below 0.7%, which allows the transmitter to operate in open-loop while delivering long data-packets. The transmitter is also compliant to BLE specifications when FSK and GFSK modulations with index of 0.5 are applied.},

abstract={First-ever 28 nm embedded split-gate MONOS (SG-MONOS) flash macros have been developed to increase memory capacity embedded in micro controller units and to improve performance over wide junction temperature range from -40°C to 170 °C as demanded strongly in automotive uses. Much attention has been paid to the degradation of the reliability characteristics along with the process shrinkage. Temperature-adjusted word-line overdrive scheme improves random read access frequency by 15% and realizes both of 6.4 GB/s read throughput by 200 MHz no-wait random access of code flash macros and more than ten times longer TDDB lifetime of WL drivers. Temperature-adaptive step pulse erase control (TASPEC) improves the TDDB lifetime of dielectric films between metal interconnect layers by three times. TASPEC is particularly useful for a data flash macro with one million rewrite cycles. Source-side injection (SSI) program with negative back-bias voltage achieves 63% reduction of program pulse time and, consequently, realizes 2.0 MB/s write throughput of code flash macros. A spread spectrum clock generation and a clock phase shift technique are introduced for charge pump clock generation in order to suppress EMI noise due to high write throughput of code flash macros, and peak power of EMI noise is reduced by 19 dB.},

The proposed hybrid ADC combines a low-noise fine digital-slope ADC with a low-power coarse SAR ADC. The coarse SAR ADC rapidly approximates the input signal and produces a small residue signal for the succeeding fine ADC. The fine digital-slope ADC linearly approaches the small residue signal. A prototype was fabricated in 1P8M 28 nm CMOS technology. At 100 MS/s, the ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 64.43 dB and a spurious free dynamic range of 75.42 dB at the Nyquist input frequency while consuming 0.35 mW from a 0.9 V supply. The resultant Walden and Schreier figures of merit are 2.6 fJ/conversion-step and 176.0 dB, respectively. The ADC occupies an active area of 66 μm × 71 μm.},

abstract={A highly reliable wireless solid-state drive (SSD) system for future applications of large volume storage is presented. The wireless interface in the system consists of an inductively coupled power link with fast transmission power control and high-speed data links using transmission line couplers (TLCs). The wireless power link can deliver 1 W from the host to the SSD. The full duplex wireless data interface achieves raw data rate of 1.6 Gb/s. The reliability of the wireless interface is studied though simulation analysis and experiments. The error correction block for the NAND flash memory system can also correct errors in the wireless data links, allowing the requirements for the PHY layer to be relaxed. The error correction code is discussed, including optimization by analyzing the error bits on the wireless data links. The experimental results confirmed strong tolerance to the interference from the power link on the wireless data link, and the water proof property of both the data and power links.},

This is performed using the captured data and depends on the presence or absence of differences between normal images and reference images.

abstract={A touch system sensing pen-pressure of the proposed electrically coupled resonance (ECR) pen is implemented, which can replace costly digitizer system containing electro magnetic resonance (EMR) and capacitive touch system. The proposed system detects the location of the ECR pen and finger using proposed position sensor, and senses pen-pressure of ECR pen using proposed pen-pressure sensor. For the position sensor, to detect even small variation of the mutual capacitance on touch screen panel (TSP) of the pen, a simultaneous driving scheme is proposed with modified Hadamard matrix, resulting in highly increased dynamic range and SNR. In the proposed pen-pressure sensor, the resonant frequency of the ECR pen is measured by a frequency to voltage converter based sensor. The measured SNR for the pen position is 49 dB with 1 mm φ metal pillar, and 6.5-bit resolution is achieved for pen-pressure sensor in 6σ criteria.},

abstract={We present a novel frequency tracking method that exploits the dynamics of injection locking in a quadrature ring oscillator to increase the effective locking range from 5% (7-7.4 GHz) to 90% (4-11 GHz). The quadrature phase error between I and Q phases of an injection locked ring oscillator is derived and shown to contain frequency error information, both inside and outside the locking range. This error is utilized to form a first-order frequency tracking quadrature locked loop (QLL). This loop generates accurate clock phases for a 4-channel parallel optical receiver using a forwarded clock at quarter-rate. The QLL drives an ILO at each channel without any repeaters for local quadrature clock generation. Each local ILO has deskew capability for phase alignment. The receiver maintains a constant energy-per-bit consumption across 16-32 Gb/s by adaptive body biasing in a 28 nm FDSOI technology.},

In this paper, we also outline two search schemes, referred to as dynamic source-line pulse controlled (DSL-PC) search and dataline-pulse controlled (DL-PC) search, which were developed specifically for the RCSD-4T2R nvTCAM. We fabricated a 128 × 32 b RCSD-4T2R nvTCAM macro with HfO ReRAM using a 180 nm CMOS process.

pages={2522-2533}, 
abstract={A fully integrated 3-D ultrasonic fingerprint sensor-on-a-chip is presented. The device consists of a 110× 56 piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) array bonded at the wafer level to custom readout electronics fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with a HV (24 V) transistor option. With the 24 V driving signal strength, the sensor consumes 280 μJ to image a 4.73 mm × 3.24 mm section of a fingerprint at a rate of 380 fps. A wakeup mode that detects the presence of a finger at 4 fps and dissipates 10 μW allows the proposed sensor to double as a power switch. The sensor is capable of imaging both the surface epidermal and subsurface dermal fingerprints and is insensitive to contaminations, including perspiration or oil. The 3-D imaging capability combined with the sensor's sensitivity to the acoustic properties of the tissue translates into excellent robustness against spoofing attacks.},

year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1436-1445}, 
abstract={This work proposes a feed-forward PWM-intermodulated-distortion reduction (FFPIDR) technique for closed-loop class-D audio amplifiers. The proposed FFPIDR technique overcomes the trade-off between out-of-band loop attenuation and in-band loop gain to reduce the PWM-intermodulated distortion while maintaining a high in-band distortion suppression capability without increasing the switching frequency. This results in a high-fidelity and low-quiescent-current audio amplifier suitable for mobile devices. This work is implemented in a 0.5 μm CMOS technology, and the measurement result with a 4.2 V supply voltage shows that the proposed FFPIDR technique improves the TiD + N by 12 dB when an output power of 340 mW is delivered to an 8-Ω load. Compared with other state of the arts, the proposed class-D amplifier achieves 0.0037% TiD + N with a quiescent current of 2.4 mA and the smallest chip area of 0.86 mm2, and the measured peak efficiency reaches 92%.},

abstract={In this paper, a CMOS biosensor integrated circuit (IC) focusing on dielectric relaxations of biological water with 120 and 60 GHz oscillator arrays is proposed. To realize label-free biosensing, we focus on frequencies around 100 GHz where changes in the dielectric constant of water become prominent as many a water molecule is bound to biomolecules. To detect the state of the biological water, sensing elements based on LC-oscillators operating at 120 and 60 GHz are realized using the 65 nm CMOS process. The sizes of the sensing elements are significantly smaller than the wavelengths of the operating frequencies, therefore 2-D arrays can be implemented in a chip. The trial chip enables us to obtain spatial distributions of the targets. In this paper, the cultivated bacterial colony growth is monitored and other biosensing applications are explained, which showcase possibilities for using the biosensor IC.},

title={A PVT-Robust and Low-Jitter Ring-VCO-Based Injection-Locked Clock Multiplier With a Continuous Frequency-Tracking Loop Using a Replica-Delay Cell and a Dual-Edge Phase Detector}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1878-1889}, 
abstract={A low-jitter, ring-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) with a continuous frequency-tracking loop (FTL) for process-voltagetemperature (PVT)-calibration is presented. Using a single replica-delay cell of the VCO that provides the intrinsic phase information of the free-running VCO, the proposed FTL can continuously track and correct frequency drifts. Therefore, the proposed ILCM can calibrate real-time frequency drifts due to voltage or temperature variations as well as static frequency deviations due to process variations. Since the FTL provided an additional filtering of in-band VCO noise, the ILCM was able to achieve excellent jitter performance over the PVT variations, while it was based on a ring-VCO. The proposed ILCM was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. When injection locked, the RMS-jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 40 MHz of the 1.20 GHz output signal was 185 fs. The proposed PVT-calibrator regulated the degradations of jitter to less than 5% and 7% over temperatures and supply voltages, respectively. The active area was 0.06 mm2 and total power consumption was 9.5 mW.},

title={A Time-Interleaved Ring-VCO with Reduced 1/ $\text {f}^{3}$ Phase Noise Corner, Extended Tuning Range and Inherent Divided Output}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={51}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2979-2991}, 
abstract={This paper describes a time-interleaved (TI) ring-VCO (RVCO) exhibiting an improved phase noise over a wide range of frequency offsets, an extended tuning range and an inherent divided output. Such features are achieved by substantially increasing the number of delay stages in a RVCO, such that the rich multi-phase sub-outputs can be combined through a time-interleaved method, generating a high-frequency output with a significantly lowered 1/f3 phase noise corner (f1/f3). The critical block is the phase combiner, which features a timing window to minimize the delay offset and mismatch. A reconfigurable TI factor extends the tuning range over the same range of supply voltage (VDD). The prototype is a 35-stage dual-mode TI-RVCO occupying 0.003 mm2 in 65 nm CMOS, and has a selectable TI factor of 5 and 7. The measured f1/f3 is 150 kHz at 3.47 GHz, which is 6.2× less than that of a typical 5-stage RVCO. The tuning range covers 1.7 to 3.5 GHz (68.5%) over VDD = 0.7 to 1 V. The multi-phase sub-outputs are the inherent divided output (÷ 5 or ÷ 7) that can be directly utilized in a PLL to save area and power.},

year={2010},

pages={411-421}, 
abstract={In this paper, VLSI implementation of a configurable, soft-output MIMO detector is presented. The proposed chip can support up to 8 × 8 64-QAM spatial multiplexing MIMO communications, which surpasses all reported MIMO detector ICs in antenna number and modulation order. Moreover, this chip provides configurable antenna number from 2 × 2 up to 8 × 8 and modulation order from QPSK to 64-QAM. Its outputs include bit-wise log likelihood ratios (LLRs) and a candidate list, making it compatible with powerful soft-input channel decoders and iterative decoding system. The MIMO detector adopts a novel sphere decoding algorithm with high decoding efficiency and superior error rate performance, called modified best-first with fast descent (MBF-FD). Moreover, a low-power pipelined quad-dual-heap (quad-DEAP) circuit for efficient node pool management and several circuit techniques are implemented in this chip. When this chip is configured as 4 × 4 64-QAM and 8 × 8 64-QAM soft-output MIMO detectors, it achieves average throughputs of 431.8 Mbps and 428.8 Mbps with only 58.2 mW and 74.8 mW respective power consumption and reaches 10-5 coded bit error rate (BER) at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 24.2 dB and 22.6 dB, respectively.},

abstract={A 5 mm2 transceiver front-end suitable for a software-defined radio (SDR) platform is implemented in a 40-nm LP digital CMOS technology. Tailored for all modern communication standards relevant for a modern handheld mobile device (2G/3G/4G cellular, WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, broadcasting, etc.), it uses radio architectures and circuits that ensure flexible performance at a minimal cost in area and power consumption. The receive section features four parallel LNAs to cover the frequency range from 100 MHz up to 6 GHz, a 25 % duty cycle passive mixer with IIP2 calibration, fifth-order baseband filtering up to 20 MHz, variable-gain amplification, and a 10-b 65 MS/s 34 fj/conv-step SAR ADC. It achieves NF down to 2.4 dB, more than 30-dB EVM and 50-dBm IIP2. In the transmit section, main emphasis is given to the out-of-band noise requirement that enables SAW-less operation in FDD systems: a flexible reconstruction filter is followed by a voltage-sampling mixer and a variable gain PPA. The TX chain achieves 3.2% EVM at 0-dBm output power, with CNR down to-156 dBc/Hz. For frequency synthesis, two dual-VCO 5.9-12.8 GHz fractional-N PLLs are implemented together with a chain of divide-by-2 circuits for quadrature generation.},

abstract={We present an all-digital measurement circuit that enables wafer-level test and characterization of phase-locked loop (PLL) response. Through modifications only in the PLL feedback divider state machine, this technique facilitates accurate estimation of PLL frequency-domain closed-loop bandwidth and gain peaking by respectively measuring the time-domain crossover time and maximum overshoot of phase error to a self-induced phase step in the feedback clock. These transient measurements are related back to bandwidth and peaking through the proportionality relationships of crossover time to reciprocal bandwidth and maximum overshoot to peaking. The design-for-test circuit can be used to generate a transient plot of step response, measure static phase error, and observe phase-lock status. We report silicon results from two demonstration vehicles built in a 45-nm SOI-CMOS logic technology for high-performance microprocessors.},

An integrated voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with 34% tuning range and a set of high-speed dividers are used to accomplish all the frequencies. To achieve a wide tuning range while keeping a low gain and a low phase noise, the VCO employs digitally controlled sub-bands.

abstract={A 250 MHz analog baseband chain for ultra-wideband was implemented in a 1.2 V 0.13 Â¿ m CMOS process. The chip has an active area of 0.8 mm2.

Besides, a current-mode Sallen-Key low-pass filter is adopted for effective rejection of out-of-band interferers. A 6 th-order Chebyshev low-pass filter realized in Gm-C topology is designed in the baseband chain for channel selection. Digitally-assisted DC-offset calibration improves second-order distortion of the entire chain. The design achieves a maximum gain of 73 dB and a dynamic range of 82 dB. Measured noise figure is 14 dB, an IIP3 of -6 dBV, and IIP2 of -5 dBV at the maximum gain mode. The analog baseband chain consumes 56.4 mA under supply of 1.2 V.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={2}, 
pages={368-379}, 
abstract={In cascaded ΔΣ modulators (DSMs), the quantization noise of the earlier stage leaks to the output unless completely cancelled by the digital noise cancellation filter (NCF). The noise leakage is worse in the continuous-time (CT) implementation due to the poorly controlled time constant of the analog loop filter. A parameter-based continuous-time to discrete-time transform is developed to get an exact digital NCF, and the analog filter time constant is calibrated to match with the digital NCF. A binary pulse tone is injected into the quantizer to detect the filter time-constant error, and eliminated by zero-forcing its residual power based on the adaptive least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. A 2-1-1 cascaded CT-DSM prototype in 0.18-μm CMOS demonstrates that the spectral density of the leaked noise is lower than 10 nV/¿Hz after the capacitors in the Gm-C loop filters are trimmed with 1.1% step. With a 1-Vpp full-scale input, it achieves a dynamic range of 68 dB within 18-MHz bandwidth at an over-sampling ratio of 10. The analog core and the digital logic occupy 1.27 mm2,and consume 230 mW at 1.8 V.},

abstract={Building on the technique of correlated level shifting (CLS), Split-CLS is introduced as a viable way to enable the design of high performance, high resolution A/D converters in deep submicron CMOS processes. One possible implementation of Split-CLS is presented, which achieves very high effective gain, and combines the fast, high efficiency charging of a zero-crossing based circuit (ZCBC) with the high-accuracy, low power settling of a double-cascode telescopic opamp. A dynamic zero-crossing detector (ZCD) conserves power in the ZCBC by only creating high bandwidth in the ZCD near the zero-crossing instant. Measured results are presented from a pipelined A/D converter fabricated in 0.18 m CMOS. Using the Split-CLS structure, an opamp with 300 mV output swing is used to produce a pipeline stage output swing of 1.4 V. The proof-of-concept test chip achieves 68.3 dB SNDR (11.1b ENOB) and 76.3dB SFDR while sampling at 20 MHz, and consumes 17.2 mW at 1.8 V supply.},

abstract={We present an electrical distributed parametric oscillator to realize a passive CMOS frequency divider with low phase noise. Instead of using active devices, which are the main sources of noise and power consumption, an oscillation at half of the input frequency is sustained by the parametric process based on nonlinear interaction with the input signal. To show the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have implemented a 20-GHz frequency divider in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. Without any dc power consumption, 600-mV differential output amplitude is achieved for an input amplitude of 600 mV. The input frequency ranges from 18.5 to 23.5 GHz with varactor tuning. The output phase noise is almost 6 dB lower than that of the input signal for all offset frequencies up to 1 MHz. There is a good agreement among analysis, simulation, and 10-MHz measurement results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first passive frequency divider in a CMOS process.},

The 2.9 × 1.4 mm2 chip consumes a total of 590 mW from a 1-V supply when driving all four channels at a maximum saturated output power of 11 dBm, with 20 dB gain per transmitter. Carrier leakage varies between - 20.5 dBc ±0.5 dB and sideband rejection is 25 to 28 dBc among the four transmitters when measured on the same die. The measured phase noise is 1.7 ± 1 dB higher than the theoretical 21.6 dB increase in the phase noise due to 12 X frequency multiplication of the injected LO.

abstract={The iterative design of an integrated subharmonic receiver for 120-127 GHz is presented.

The input 1 dB compression point is at - 40 dBm. The receiver draws 139 mA from a supply voltage of 3.3 V. A subsequent design demonstrates 31 dB differential gain at 122 GHz, and 11 dB NF. The 3 dB bandwidth is from 121 GHz to 124 GHz. The receiver has a NF of 8 dB for 3 GHz IF frequency due to integrated RF bandpass-filtering.

abstract={UHF RFID reader transceiver for Chinese local standard (840-845 MHz and 920-925 MHz), in concord with the protocols of EPC Class-1 Gen-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-6C, is presented. A highly linear RF front-end with low flicker noise, an on-chip self-jammer cancellation (SC) circuit with fast time-varying cut-off frequency and a DC-offset cancellation (DCOC) circuit are proposed to deal with the large self-jammer in the receiver. In the presence of 22 dBm PA output power, the receiver achieves a sensitivity of -79 dBm including the 15 dB loss of the directional coupler. A CMOS class-AB PA is integrated in the transmitter, with 22 dBm output power and 35% PAE. The spectrum mask achieves ACPR1 of -45 dBc and ACPR2 of -60 dBc . A sigma-delta fractional-N PLL with a single LC VCO is also implemented for good phase noise (-126 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz offset) and high frequency resolution within 1 kHz. This single-chip is fabricated in a 0.18 standard CMOS process. It occupies a silicon area of 13.5 mm2 and dissipates 203 mW from a 1.8 V supply voltage when transmitting 7.5 dBm output power.},

abstract={Wireless environments, high data rates and increased digitization require A/D converters with high dynamic range and large bandwidth at the lowest possible power consumption. A fully flexible continuous-time (CT) Δ Σ with programmable bandwidth, resolution and power consumption in 1.2 V 90 nm CMOS is presented able to satisfy those demands. By introducing flexibility into the core building blocks, a DR of 67/72/78/83 dB is achieved in maximum performance mode for WLAN, DVB, UMTS and BT for a power consumption of 6.8/5.5/6.4/5.0 mW, respectively. GSM operation is also feasible with a DR of 87 dB. For a given bandwidth, the flexibility allows to obtain the lowest power consumption for a desired performance. The overall energy efficiency is reached with a single-bit CT Δ Σ modulator avoiding high speed DEM circuits. Its low power consumption especially for high bandwidths is realized thanks to architecture and circuit level optimization. Linearity enhanced integrators, a threshold configurable comparator enabling loop delay compensation and optimized DAC implementations for jitter and avoiding signal dependency in the feedback pulses due to a large voltage swing are employed to increase the performance. The respective FOM equals 0.24/0.27/0.41/0.85 pJ per conversion.},

A bandwidth-tracking technique that uses replica delay cells in the DCO and the phase detector (PD) is introduced to enable stable operation across the frequency range without calibration. Measurement results show that the DPLL achieves an output frequency up to 1.8 GHz in a 65-nm CMOS technology.

pages={1061-1071}, 
abstract={An architectural solution for designing and implementing low THD oscillators is presented. A digital harmonic-cancellation-block is used to suppress the low-frequency harmonics while a passive, inherently linear, filter is used to suppress the high-frequency ones. The proposed technique eliminates the need for typical high-Q BPF to suppress the harmonics. Thus, eradicates the effect of increasing device nonlinearities in the nanometric technologies by having pure digital solution. In addition, eliminating the need for high-Q band-pass-filter (BPF) releases the output swing from the constraints imposed by the linearity of the filter. The prototype is fabricated in 0.13 ¿¿m CMOS technology. Measurement results show -72 dB THD at 10 MHz along with a differential output swing of 228 mVpp. The oscillator prototype can be tuned from 5 MHz to 11 MHz with less than 4.5 dB variations in the THD. The circuit consumes 3.37 mA from 1.2 V supply at 10 MHz and occupies an area of 0.186 mm2. As the performance depends solely on the timing precision of digital signals, the proposed oscillator is considered the best time-mode-based oscillator in literature.},

abstract={A highly flexible receiver chain based on RF-sampling and discrete-time signal processing in the charge domain for SDR applications is presented. A compact switched-inductor variable-gain front-end provides multiband low noise amplification and RF-selectivity with reduced area penalties. Strong selectivity at RF was obtained through a novel discrete-time decimating bandpass filter with triangular weighted filter taps. Decimation filters with programmable number of taps offer flexible rate decimation. A power scalable discrete-time baseband filter was implemented in-order to minimize static power consumption. The 90-nm digital CMOS implementation achieves a noise figure of 5.1 dB, a variable gain range of more than 60 dB with +1 dBm IIP3 and +50 dBm IIP2. This is achieved for power figures competitive with dedicated solutions. The receiver, frequency synthesizer excluded, occupies only 0.5 mm2 .},

abstract={This paper describes a digital baseband designed for use in a non-coherent IR-UWB system. Owing to the nonlinear statistics introduced by the energy-sampling RF front-end, the baseband employs a new quadratic correlation technique that achieves comparable performance to a matched filter classifier, with the added benefit of being robust to SNR estimation errors. Additionally, “alias-free codes” are introduced that allow for pulse-level synchronization accuracy without requiring any increase in front-end complexity. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the digital baseband utilizes significant parallelism in addition to clock and data gating to achieve low-power operation, with supply voltages as low as 0.55 V. At a clock frequency of 32 MHz, the baseband requires 14-to-79 μs to process a preamble during which it consumes an average power of 1.6 mW, while payload demodulation requires 12 pJ/bit.},

abstract={Spread spectrum clocking is an effective solution to reduce the electromagnetic interference produced by digital chips, using a clock signal with a frequency that is intentionally swept (frequency modulated) within a certain frequency range, with a predefined modulation profile. We present the implementation of an all-digital spread spectrum clock generator. The circuit is realized by using a design flow completely based on standard cells and is able to perform clock spreading with an arbitrary modulation profile and a modulation frequency up to 5 MHz. The circuit uses two digitally controlled delay lines driven by a digital modulator to synthesize the output waveform. A replica delay line is employed in a real-time measurement circuit to track process, voltage and temperature variations. A chip has been implemented in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The chip is able to generate signals up to 1.27 GHz. The measured peak level reduction of the clock spectrum, at 750 MHz output frequency, is 20.5 dB with a 6% modulation depth. The power dissipation is 44 mW @ 1.27 GHz.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1575-1589}, 
abstract={This paper proposes the use of N-push operation for combining the functions of the VCO and divider in the mm-wave frequency range. If employed in a PLL, the combined VCO/divider (C-VCO/D) would potentially provide wider tuning range than traditional mm-wave PLLs employing injection locked frequency dividers, thus exploiting the full range available in the 60 GHz band (57 GHz-64 GHz). The behavior of triple push oscillators based on injection locking theory is analyzed to study their various oscillation modes, their stability and the effect of mismatch on the oscillator performance. Design guidelines are provided for boosting the third harmonic power at a given power budget. Using 130 nm IBM CMOS technology, multiple versions of the triple push oscillator are implemented and characterized. A 55 GHz-65 GHz tuning range is obtained using a 206 pH tank inductance and requires Icore = 20 mA, and Ibuffer = 15 mA from a 1.4 V supply. For a tank inductance of 140 pH, a 63.2 GHz-72.4 GHz tuning range is obtained using Icore = 17 mA, and Ibuffer = 18 mA with a phase noise of -91 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz from the 63.2 GHz carrier and -95 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz from the 72.4 GHz carrier.},

pages={640-651}, 
abstract={Increased variation in CMOS processes due to scaling results in greater reliance on accurate variation models in developing circuit methods to mitigate variation. This paper investigates spatial variation in digital circuit performance: we describe a test-chip in 90 nm CMOS containing all-digital measurement circuits capable of extracting accurate variation data. Specifically, we use replicated 64-bit Kogge-Stone adders, ring oscillators (ROs) of varying gate type and stage length and an all-digital, sub-picosecond resolution delay measurement circuit to provide this data. Measurement data from the test-chips indicate that 1) relative variation is significantly larger in low-voltage domains, 2) within-die variation is spatially uncorrelated, and 3) die-to-die (or global) variation is strongly correlated, but degrades toward uncorrelated as the power-supply voltage is lowered. Lastly, extended analysis of the data reveals that systematic effects such as layout pattern dependencies or circuit structure can be misinterpreted as random but spatially-correlated variation. This suggests that circuit designers will reap more benefit from design tools capable of modeling systematic, position-dependent variation rather than spatially correlated, distance-dependent variation.},

In addition, digital calibration with digital feedback channel which calibrates the output dc voltage enables the removal of calibration circuits on the DUT.

abstract={A ferroelectric (Fe)-NAND flash memory with a batch write algorithm and a smart data store to the nonvolatile page buffer is proposed. An enterprise solid-state drive (SSD) for a data center is a future promising market of NAND flash memories. The critical problem for such an enterprise SSD is a slow random write. The write unit in a NAND flash memory is a page, 4-8 KBytes. Because the minimum write unit of the operating system is a sector, 512 Bytes, a random write to write a smaller data than a page size frequently happens, which creates a garbage. As a garbage accumulates, a garbage collection is performed to increase a workable memory capacity. The garbage collection takes as much as 100 ms, which is 100 times longer than a page program time, 800 μs, and thus causes a serious performance degradation. In the proposed Fe-NAND flash memory, the data fragmentation in a random write is removed by introducing a batch write algorithm where a page buffer in the Fe-NAND flash memory temporarily stores a program data. The memory cell program starts after the program data as much as the page size accumulates in page buffers. As the data fragmentation is eliminated, the SSD performance can double. In addition, the nonvolatile page buffer realizes a power-outage-immune highly reliable operation. With a low program/erase voltage of 6 V and a high endurance of 100 million cycles, the proposed Fe-NAND flash memory is most suitable for a highly reliable highspeed low-power data-center-application enterprise SSD.},

abstract={A time-of-flight depth sensor is presented employing a correlation based concept. The pixels are able to suppress contributions of ambient light up to 150 klx autonomously and directly in the electronic circuits consuming only 2 μA, each. All 16 × 16 pixels capture the depth information simultaneously at maximally 16 frames per second using an external A/D converter (ADC). Additionally, an embedded 12-bit ADC can be used for converting the analog output values of the pixels to the digital domain at lower frame rates. Distance measurements in a range of 0-3.2 m show standard deviations in the centimeter range and a linearity error within -1/+2 cm. The influence of extraneous light is expressed as a relative distance error which is also in the centimeter range. A complete impression of the sensor system is given by discussing the pixel circuits, the ADC design, the design of the modulated light source providing 0.9 W optical power in the near infrared, and the auxiliary setup including an FPGA board. Additionally, a sensor model is provided to predict the measurement error due to stochastic sources. Three-dimensional snapshots as well as a comparison with state-of-the-art sensors and products complete the paper.},

pages={2445-2456}, 
abstract={A ΔΣ DLL targeted for clock synchronization has been proposed. Unlike other existing ΔΣ DLL designs, the proposed DLL makes use of the ΔΣ dithering in the feedback path rather than at the input, which eliminates the need of additional multi-phase generator, and hence simplifies the architecture and improves the jitter performance. It also employs a second order adaptive filter to achieve dynamic loop bandwidth control for different operating frequencies as well as a unique antiharmonic detector to avoid false locking. Clock synchronization is achieved in two steps. During the coarse tuning step, the delay edge from DLL that closely matched to the incoming clock is first determined. In subsequent fine tuning step, a successive approximation method is then employed to quickly shift the selected delay edge to achieve synchronization with the incoming clock. Fabricated in 0.35 μ m CMOS technology, the ΔΣ DLL core can operate from 50 to 250 MHz with a delay step resolution of 15 ps and occupy only 0.4 mm2. It draws about 6.9 mA from 3 V supply at 200 MHz and exhibits an rms jitter of 2.1 ps.},

Each receiver, optimized for power efficiency, consists of a low-power linear equalizer, four offset-cancelled quantizers for 1:4 demultiplexing, and an injection-locked ring oscillator coupled to a low-voltage swing, global clock distribution. Measurement results show a 6.4-7.2 Gb/s data rate with BER < 10-12 across 14 cm of PCB, and also an 8.0 Gb/s data rate through 4 cm of PCB. Designed in a 1.2 V, 90 nm CMOS process, the ILRO achieves a wide tuning range from 1.6-2.6 GHz.

pages={2104-2115}, 
abstract={The advent of wideband systems, e.g., software defined radios, cognitive radios and UWB technology, motivates research for new transceiver architectures and circuit topologies to arrive at compact and low power solutions. Reference frequency generation in wideband CMOS receivers is usually power and area hungry. In this paper a wide band quadrature demodulator, based on mixers reconfigurable between fundamental and sub-harmonic operation modes is presented. The technique allows covering an RF bandwidth three times larger than the frequency covered by the synthesizer. Multiple local oscillator phases are required for the proposed architecture. For low phase noise and fast settling time, they are generated by means of a multi-stage injection locked ring oscillator. This solution proves very accurate and power efficient and may find applications in other communication systems requiring multiple phase references. A demodulator test chip tailored to WiMedia UWB groups 1, 3, 4 (3.1-9.5 GHz), and comprising mixers and frequency synthesizer, has been realized in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show 10 dB of conversion gain with 2.3 nV/sqrt(Hz) equivalent input noise voltage spectral density. IIP2 and IIP3, with interferers in the GSM and WLAN bands, are 40 dBm and 11 dBm respectively. The synthesizer displays maximum spurs level of -43 dBc, a state of the art phase noise of -128 dBc/Hz@10 MHz offset and a settling time of less than 6 ns with 43 m W only.},

abstract={A low power 60-GHz on-off-keying (OOK) receiver has been implemented in a commercial 90 nm RF CMOS process. By employing a novel on-chip antenna together with architecture optimization, the receiver achieves a sensitivity of -47 dBm at a bit-error rate (BER) of less than 10-3. Using a commercial transmitter with transmit power of 1.5 dBm, a transmission distance of 5 cm can be achieved at 1.2 Gbps data rate. In this design, the on-chip antenna minimizes the packaging loss, while energy detection at RF allows architecture simplification. Both techniques contribute to the receiver's low power consumption of 51 mW, excluding test buffers. This leads to a bit energy efficiency of 28 pj/bit at 1.8 Gbps. The total die area is 3.8 mm2 with the on-chip antenna occupying almost half of it.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a new ADDLL for clock synchronization in a SoC, regardless if the clock duty cycle is seriously distorted from 50%. A half-delay-line circuit and an improved successive-approximation-register controller are developed on top of the coarse-fine architecture for fast lock-in, high duty-cycle-distortion tolerant, and low power. Difference-type circuits and the design techniques for reducing the number of active delay cells and suppressing the dithering effect are developed for low jitter. Measurement results show that when operated at 1.0 V, the 55 nm ADDLL has a maximal frequency of 850 MHz with 1.19 ¿¿W/MHz power index, 2 ps p-p jitter, and 6 lock-in cycles.

abstract={This paper presents a pilot-based clock and data recovery (CDR) technique for high-speed serial link applications where a low-amplitude clock signal, i.e., a pilot, is added to the transmit signal. The clock tone is extracted at the receiver using an injection-locked oscillator and is used to drive the receiver front-end samplers. The performance of the CDR technique is demonstrated using a 5 Gbps differential receiver fabricated in a 0.13 μm IBM CMOS technology. The clock and data recovery circuit implementation has an area of 0.171 mm2 and consumes 11.75 mA from a 1.5 V supply voltage at 5 Gbps. The recovered clock peak-to-peak and RMS jitter at 5 Gbps are less than 10 ps (5%UI) and 1.6 ps (0.8%UI), respectively with an effective CDR loop bandwidth of approximately 28 MHz at a bit-error rate (BER) of 10-12 . The proposed technique simplifies the CDR design and provides data and inter-symbol interference (ISI) independent performance with a small ≈5% pilot voltage overhead to the transmitted data signal.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2696-2708}, 
abstract={A software-defined radio (SDR) receiver with baseband programmable RF bandpass filter (BPF) and complex impedance match is presented. The passive mixer-first architecture used here allows the impedance characteristics of the receiver's baseband circuits to be translated to the RF port of the receiver. Tuning the resistance at the baseband port allows for a real impedance match to the antenna. The addition of "complex feedback" between I and Q paths allows for matching to the imaginary component of the antenna impedance. By implementing both real and imaginary components with resistors in feedback around low noise baseband amplifiers, noise figure is also kept low. Tunable sampling capacitors on the baseband side of the passive mixer translate to tunable-Q filters on the RF port which allow for very good out-of-band linearity. Furthermore, the concept of in-band and out-of-band must be redefined as the impedance match and BPF center frequency move with the LO frequency, such that matching and filtering track the receive frequency. Additionally, 8-phase mixing is shown to provide significant benefits such as impedance matching range, rejection of blockers at LO harmonics, and lower noise figure (NF). Measurements from the receiver implemented in 65 nm CMOS show 70 dB of gain, NF as low as 3 dB, and 25 dBm out-of-band IIP3. Furthermore, tunable impedance matching shows that S11 <;- 30 dB can be achieved at any receive frequency from 0.1-1.3 GHz.},

year={2010},

pages={967-978}, 
abstract={A multiband flexible RF-sampling receiver aimed at software-defined radio is presented. The wideband RF sampling function is enabled by a recently proposed discrete-time mixing downconverter. This work exploits a voltage-sensing LNA preceded by a tunable LC pre-filter with one external coil to demonstrate an RF-sampling receiver with low noise figure (NF) and high harmonic rejection (HR). The second-order LC filter provides voltage pre-gain and attenuates the source noise aliasing, and it also improves the HR ratio of the sampling downconverter. The LNA consists of a simple amplifier topology built from inverters and resistors to improve the third-order nonlinearity via an enhanced voltage mirror technique. The RF-sampling receiver employs 8 times oversampling covering 300 to 800 MHz in two RF sub-bands. The chip is realized in 65 nm CMOS and the measured gain across the band is between 22 and 28 dB, while achieving a NF between 0.8 to 4.3 dB. The IIP2 varies between +38 and +49 dBm and the IIP3 between -14 dBm and -9 dBm, and the third and fifth order HR ratios are more than 60 dB. The LNA and downconverter consumes 6 mW, and the clock generator takes 12 mW at 800 MHz RF.},

abstract={An energy-efficient, 3.5-GHz, direct-conversion RF transmitter with integrated 23-dBm, Class-B power amplifier (PA) is fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process for the reliable transmission of 20-MHz bandwidth OFDM signals. Assisted by an integrated feedback path, a two-dimensional, digital look-up table (2-D LUT) adapted by complex gradient-descent algorithms compensates for the I/Q mismatch and memoryless nonlinearities of the whole transmit path, including the severe amplitude and phase distortions of the on-chip PA. Fifth-order Butterworth transmit filters with 34-MHz cutoff frequency sufficiently attenuate the aliases of the 80-MS/s digital-to-analog converters (DACs), while retaining high in-band fidelity without corrupting the predistorted signal. When a 20-MHz, 64-QAM OFDM signal with 9.6-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) was transmitted, the measured average drain efficiency (DE) of the PA was 12.5% at 9.6-dB back-off and 17.5% at 7-dB back-off, and the corresponding error-vector magnitude (EVM) was measured to be - 29.6 dB and - 26.3 dB with equalization, respectively. A peak DE of 55% and a 25-dBm saturated output power were also measured for the same PA in a stand-alone package.},

abstract={Abstract-A wide-range voltage-and-frequency clock synchronizer (WRCS) for maintaining synchronization during dynamic voltage-and-frequency scaling was developed. The key feature of the WRCS is short-range skew measurement based on a predictive-delay-adjustment (PDA) scheme. The short-range skew measurement results in reduction of the area of the WRCS by 77%, that is, the area of the fabricated WRCS in a 40-nm CMOS process is only 5.65 × 10-3 mm2. In the case of large voltage variation (0.8-1.55 V) and wide frequency range (100 MHz-1 GHz), measured skew is suppressed to the lowest percentage yet reported, namely, less than 6.8% of clock period. Moreover, current consumption of the WRCS is only 0.48 mA under 1.1-V 100-MHz operation.},

abstract={This paper describes a time-domain temperature sensor based on a successive approximation algorithm. Without using any bipolar transistor, a temperature sensor composed of a temperature-dependent delay line (TDDL) is utilized to generate a delay proportional to the measured temperature. A binary-weighted adjustable reference delay line (ARDL) is adopted with an effective delay varied by a SAR control logic to approximate the TDDL delay for output coding. For linearity enhancement, a curvature compensation between both delay lines is invented to achieve the best ever accuracy among inverter-delay-based smart temperature sensors. With two-point calibration, a -0.4°C ˜ +0.6°C inaccuracy (3σ) over a 0°C ˜ 90°C temperature operation range has been measured for 23 test chips. With 10 output bits, the proposed sensor achieves a resolution better than 0.1°C and a chip area of 0.6 mm2 in a TSMC 0.35-μm standard digital CMOS process. The sensor's average current consumption is 11.1 μA at a conversion rate of 2 samples/s.},

abstract={A technique is presented for implementing time-interleaved pipelined high-speed digital ΔΣ modulators using standard cells and the tools for digital design (synthesis and automatic place-and-route). Time interleaving allows clocking the standard cell blocks at submultiples of the final sampling rate. The proposed technique relies on inserting additional delays between the cascaded stages of a MASH ΔΣ modulator to reduce the complexity of the time-interleaved implementation and to eliminate any critical path spanning more than one accumulator. These additional delay stages segment the time-interleaved pipeline sections, preventing any coupling among them. The only custom designed block is a high-speed MUX used to multiplex the low-rate bit streams into the final high-rate stream. The widespread use of digital design tools considerably reduces the design time, improving the time-to-market. A prototype second-order MASH ΔΣ modulator has been fabricated in CMOS 45 nm-LP process. Operating at 2.5 GHz, it draws 6.9 mW from the nominal 1.1 V supply, while at 3.3 GHz it draws 11 mW from a 1.2 V supply.},

title={Discrete-Time Mixing Receiver Architecture for RF-Sampling Software-Defined Radio}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={9}, 
pages={1732-1745}, 
abstract={A discrete-time (DT) mixing architecture for RF-sampling receivers is presented. This architecture makes RF sampling more suitable for software-defined radio (SDR) as it achieves wideband quadrature demodulation and wideband harmonic rejection. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part, different downconversion techniques are classified and compared, leading to the definition of a DT mixing concept. The suitability of CT-mixing and RF-sampling receivers to SDR is also discussed. In the second part, we elaborate the DT-mixing architecture, which can be realized by de-multiplexing. Simulation shows a wideband 90° phase shift between I and Q outputs without systematic channel bandwidth limitation. Oversampling and harmonic rejection relaxes RF pre-filtering and reduces noise and interference folding. A proof-of-concept DT-mixing downconverter has been built in 65 nm CMOS, for 0.2 to 0.9 GHz RF band employing 8-times oversampling. It can reject 2nd to 6th harmonics by 40 dB typically and without systematic channel bandwidth limitation. Without an LNA, it achieves a gain of -0.5 to 2.5 dB, a DSB noise figure of 18 to 20 dB, an IIP3 = +10 dBm, and an IIP2 = +53 dBm, while consuming less than 19 mW including multiphase clock generation.},

pages={2239-2249}, 
abstract={Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective way for system-level power saving. However, lowering the supply voltage may cause some concerns including yield loss and speed degradation. This paper presents a fully integrated linear regulator that can dynamically assign the supply voltage of a SRAM cell to improve the read and write margins in a DVFS system. To minimize the timing overhead during mode transitions, this design adopts two separate feedback loops for reference tracking and load regulation. Individual loop optimization makes a fast transient response possible. To verify this concept, a prototype regulator without an external component was designed with a 1.8-V 0.18-μm CMOS. The output voltage could be freely set between 0.9-1.7 V. With a 0.1-V step, the measured rising and falling time was within 10 and 35 ns, respectively. The maximum current efficiency was 94.7% under a 20-mA current loading.},

abstract={A low power burst mode receiver architecture is presented which can be used for AC coupled links where low frequency signal components are attenuated by the channel. The nonlinear path comprises a hysteresis latch that recovers the missing low frequency content and a linear path that boosts the high frequency component by taking advantage of the high pass channel response. By optimally combining them, the front-end recovers NRZ signals up to 13 Gb/s burning only 26 mW in 90 nm CMOS. A low power- and area-efficient clock recovery scheme uses the linear path to injection lock an oscillator. A simple theory and simulation technique for ILO-based receivers is discussed.

abstract={This paper presents a 24-bit 5.0 GHz ultrahigh-speed direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with direct digital modulation capabilities used in a pulse compression radar. This design represents the first DDS RFIC in over-GHz output frequency range with direct digital modulation capabilities. It adopts a ROM-less architecture and has the capabilities for direct digital frequency and phase modulation with 24 bit and 12 bit resolution, respectively. The DDS includes a 24-bit ripple carry adder (RCA) accumulator for phase accumulation, a 12-bit RCA for phase modulation and a 10-bit segmented sine-weighted digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for phase-to-amplitude conversion (PAC) as well as digital-to-analog conversion. The DDS core occupies 3.0 × 2.5 mm2 and consumes 4.7 W of power with a single 3.3 V power supply. This 24-bit DDS has more than 20,000 transistors and achieves a maximum clock frequency of 5.0 GHz. The measured worst case SFDR is 45 dBc under a 5.0 GHz clock frequency and within a 50 MHz bandwidth. At 1.246258914 GHz output frequency, the 50 MHz narrowband SFDR is measured as 82 dBc. The best Nyquist band SFDR is 38 dBc with a 469.360351 MHz output using a 5.0 GHz clock frequency. This DDS was developed in a 0.13 μm SiGe BiCMOS technology with fT/fMAX = 200/250 GHz and tested in a CLCC-68 package.},

pages={1099-1110}, 
abstract={A calibration-free, high-resolution analog-to-digital converter designed for a bioluminescence sensor array employs incremental sigma-delta (ΣΔ) modulation to combine the advantages of oversampling with an input multiplexing capability. The resolution of incremental ΣΔ modulators can be improved significantly by means of a technique similar to extended counting. In the approach proposed in this paper, analog-to-digital conversion is accomplished with a two-step process in which the residual error from a second-order incremental ΣΔ modulator is encoded using a successive approximation ADC. By this means it is possible to achieve enhanced resolution and improved static linearity while maintaining a one-to-one mapping between individual input and output samples. An experimental implementation of the proposed modulator has been integrated in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology. Operating from a 1.8-V supply, it achieves a dynamic range of 90.1 dB and a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 86.3 dB at a conversion rate of 1 MSample/s, with 38.1-mW power consumption.},

abstract={A self-configured body sensor network controller and a high efficiency wirelessly powered sensor are presented for a wearable, continuous health monitoring system. The sensor chip harvests its power from the surrounding health monitoring band using an Adaptive Threshold Rectifier (ATR) with 54.9% efficiency, and it consumes 12 μW to implement an electrocardiogram (ECG) analog front-end and an ADC. The ATR is implemented with a standard CMOS process for low cost. The adhesive bandage type sensor patch is composed of the sensor chip, a Planar-Fashionable Circuit Board (P-FCB) inductor, and a pair of dry P-FCB electrodes. The dry P-FCB electrodes enable long term monitoring without skin irritation. The network controller automatically locates the sensor position, configures the sensor type (self-configuration), wirelessly provides power to the configured sensors, and transacts data with only the selected sensors while dissipating 5.2 mW at a single 1.8 V supply. Both the sensor and the health monitoring band are implemented using P-FCB for enhanced wearability and for lower production cost. The sensor chip and the network controller chip occupy 4.8 mm2 and 15.0 mm2, respectively, including pads, in standard 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS technology.},

pages={1186-1197}, 
abstract={This work describes the architecture and circuit implementation of a high-data-rate, energy-efficient equalized transceiver for high-loss dispersive channels, such as RC-limited on-chip interconnects or silicon-carrier packaging modules. The charge-injection transmitter directly conducts pre-emphasis current from the supply into the channel, eliminating the power overhead of analog current subtraction in conventional transmit pre-emphasis, while significantly relaxing the driver coefficient accuracy requirements. The transmitter utilizes a power efficient non-linear driver by compensating non-linearity with pre-distorted equalization coefficients. A trans-impedance amplifier at the receiver achieves low static power consumption, large signal amplitude, and high bandwidth by mitigating limitations of purely-resistive termination. A test chip is fabricated in 90-nm bulk CMOS technology and tested over a 10-mm, 2- μm pitched on-chip differential wire. The transceiver consumes 0.37-0.63 pJ/b with 4-6 Gb/s/ch.},

abstract={This paper describes the design of a product-level low-power source-synchronous link receiver macro for data rates of 3.2-6.4 Gb/s. The receiver macro consists of 22 data channels plus one forwarded-clock channel, and supports both differential and ground termination. A pulsed CDR with programmable bandwidth is implemented to save power in the CDR. Time dithering is applied to the CDR to avoid notches in the jitter tolerance curve. The receiver clock path incorporates both a clean-up PLL and a polyphase filter for RX clock generation, from which one can be chosen to generate the receive clock. It is shown how jitter in a source-synchronous link is related to skew between clock and data, as well as cross-talk from the data to the clock wires. The jitter performance of the RX using either the polyphase filter or the PLL for clock generation is compared for different loop bandwidths. The RX core was implemented in a 65 nm Bulk CMOS technology. Total power consumption for the 22+1 lane RX PHY core running at 6.4 Gbps with the polyphase filter and in pulsed CDR mode is 635 mW or 4.5 mW/Gbps.},

The measured spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR) is approximately 45 dBc with a 4.2958 GHz Nyquist output, and 50 dBc with a 4.2 MHz output in the Nyquist band at the maximum clock frequency of 8.6 GHz. Under a 7.2 GHz clock input, the worst-case Nyquist band SFDR and narrow band SFDR are measured as 33 dBc and 42 dBc respectively.

This concept has been introduced to realize a low-voltage-operation SRAM with a small area penalty. The transistor threshold voltage (Vth) shift caused by hot carrier injection (HCI) is used for Vos trimming after chip fabrication. This scheme is observed to become more effective when repeated trimmings are applied. The SA with offset trimming circuit is implemented in 40-nm CMOS technology, and the reduction in the Vos by 76 mV is confirmed using the measurement and simulation results. This reduction corresponds to a 40% improvement in the read frequency and a 6× improvement in the failure rate at 0.6-V supply voltage.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated 2 RX × 1 TX dual-band direct-conversion mobile WiMAX transceiver in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The frequency division ratios of 4 for the low band (2.3-2.7 GHz) and 8/3 for the high band (3.3-3.8 GHz) are employed to provide high immunity to the VCO pulling and to cover the entire frequency range with a single VCO. A "distribute-then-fractional" frequency plan is proposed to provide the frequency division ratios without degrading the LO signal integrity in the LO distribution path. The proposed plan is achieved by an inductor-less LO distribution with a novel compact dual-mode fractional divider. A noise-shaping transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is also proposed to mitigate the flicker noise of scaled CMOS devices. The two receivers consume 214.1 mW and 247.7 mW in the low-band and the high-band operations, which are lower than the power consumption of the mobile WiMAX transceivers reported previously. In spite of the low power consumption, the receivers achieve the total noise figure of 3.8 dB and 4.5 dB in the low-band and the high-band operations by virtue of the proposed noise-shaping TIA.},

abstract={In many integrated class-D audio amplifiers large linear capacitors are used to create the triangular reference signals for generation of PWM signals. In this paper, an integrated class-D amplifier is presented that uses a control loop with area efficient nonlinear gate oxide capacitors. A model is used to show that the nonlinearity does not degrade the THD performance. To limit the maximum voltage on the gate oxide capacitor, a method was used to prevent voltage drift of the integrator output in case the amplifier is clipping. This method also improves the clipping recovery behavior. Measurements and simulations on two amplifiers with linear and nonlinear capacitors confirm that nonlinear capacitors do not introduce additional distortion. Measurements on the amplifier with and without the clipping recovery method confirm the improvement in clipping recovery.},

abstract={The opamp in the first integrator of a high resolution single-bit continuous-time modulator has stringent slew rate requirements, which increases power dissipation. We introduce the “assisted opamp” integrator, which is a way of achieving low distortion operation with low power consumption. We present circuit implementations of our technique for single-bit modulators using NRZ and switched-capacitor-resistor (SCR) feedback DACs. Audio modulators designed in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology are used as vehicles to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques. The modulator with an NRZ DAC achieves a dynamic range of 92.5 dB in a 24 kHz bandwidth and dissipates 110 μW from a 1.8 V supply. A second design, which employs an SCR-DAC, achieves a dynamic range of 91.5 dB and dissipates 122 μW. The figures of merit (FOM) of these modulators, 175.9 dB and 174.4 dB respectively, are comparable with those of state-of-the-art multibit designs.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45},

abstract={Multiview video coding (MVC) plays an important role in a 3-D video system. In addition, the resolution of HDTV is increasing to present more vivid perception for users. To realize real-time processing of dozens of TOPS, VLSI solution is necessary. However, ultra high computational complexity, a large amount of external memory bandwidth and on-chip SRAM size, and complex MVC prediction structures are three main design challenges of implementation of MVC hardware architecture. In this paper, an MVC single-chip encoder is proposed for H.264/AVC Multiview High Profile and High Profile for 3-D and quad full high definition (QFHD) TV applications, respectively. The 4096 × 2160 p multiview video encoder chip is implemented on a 11.46 mm2 die with 90 nm CMOS technology. An eight-stage macroblock pipelined architecture with proposed system scheduling and cache-based prediction core supports real-time processing from one-view 4096 × 2160 p to seven-view 720 p videos. The 212 Mpixels/s throughput is 3.4 to 7.7 times higher than previous work. The 407 Mpixels/W power efficiency is achieved, and 94% on-chip SRAM size and 79% external memory bandwidth are saved by the proposed techniques.},

title={Dynamic Quadrant Swapping Scheme Implemented in a Post Conversion Block for I, Q Mismatch Reduction in a DQPSK Receiver}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={2}, 
pages={322-337}, 
abstract={This paper presents a new dynamic quadrant swapping scheme that reduces crosstalk due to I/Q path mismatch for DQPSK receiver. The scheme reduces crosstalk by selectively transforming/swapping the I, Q components of the received symbols. The scheme's effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to the IF digitizer part of the receiver. In the IF digitizer the incoming IF (first IF) signal is mixed and then converted to two digital signals, the I and Q signals, both at a second IF. These digital signals are then fed into a post conversion block. In this block dynamic quadrant swapping is applied, which reduces the crosstalk. Using an IF digitizer that includes two separate mixers with two separate low pass sigma-delta modulators for I and Q paths, the scheme's effectiveness is tested. Both simulation results and measured results show a significant improvement in image rejection ratio and BER, when the scheme is applied. With a SNR of 10.8 dB, at a 160.16 MHz incoming IF, and with a data rate of 36 kbps, the scheme improves the measured BER from 4.2 Ã 10 to 1.4 Ã 10- 3. At a 10 MHz incoming IF, and with a data rate of 2 kbps, the scheme improves the measured image rejection ratio from 41 dB to 65 dB and the measured BER from 1.3 Ã 10-3 to 0.7 Ã 10-3. The post conversion block is layout in 0.09 Â¿m CMOS technology. It occupies an area of 0.00092 mm2, and is simpler than previous reported schemes. The IF digitizer is fabricated in 0.35 Â¿m CMOS technology.},

abstract={This paper describes both a near term and a long term optical interconnect solution, the first based on a packaging architecture and the second based on a monolithic photonic CMOS architecture. The packaging-based optical I/O architecture implemented with 90 nm CMOS transceiver circuits, 1 Ã 12 VCSEL/detector arrays and polymer waveguides achieves 10 Gb/s/channel at 11 pJ/b. A simple TX pre-emphasis technique enables a potential 18 Gb/s at 9.6 pJ/b link efficiency. Analysis predicts this architecture to reach less than 1 pJ/b at the 16 nm CMOS technology node. A photonic CMOS process enables higher bandwidth and lower energy-per-bit for chip-to-chip optical I/O through integration of electro-optical polymer based modulators, silicon nitride waveguides and polycrystalline germanium (Ge) detectors into a CMOS logic process. Experimental results for the photonic CMOS ring resonator modulators and Ge detectors demonstrate performance above 20 Gb/s and analysis predicts that photonic CMOS will eventually enable energy efficiency better than 0.3 pJ/b with 16 nm CMOS. Optical interconnect technologies such as these using multi-lane communication or wavelength division multiplexing have the potential to achieve TB/s interconnect and enable platforms suitable for the tera-scale computing era.},

abstract={Energy minimization is a critical goal in size-constrained wireless sensors. Sensing elements are traditionally power hungry and require special attention in low energy systems. In this work, we study ultra-low power image sensors. In particular, we explore the use of aggressive voltage scaling in CMOS image sensors for applications ranging from retinal prostheses to battlefield monitoring and surveillance. We begin with a discussion of the challenges faced by a traditional 3T active pixel sensor as the supply voltage scales to 0.5 V and below. We then discuss an image sensor with pulse-width modulation read-out that is optimized for 0.5 V operation. A 0.13 ¿¿m test-chip with a 128 ¿¿ 128 pixel array is shown to be functional with Vdd as low as 0.45 V with energy consumption of 140 nJ/frame at Vdd = 0.5 V (8.5 frames per second) and power consumption of only 700 nW at Vdd = 0.5 V (0.5 frames per second). A focus is also placed on quantifying the noise implications of low voltage operation on the test-chip, which has a measured signal-to-noise ratio of 23.4 dB in saturation at Vdd = 0.5 V.},

abstract={A field-programmable analog array (FPAA) with 32 computational analog blocks (CABs) and occupying 3 × 3 mm2 in 0.35-μm CMOS is presented. Each CAB has a wide variety of subcircuits ranging in granularity from multipliers and programmable offset wide-linear-range Gm blocks to nMOS and pMOS transistors. The programmable interconnects and circuit elements in the CAB are implemented using floating-gate (FG) transistors, the total number of which exceeds fifty thousand. Using FG devices eliminates the need for SRAM to store configuration bits since the switch stores its own configuration. This system exhibits significant performance enhancements over its predecessor in terms of achievable dynamic range (> 9 b of FG voltage) and speed (≈ 20 gates/s) of accurate FG current programming and isolation between ON and OFF switches. An improved routing fabric has been designed that includes nearest neighbor connections to minimize the penalty on bandwidth due to routing parasitic. A maximum bandwidth of 57 MHz through the switch matrix and around 5 MHz for a first-order low-pass filter is achievable on this chip, the limitation being a “program” mode switch that will be rectified in the next chip. Programming performance improved drastically by implementing the entire algorithm on-chip with an SPI digital interface. Measured results of the individual subcircuits and two system examples including an AM receiver and a speech processor are presented.},

abstract={In this paper, a linearity improvement technique is proposed for a low-distortion Gm-C bandpass filter operating in high IF ranges. The proposed transconductor eliminates Gm" value at the output by superposing the opposite non-linear behaviors of two differential structures in parallel. For the bandpass filter, instead of conventional biquad structure, a resonant-coupling structure is adopted for a flat frequency response which is insensitive to process and temperature variations. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process, the implemented 80 MHz bandpass filter shows a flat bandpass characteristic with 0.1 dB ripple, third-order harmonic rejection of 27 dB, IIP3 of -2 dBm, and NF of 21.5 dB, while consuming 11 mA from 1.2-V supply. The filter occupies the chip size of 0.5 × 0.5 mm2.},

abstract={This paper presents a precision 18-bit 12.5 MS/s ADC that was designed primarily for digital X-ray imaging systems. This ADC was intended to have a faster output data rate than the precision successive approximation ADCs normally chosen for these systems but with similar DC accuracy and dynamic range. The chosen architecture consists of a pipeline of two multi-bit successive approximation converters. The first successive approximation ADC generates an initial coarse conversion result. The DACs within this converter are then used to generate a residue which is amplified by a residue amplifier before being converted by a second successive approximation ADC. Four comparators within each ADC allow 2 bits to be determined each bit trial. Capacitor mismatch errors are digitally corrected with error coefficients stored in non-volatile memory. Dither is used to reduce the effect of errors in the flash ADC within the second ADC. The ADC was implemented on 0.25 m CMOS process with PIP capacitors and achieves a SNR of 93 dB with a 50 kHz input tone. INL and DNL are within LSB and LSB respectively. Power consumption is 105 mW, excluding LVDS interface power.},

abstract={This paper presents a delta-sigma pulse-width digitizer (ΔΣ-PWD) architecture designed for a super-regenerative receiver (SR-RX) operated at the 400-MHz Medical Implantable Communications Service (MICS) band. The ΔΣ-PWD employs the operation principle of a ΔΣ modulator to convert the pulse-width (PW) value into digital domain and achieve fine resolution, which allows the SR-RX to support the 2-ASK/4-ASK modulations. It can be considered as the PW domain counterpart of a conventional ΔΣ modulator. The proposed architecture is capable of suppressing the PW quantization error over the direct-sampling-type PW detector by 23 dB. A linear model for the ΔΣ-PWD is devised in this paper for system analysis and design optimization. Fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the whole receiver draws 700 μA from a 1.3-V supply, while the ΔΣ-PWD consumes only 100 μA. When operated on the 4-ASK modulation signal with 312-kbps data rate, the receiver achieves an energy efficiency of 2.9 nj/bit and -76-dBm sensitivity.},

abstract={This paper presents a class G amplifier based on a low distortion switching principle technique called switching currents injection. The switching circuit enables a very smooth handover between the voltage supply rails obtaining both high efficiency and low distortion. An approach for the evaluation of the switching distortion in a class G amplifier (and the ability of the loop to reject it) is proposed and the results obtained are used to optimize the overall distortion after compression by the feedback loop. The integrated 65 nm CMOS class G headphone driver based on the above concept operates from ±1.4 V and ±0.35 V supplies. At low power level it uses almost exclusively the low voltage supply reducing the dissipation to 1.63 mW @ Pout = 0.5 mW into 32 Ω. At higher power level, where both supplies are used, the smooth transition between the rails allows a THD + N better than -80 dB for Pout ≤ 16 mW into 32 Ω. The SNR is 101 dB, quiescent power is 0.41 m W and active die area is 0.14 mm2.},

pages={1080-1087}, 
abstract={This paper describes a new capacitive-sensing circuit technique that improves the quality of images captured with capacitive fingerprint sensor LSIs. The quality of the captured image depends on the surface condition of the finger. When the finger is dry, the electrical resistance of the finger surface is high. The finger surface resistance induces a voltage drop in the electrical potential of the finger surface (which should be grounded), which leads to poor image quality. To capture clear images even when the finger is dry, the circuit technique improves the image quality using the series resistance caused at the finger surface. The potential of the finger surface is controlled by an enhancement plate and a voltage control circuit. A test chip implementing this technique was fabricated on a 0.5 ¿¿m CMOS process and a sensor process. The chip captures a clear fingerprint image of a dry finger, confirming the effectiveness of the circuit technique for capturing clear fingerprint images independent of the finger surface condition with the capacitive fingerprint sensor LSIs.},

pages={741-750}, 
abstract={This paper presents a low power boost converter for thermoelectric energy harvesting that demonstrates an efficiency that is 15% higher than the state-of-the-art for voltage conversion ratios above 20. This is achieved by utilizing a technique allowing synchronous rectification in the discontinuous conduction mode. A low-power method for input voltage monitoring is presented.

abstract={An all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with all components working with time interval or period signals is demonstrated. The ADPLL consists mainly of a free-running ring oscillator (FRO), a time to digital converter (TDC), a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), a digital divider and a digital loop filter. In the proposed architecture, the TDC and DCO have an equal time resolution from the common FRO. The digital divider keeps the loop gain constant when the frequency multiplication factor changes. As a result, the ADPLL is inherently stable regardless of the variations of the process, supply voltage and temperature (PVT). The ADPLL is fabricated in 0.13 ??m CMOS process. Measurement results show that it works well over wide operation conditions, with the input frequencies ranging from 37.5 KHz to 25 MHz, frequency multiplication factors from 10 to 255, output frequencies from 10 MHz to 500 MHz, and supply voltages from 0.6 V to 1.6 V.},

abstract={Direct delta-sigma receiver architecture is introduced for wireless communication systems, such as LTE or WiMax. Architecture is based on direct downconversion, delta-sigma feedback that is up-converted to RF, and N-path filtering technique. Hence, the core receiver functions including channel selection filtering are embedded to a RF ADC with excellent linearity performance. This is achieved by transforming narrow-band filtering partially to RF injecting feedback into the input of the second amplifier stage, hence relieving requirements of the most critical subsequent stages. A 900-MHz direct delta-sigma receiver prototype occupies an active area of 1.2 mm2 in 65-nm CMOS. The receiver for low-band cellular operations achieves NF of 2.3 and 6.2 dB in conventional and delta-sigma modes, respectively, and out-of-band IIP3 up to +4 dBm when the delta-sigma loop is active.

abstract={Two continuous-time input pipeline ADC architectures are introduced. The continuous-time input approach overcomes many of the challenges associated with a pure switched-capacitor architecture. The resistive input load of the two new architectures provides a benign interface to external drive circuitry. The switched-capacitor sampling function is moved to the second stage input which greatly eases the sampling distortion requirements and obviates the need for an explicit front-end sample-and-hold function. The second ADC presented additionally provides inherent anti-alias filtering, allowing the possibility of eliminating costly anti-alias filters. This second architecture also eases the jitter requirements of the ADC clock when compared to switched capacitor pipeline ADCs. Measured results obtained from two proof of concept test chips fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.},

title={Exploring Asynchronous Design Techniques for Process-Tolerant and Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Operation}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={2}, 
pages={401-410}, 
abstract={Supply voltage scaling is one of the easiest ways to reduce energy dissipation. Therefore, researchers have considered subthreshold logic as a promising option to achieve ultra low energy dissipation. However, circuit propagation delay is extremely sensitive to PVT variations under subthreshold operation. Hence, large delay margin is required for successful operation of conventional synchronous designs. Since leakage energy contributes to a substantial portion of total energy dissipation in subthreshold operation, the leakage energy dissipated for the required delay margin degrades energy efficiency significantly. In addition, even small intra-die variations result in large clock skew and hence, it is difficult to efficiently handle timing issues such as the setup and the hold time violations. In this work, we explore asynchronous design approach to address these challenges in subthreshold operation. We employ critical-path replica to generate completion signals of combinational logic blocks and use classical four-phase handshaking for communication between pipeline flip-flops. Since the proposed design approach uses only local clock buffers, it is easier to handle timing problems compared to synchronous designs. We compared iso-yield minimum energy dissipation of two design approaches (synchronous and asynchronous) in an inverter chain. Despite leakage overhead due to pad delay of critical-path delay line and ?return-to-zero? time of four-phase handshaking, the proposed asynchronous design shows 71% energy savings compared to its synchronous counterpart. To demonstrate subthreshold operation of the proposed design approach, we fabricated an 8-tap FIR filter in 90 nm CMOS. Measured oscilloscope plots of handshaking and output bus signals show that the design operates successfully below 300 mV. We also measured energy consumption of the FIR filter from 19 test chips-the average was 4.64 pJ and the standard deviation was 0.3526 pJ.},

abstract={This paper describes a 16-bit 250 MS/s ADC fabricated on a 0.18 BiCMOS process. The ADC has an integrated input buffer with a new linearization technique that improves its distortion by 5-10 dB and lowers its power consumption by 70% relative to the state of the art. It demonstrates a new background calibration technique to correct the residue amplifier (RA) gain errors and lower its power consumption. This summing node sampling (SNS) calibration technique is based on sampling the summing-node voltage of the residue amplifier and using it with the corresponding residue to estimate the amplifier open loop gain. The ADC achieves an SNDR of 76.5 dB and consumes 850 mW from a 1.8 V supply, while the input buffer consumes 150 mW from a 3 V supply. Up to 125 MS/s, the SFDR is greater than 100 dB for input frequencies up to 100 MHz and 90 dB up to 300 MHz input frequency.

The oscillation frequency is several GHz and can be tuned by both a DC bias current and an external DC magnetic field. High compactness, high tunability and full compatibility with standard CMOS process make this spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) a promising candidate for future RF transceivers. The main issues to be addressed are spectral purity and output power. First measurements on a hybrid built connecting the STNO to a dedicated wideband amplifier show that today's performance in terms of power is close to but not yet compatible with telecommunication standard requirements. Using time domain analysis we show that frequency fluctuations are an issue for spectral purity. Frequency synthesis concepts based on STNOs are also discussed.},

The active silicon area is compressed by 64% relative to the C4 bumps using on-chip transmission line routing. A dense, top-side package connector and bridge enable both high off-chip interconnect density and low overall power by reducing equalization and deskew requirements. The interface also demonstrates fast power management for the I/O circuits. The receiver power can be reduced by 93% during standby and an integrated wake-up timer indicates that all lanes return reliably to active mode in <;5 ns.

abstract={The use of multiple power supplies with different output voltages has a great advantage in that it makes it possible to realize high performance ULSIs with low power dissipation. This paper presents a high-speed low-power SRAM that employs three power supplies (1, 2, and 3.3 V). A 1-V power supply is mainly used in the SRAM core to save standby and/or active power, while a 2-V supply is used in critical components to realize high performance. The voltage applicable to each MOSFET is up to 2.2 V because of the use of a 5-nm ultrathin gate oxide, and so the 3.3-V power supply is used only for LV-TTL level I/O buffers. Secure write operation for 1-V six-transistor memory cells is guaranteed by using a new switched powerline impedance scheme. To reduce dynamic write power dissipation, a segmented bitline scheme is adopted and long global bitlines are assigned to the 4th (topmost) metal layer. The data stored in memory cells are read out via virtual-GND lines by sensing the change in current volume. The practical use of parasitic bipolar action in SOI MOSFETs is being actively considered as a way of obtaining a large read current from memory cells. In addition, a 1-V double-rail bidirectional intradatabus is developed for transferring multibit high-speed data between the SRAM core and I/O buffers. A 32K-word × 9-bit SRAM chip, fabricated with the 0.2-μm-gate CMOS/SIMOX process, has achieved a 7.5-ns address access time for 65-pF external loads. The power dissipation during standby is less than 0.3 mW and the values for 100-MHz operation are 5.8 mW (write) and 11.0 mW (read), excluding that of the 3.3-V I/O buffers.},

abstract={Due to global and local process variations, on-chip SRAM suffers failures at a low supply voltage (VDD). This study proposes a differential data-aware power-supplied D2 AP 8T SRAM cell to address the stability and trade-off-issues between write and half-select accesses that still remain in the conventional 8T and 6T cells. Powered by its bitline pair, the proposed 8T cell applies differential data-aware-supplied voltages to its cross-coupled inverters to increase both stability margins for write and half-select accesses. A boosted bitline scheme also improves the read cell current.

abstract={This paper presents a low-power SoC that performs EEG acquisition and feature extraction required for continuous detection of seizure onset in epilepsy patients. The SoC corresponds to one EEG channel, and, depending on the patient, up to 18 channels may be worn to detect seizures as part of a chronic treatment system. The SoC integrates an instrumentation amplifier, ADC, and digital processor that streams features-vectors to a central device where seizure detection is performed via a machine-learning classifier. The instrumentation-amplifier uses chopper-stabilization in a topology that achieves high input-impedance and rejects large electrode-offsets while operating at 1 V; the ADC employs power-gating for low energy-per-conversion while using static-biasing for comparator precision; the EEG feature extraction processor employs low-power hardware whose parameters are determined through validation via patient data. The integration of sensing and local processing lowers system power by 14¿¿ by reducing the rate of wireless EEG data transmission. Feature vectors are derived at a rate of 0.5 Hz, and the complete one-channel SoC operates from a 1 V supply, consuming 9 ¿¿ J per feature vector.},

abstract={Implementing efficient and cost-effective power regulation schemes for battery-powered mixed-signal SoCs is a key focus in integrated circuit design. This paper presents a fully-integrated switched-capacitor DC-DC converter in 45 nm digital CMOS technology. The proposed implementation uses digital capacitance modulation instead of traditional PFM and PWM control methods to maintain regulation against load current changes. This technique preserves constant frequency switching while also scaling switching and bottom-plate losses with changes in load current. Therefore, high efficiency can be achieved across different load current levels while maintaining a predictable switching noise behavior. The converter occupies only 0.16 mm2, and operates from 1.8 V input. It delivers a programmable sub-1 V power supply with efficiency as high as 69% and load current between 100 μA and 8 mA. Measurement results confirm the theoretical basis of the proposed design.},

The circuit also exhibits 10-dBm saturated output power and ~ 22% maximum PAE. By realigning the highest output power level to the 10-dBm saturated output power, the efficiency can be improved. For a random data pattern, this PA should achieve ~ 2X higher efficiency than Class A PAs. The circuit supports seven amplitude levels for 400 Megabits per second (Mbps) data transmission.

Self contained clocking with metal-finger flying capacitors enable embedding voltage boost functionality in close proximity to digital logic for supplying low current Vmin requirement of state elements in logic blocks. Multi-phase operation with phase separation of the order of buffer delays avoids the need for a large storage reservoir capacitor. Special configuration of the pump stages to work in parallel enables a fast (5 ns) output transition from disable to enable state.

abstract={This paper describes a three-dimensional (3-D) system integration of a full-fledged processor chip and two memory chips using inductive coupling. To attain a 3-D communication link with a smaller area and lower power-consumption, shortening the link distance and preventing signal degradation due to unused inductors are important challenges. Therefore, we developed a new 3D-integrated wire-penetrated multi-layer structure for a shorter link distance and an open-skipped-inductor scheme for suppressing signal degradation. In addition, to avoid undefined-value propagation in stacking multi-memories using an inductive-coupling link, we proposed a memory-access-control scheme with a pinpoint-data-capture scheme. We demonstrate that three fabricated chips can be successfully AC-coupled using inductive coupling. The power and area efficiency of the link are 1 pj/b and 0.15 mm2 /Gbps, respectively, which are the same as those of two-chip integration.},

abstract={This paper presents a sixth-order bandpass ΣΔ modulator with 10 MHz bandwidth and 200 MHz center frequency suitable for high-IF applications. The fs/4 modulator employs an 800 MHz clock frequency and uses an active RC loop filter implemented with three-stage linearized operational amplifiers achieving more than 50 dB gain at 200 MHz. Furthermore, a calibration technique is proposed to compensate for process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, which involves measurement and optimization of the noise transfer function by injecting two auxiliary tones at the quantizer input. The modulator achieves 68.4 dB peak SNDR measured in 10 MHz bandwidth and IM3 of -73.5 dB at -2 dBr input signal. Fabricated in a vanilla 0.18 μm CMOS technology, the modulator consumes 160 mW (static + dynamic power) and occupies an active silicon area of 2.5 mm2.},

abstract={Many technological bottlenecks prevent from realizing a software radio (SR) mobile terminal. The old way of building radio architectures is now over because a single handled terminal has to address various communication standards. This paper exposes a SR receiver: a sampled analog signal processor (SASP) is designed to perform downconversion and channel presorting. The idea is to process analog voltage samples in order to recover in baseband any RF signal emitted from 0 to 5 GHz. An analog fast Fourier transform achieves both frequency shifting and filtering. An experimental demonstrator of the SASP using 65 nm CMOS technology from STMicroelectronics is here presented and measured. It validates the concept of a new SR receiver with the design of a demonstrator which runs at 1.2 GHz consuming 389 mW.},

pages={1436-1445}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a local feedback, named Auto Correction Feedback (ACFB), for a chopper amplifier to suppress its offset related ripple. It nulls out the amplifier's initial offset in DC domain which would otherwise become modulated ripple at the chopper amplifier's output, instead of filtering the ripple with a post filter. The proposed ACFB has been implemented as a stand alone chopper operational amplifier fabricated in 0.64 mm2 die area with a 0.35 μm standard CMOS process. It achieves 10 μV maximum input offset voltage and 95 nV/rt(Hz) input voltage noise spectrum density flat down to 0.1 Hz, with a 1.8-5.5 V supply voltage range and 13 μA supply current dissipation. When configured in unity-gain, the typical magnitude of the input referred ripple at the chopping frequency is 9.4 μVrms, as a result of 45 dB ripple attenuation obtained by the ACFB. The analysis, the simulation, and the measurement prove there is no noise penalty due to the addition of ACFB.},

abstract={A phased-array transmitter (TX) for multi-Gb/s non-line-of-sight links in the four frequency channels of the IEEE 802.15.3c standard (58.32 to 64.8 GHz) is fully integrated in a 0.12-μm SiGe BiCMOS process. It consists of an up-conversion core followed by a 1:16 power distribution tree, 16 phase-shifting front-ends, and a digital control unit. The TX core is a two-step sliding-IF up-conversion chain with frequency synthesizer that features 40 dB of gain programmability, I/Q balance and LO leakage correction, and a modulator for 802.15.3c common-mode signaling. The tradeoffs involved in the implementation of a 1:16 power distribution network are analyzed and a hybrid passive/active distribution tree architecture is introduced. Each of the 16 front-ends consists of a balanced passive phase shifter and a variable-gain, 3-stage PA that features oP1dB programmability through the bias control of the its final stage. All of the chip features are digitally controllable and individual memory arrays are integrated at each front-end to enable fast beam steering through a high-speed parallel interface. The IC occupies 44 mm and is fully characterized on wafer. The TX delivers 9 to 13.5 dBm oPidB per element at 60.48 GHz with a total power consumption of 3.8 to 6.2 W. Each element attains a phase-shift range >360° with an amplitude variation <;±1 dB across phase settings and adjacent elements.

It relies on the combination of fractional division and frequency interpolation for coarse and fine tuning respectively. By proper calibration and application of temperature dependent corrections, any frequency below that of the uncompensated resonator can be generated yielding programmability, resonator fabrication tolerances and temperature drift compensation without requiring a PLL. To minimize the IC area, a dual oscillator temperature measurement concept based on a ring oscillator/resistor thermal sensor was implemented yielding a resolution of 0.04°C.

abstract={For passive mm-wave imaging applications, broadband mm-wave receivers functioning within atmospheric windows are highly desired. Within this paper, a heterodyne receiver chipset utilizing the 140 GHz atmospheric window is presented. The heterodyne chipset is based on two different millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuits (MIMICs). One is the receiver MIMIC including a low-noise amplifier, a down-conversion mixer, a frequency multiplier and a local oscillator buffer amplifier together with a local oscillator distribution network. The other is a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) working in the 35 GHz frequency range to generate the local oscillator signal for the receiver (down-converter) chip. The process technology chosen to realize the chipset is a 100 nm gatelength metamorphic InAlAs/InGaAs high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology on 50 μm thick and 4 inch diameter GaAs substrates. The chips are utilizing a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) technology. For an operation frequency band from 120 to 145 GHz, the receiver demonstrates a flat conversion gain between -1 and +2 dB with a power consumption of 120 mW. The VCO is tuneable from 31 to 37 GHz with associated output power levels from -2 to +1 dBm. Detailed descriptions of the individual building blocks are given and measured results are presented for the building blocks as well as for the receiver.},

abstract={An ultrawideband transceiver employing chirp pulse modulation is proposed for LDR communication. In contrast to the Gaussian pulse, a transmitted pulse modulated with different chirps can maximize the transmitted energy under low supply voltage and is thus amenable to the voltage scalability of the advanced CMOS technologies. The binary data is encoded with different chirp frequencies and two identical pulses are sent per data bit to enable non-coherent demodulation which simplifies the receiver architecture. A demodulation calibration loop is also incorporated to optimize the SIR performance. In-band/out-of-band SIR as low as -21dB/-59 dB can be tolerated in order to achieve BER better than 10-3. Implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS, the transceiver can sustain data rates up to 20 Mbps, and achieve energy efficiency of 0.77 nJ/bit for transmitting and 2.7 nJ/bit for receiving under 1.8 V supply.},

abstract={This paper provides a soft Bose-Chaudhuri-Hochquenghem (BCH) decoder chip with soft information from the LDPC decoder for the DVB-S2 system. In contrast with the hard BCH decoder, the proposed soft BCH decoder that deals with least reliable bits can provide much lower complexity with similar error-correcting performance. Moreover, the error locator evaluator is proposed to evaluate error locations without the Chien search for higher throughput, and the Björck-Pereyra error magnitude solver (BP-EMS) is presented to improve decoding efficiency and hardware complexity. The chip measurement results reveal that our proposed soft (32400, 32208) BCH decoder for DVB-S2 system can achieve 314.5 Mb/s with a gate-count of 26.9 K in standard 90 nm 1P9M CMOS technology.

abstract={On-chip frequency generators for high frequency applications suffer from degradation of key passive components, variable capacitors in particular. In this framework, frequency multipliers can play a key role, allowing the design of voltage-controlled oscillators running at a frequency lower than required with advantage in terms of signal spectral purity and frequency tuning range. In this paper we present two injection locked frequency doublers for Ku-band and F-band applications respectively. Despite differences in implementation details, the same topology where a push-push pair injects a double frequency tone locking an autonomous differential oscillator is adopted. The circuits require limited input signal swing and provide a differential output over a broad frequency range. Dissipating 5.2 mW, the Ku-band multiplier, realized in a 0.13 μm CMOS node, displays an operation bandwidth from 11 GHz to 15 GHz with a peak voltage swing on each output of 470 mV. The F-band multiplier, realized in 65 nm CMOS technology, displays an operation bandwidth from 106 GHz to 128 GHz with a peak voltage swing on each output of 330 mV and a power dissipation of 6 mW. A prototype including the multiplier, driven by a half-frequency standard LC-tank VCO, demonstrates an outstanding 13.1% tuning range around 115 GHz.},

title={Spur Reduction Techniques for Phase-Locked Loops Exploiting A Sub-Sampling Phase Detector}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={9}, 
pages={1809-1821}, 
abstract={This paper presents phase-locked loop (PLL) reference-spur reduction design techniques exploiting a sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD) (which is also referred to as a sampling phase detector). The VCO is sampled by the reference clock without using a frequency divider and an amplitude controlled charge pump is used which is inherently insensitive to mismatch. The main remaining source of the VCO reference spur is the periodic disturbance of the VCO by the sampling at the reference frequency. The underlying VCO sampling spur mechanisms are analyzed and their effect is minimized by using dummy samplers and isolation buffers. A duty-cycle-controlled reference buffer and delay-locked loop (DLL) tuning are proposed to further reduce the worst case spur level. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spur reduction techniques, a 2.21 GHz PLL is designed and fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. While using a high loop-bandwidth-to-reference-frequency ratio of 1/20, the reference spur measured from 20 chips is <; -80 dBc. The PLL consumes 3.8 mW while the in-band phase noise is -121 dBc/Hz at 200 kHz and the output jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 100 MHz is 0.3psrms.},

abstract={In this paper, dynamic Vpass ISPP schemes and optimizing Vth of erase memory cells are presented for achieving high program inhibition with lower program disturbance in sub-40 nm MLC NAND flash and beyond. Simple two-step dynamic Vpass control technique is used and over 40% program failure reduction after 30 k P/E cycling is achieved in the proposed scheme, compared to conventional method. A major pattern dependency of program disturbance in MLC NAND flash is also described in this paper. In order to achieve high immunity for the data pattern dependency in program disturbance, optimizing erase Vth and its distribution using ISPP-after-erase with a precise negative Vth sensing scheme are proposed. The proposed schemes are demonstrated using 42 nm MLC NAND flash test chip and about 2 times better Vpass window margin is obtained compared to conventional scheme.},

pages={652-667}, 
abstract={In this paper, a heterogeneous 3D-media processor is presented, which supports all 3-D display applications by combining a 3-D display IP with a 3-D graphics IP and a stereo video decoder. For mobile environments, adaptive power management scheme is proposed, which saves power consumption up to 186 mW by turning off idle functional blocks based on a target application, a target performance, and the run-time ratio between different IPs. As a result, the minimum power consumption of the processor is only 15 mW, while the overall power consumption is 201 mW. As well as the reduction of power consumption, this work shows impressive performance improvement. The proposed fast modulo operators and adopted division-free algorithm reduces the critical latencies of 3-D display image processing. The proposed fast datapath with parallel architecture increase synthesis rate up to 116 fps which is 17 times faster than a previous work. In addition, reordered operation sequence fixes memory bandwidth regardless of the number of images to be produced. In the 3-D graphics IP and the decoding IP, redundant datapath are merged using an IEEE 754 compliant floating-point vector unit to save both chip area and power consumption, which even reduces the critical latency by 30%.},

abstract={This paper presents a 4.3 GB/s mobile memory interface that utilizes low power states with rapid transition times to support power efficient signaling over a wide range of effective bandwidths. The fastest power state transition is implemented by a global synchronous clock pause that gates dynamic power consumption without any loss of system state. Extensive use of CMOS circuit topologies, with low static power consumption, provides maximum power savings when the clocks are paused. The memory controller forwards a half bit-rate clock to the memory for synchronous communication, which is similarly paused in the low power state. Thus, dynamic interface power on the memory itself naturally responds to the clock pausing, without any explicit communication from the controller or special low-power state on the memory. Low-swing differential signaling based on a push-pull voltage mode driver results in good signal integrity and power efficiency at peak activity. Test-chips fabricated in a 40 nm low-power CMOS technology achieve 3.3 mW/Gb/s power efficiency at 4.3 GB/s data bandwidth, and support better than 5 mW/Gb/s operation over a range from 0.03 to 4.3 GB/s.},

title={Far-Field On-Chip Antennas Monolithically Integrated in a Wireless-Powered 5.8-GHz Downlink/UWB Uplink RFID Tag in 0.18-$mu{hbox {m}}$ Standard CMOS},

abstract={This paper discusses two antennas monolithically integrated on-chip to be used respectively for wireless powering and UWB transmission of a tag designed and fabricated in 0.18-μm CMOS technology. A multiturn loop-dipole structure with inductive and resistive stubs is chosen for both antennas. Using these on-chip antennas, the chip employs asymmetric communication links: at downlink, the tag captures the required supply wirelessly from the received RF signal transmitted by a reader and, for the uplink, ultra-wideband impulse-radio (UWB-IR), in the 3.1-10.6-GHz band, is employed instead of backscattering to achieve extremely low power and a high data rate up to 1 Mb/s. At downlink with the on-chip power-scavenging antenna and power-management unit circuitry properly designed, 7.5-cm powering distance has been achieved, which is a huge improvement in terms of operation distance compared with other reported tags with on-chip antenna. Also, 7-cm operating distance is achieved with the implemented on-chip UWB antenna. The tag can be powered up at all the three ISM bands of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz, with off-chip antennas, and 5.8 GHz with the integrated on-chip antenna. The tag receives its clock and the commands wirelessly through the modulated RF powering-up signal. Measurement results show that the tag can operate up to 1 Mb/s data rate with a minimum input power of -19.41 dBm at 915-MHz band, corresponding to 15.7 m of operation range with an off-chip 0-dB gain antenna. This is a great improvement compared with conventional passive RFIDs in term of data rate and operation distance. The power consumption of the chip is measured to be just 16.6 μW at the clock frequency of 10 MHz at 1.2-V supply. In addition, in this paper, for the first time, the radiation pattern of an on-chip antenna at such a frequency is measured. The measurement shows that the antenna has an almost omnidirectional radiation pattern so that the chip's performance- is less direction-dependent.},

abstract={A digital PLL (DPLL) with a time-to-digital converter (TDC) embedded within a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) has been implemented in 65 nm CMOS occupying an active area of 0.027 mm . The quantization step of the TDC naturally tracks the DCO period over corners, and therefore requires no calibration. By utilizing an interpolation flip flop, the timing resolution provided by DCO is further enhanced. The DPLL achieves fractional-N operation without a multi-modulus feedback divider, thereby avoiding its complexity and quantization noise. To improve the TDC linearity, a mismatch filtering technique that incorporates cross-coupled resistor network is proposed to achieve a DNL less than 0.04 LSB of the TDC quantization level. The prototype consumes 3.2 mW with an operation frequency ranging from 600 to 800 MHz. The measured DPLL output phase noise at 800 MHz frequency (after a divide-by-two) achieves and dBc/Hz at 1 kHz and 1 MHz offset, respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, a 4-GHz, four-channel, analog-beamforming direct-conversion down-converter in 90-nm CMOS is presented. Down-converting vector modulators (VMs) in each channel multiply the inputs with complex beamforming weights before summation between the different channels. The VMs are based on a phase-oversampling technique that allows the synthesis of inherently linear, high-resolution complex gains without complex variable gain amplifiers. A bank of simple passive mixers driven by a multiphase local oscillator (LO) in each VM performs accurate phase shifting with minimal signal distortion, and a pair of transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) combines the mixer outputs to perform beamforming weighting and combining. Each individual channel achieves 360° phase shift and gain-setting programmability with 8-bit digital control, a complex gain constellation with a mean error-vector magnitude (EVM) of <;2%, and a measured phase error of <; 5.5° at a back-off of 4 dB from the maximum gain setting.

abstract={Embedded NAND-type read-only-memory (NAND-ROM) provides large-capacity, high-reliability, on-chip non-volatile storage. However, NAND-ROM suffers from code-dependent read noises and cannot survive at low supply voltages (VDDs). These code-dependent read noises are primarily due to the charge-sharing effect, bitline leakage current, and crosstalk between bitlines, which become worse at lower VDD. This study proposes a dynamic split source-line (DSSL) scheme for NAND-ROM. The proposed scheme overcomes code-dependent read noises while improving the read access time and suppressing the active-mode gate leakage current, with only a 1% area penalty in the cell array. Experiments on a fabricated 256 Kb macro using a 90 nm industrial logic process demonstrate that the proposed DSSL scheme achieves 100% code-pattern coverage under a small sensing margin. Additionally, the DSSL NAND-ROM works with a wide range of supply voltages (1-0.31 V) with a 38%, 45.8%, and 37% improvement in speed, power, and standby current, respectively, at VDD = 1 V.},

abstract={We present a design technique for (near) subthreshold operation that achieves ultra low energy dissipation at throughputs of up to 100 MB/s suitable for digital consumer electronic applications. Our approach employs i) architecture-level parallelism to compensate throughput degradation, ii) a configurable V T balancer to mitigate the V T mismatch of nMOS and pMOS transistors operating in sub/near threshold, and iii) a fingered-structured parallel transistor that exploits V T mismatch to improve current drivability. Additionally, we describe the selection procedure of the standard cells and how they were modified for higher reliability in the subthreshold regime. All these concepts are demonstrated using SubJPEG, a 1.4 Ã1.4 mm2 65 nm CMOS standard-V T multi-standard JPEG co-processor. Measurement results of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and quantization processing engines, operating in the subthreshold regime, show an energy dissipation of only 0.75 pJ per cycle with a supply voltage of 0.4 V at 2.5 MHz. This leads to 8.3Ã energy reduction when compared to using a 1.2 V nominal supply. In the near-threshold regime the energy dissipation is 1.0 pJ per cycle with a 0.45 V supply voltage at 4.5 MHz. The system throughput can meet 15 fps 640 Ã 480 pixel VGA standard. Our methodology is largely applicable to designing other sound/graphic and streaming processors.},

abstract={Monolithic PWM voltage-mode buck converters with a novel Pseudo-Type III (PT3) compensation are presented. The proposed compensation maintains the fast load transient response of the conventional Type III compensator; while the Type III compensator response is synthesized by adding a high-gain low-frequency path (via error amplifier) with a moderate-gain high-frequency path (via bandpass filter) at the inputs of PWM comparator. As such, smaller passive components and low-power active circuits can be used to generate two zeros required in a Type III compensator. Constant Gm/C biasing technique can also be adopted by PT3 to reduce the process variation of passive components, which is not possible in a conventional Type III design. Two prototype chips are fabricated in a 0.35-μm CMOS process with constant Gm/C biasing technique being applied to one of the designs. Measurement result shows that converter output is settled within 7 μs for a load current step of 500 mA. Peak efficiency of 97% is obtained at 360 mW output power, and high efficiency of 86% is measured for output power as low as 60 mW. The area and power consumption of proposed compensator is reduced by > 75 % in both designs, compared to an equivalent conventional Type III compensator.},

abstract={This paper proposes a low-power SRAM using bit-line charge-recycling for read and write operations. The charge-recycling SRAM (CR-SRAM) reduces the read and write powers by recycling the charge in bit lines. When N bit lines recycle their charges, the swing voltage and power of bit lines are reduced to 1/N and 1/N2, respectively. The CR-SRAM utilizes hierarchical bit-line architecture to perform the charge-recycling without static noise margin degradation in memory cells. In the simulation, the CR-SRAM saves 17% read power and 84% write power compared with the conventional SRAM. A CR-SRAM chip with 4 K × 8 bits is implemented in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. It consumes 0.128-mW read power and 0.135-mW write power at fCLK = 100 MHz and VDD = 1.2 V.},

abstract={A 10 GHz all digital frequency synthesizer (ADPLL) with dynamic digital loop filter is presented. Governed by a proposed locking process monitor (LPM), the digital loop filter is automatically reconfigured during the frequency acquisition and phase tracking process. The loop bandwidth is also self-adjusted during the locking process so as to achieve fast lock and low noise simultaneously. A skew-compensated phase accumulator is proposed for high speed operation, which preserves the advantages of low power dissipation while eliminating the accumulated timing skew issue. With less than 7 Â¿s locking time, the measured rms jitter from a 9.92 GHz carrier is about 0.9 ps. The ADPLL core consumes 7.1 mW from a 1 V supply, and the digital I/O cells drains 2.7 mW from a 3.3 V supply for chip measurement.

pages={1198-1208}, 
abstract={This paper shows that multirate processing in a cascaded discrete-time ΔΣ modulator allows to reduce the power consumption by up to 35%. Multirate processing is possible in a discrete-time ΔΣ modulator by its adaptibility with the sampling frequency. The power reduction can be achieved by relaxing the sampling speed of the first stage and increasing it appropriately in the second stage. Furthermore, a cascaded ΔΣ modulator enables the power efficient implementation of multiple communication standards.@The advantages of multirate cascaded ΔΣ modulators are demonstrated by comparing the performance of single-rate and multirate implementations using behavioral-level and circuit-level simulations. This analysis has been further validated with the design of a multirate cascaded triple-mode discrete-time ΔΣ modulator. A 2-1 multirate low-pass cascade, with a sampling frequency of 80 MHz in the first stage and 320 MHz in the second stage, meets the requirements for UMTS. The first stage alone is suitable for digitizing Bluetooth and GSM with a sampling frequency of 90 and 50 MHz respectively. This multimode ΔΣ modulator is implemented in a 1.2 V 90 nm CMOS technology with a core area of 0.076 mm2. Measurement results show a dynamic range of 66/77/85 dB for UMTS/ Bluetooth/GSM with a power consumption of 6.8/3.7/3.4 mW. This results in an energy per conversion step of 1.2/0.74/2.86 pJ.},

pages={422-432}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a turbo decoder that utilizes multiple soft-in/soft-out (SISO) decoders to decode one codeword. In addition, each SISO decoder is modified to allow simultaneous execution over multiple successive trellis stages. The design issues related to the architecture with parallel high-radix SISO decoders are discussed. First, a contention-free interleaver for the hybrid parallelism is presented to overcome the complicated collision problem as well as reduce interconnection network complexity. Second, two techniques for the high-speed add-compare-select (ACS) circuits are given to lessen area overhead of the SISO decoder. Third, a modification of the processing schedule is made for higher operating efficiency. Two designs with parallel architecture have been implemented. The first design with 32 SISO decoders, each of which processes 2 symbols per cycle, has 160 Mb/s and 0.22 nJ/b/iter after measurement. The second design uses 16 SISO decoders to deal with 4 symbols per cycle and achieves 100% efficiency, leading to 1000 Mb/s and 0.15 nJ/b/iter in post-layout simulation.},

pages={2273-2282}, 
abstract={A compact low-power phased array receiver with continuous beam steering is presented based on the subsector beam steering technique. The entire beam steering range is divided into five subsectors from four characteristic beams of the Butler matrix. In each subsector the receive beam is steered by weighted combination of the received signals from array antennas. The theory of beam steering is detailed and the relationship of the steered angle with the beam steering factors is derived. The proposed architecture has lower circuit complexity and less power consumption because no challenging CMOS 360° variable phase shifters and multi-phase voltage-controlled oscillators are required. The phased array MMIC implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS technology has 17-21 dB receiving gain and 8.9-10.7 dB noise figure in 25-26 GHz. It consumes lower than 30 mW and takes a small chip area of 1.43 mm2. The continuous beam steering is demonstrated over the spatial range from -90° to +90°.},

pages={391-400}, 
abstract={A pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) uses switched-capacitor stages that settle in two steps that occur sequentially in time. The first step of settling places charge onto the load capacitance using charge pumps, and the second fulfills the settling requirements using typical negative feedback around an operational amplifier. Hence, the design combines the efficiency of a fast charge-transfer phase with the gain and noise-immunity advantages of amplifier-driven settling. Improved conversion efficiency results from a higher ratio of current delivered to the load to that consumed in static biasing. Additional circuitry constrains critical amplifier node voltages during the charge transfer, facilitating a graceful transition to amplifier-driven settling. The two-step settling technique is demonstrated in a 2.5 bit/stage 10-bit pipelined ADC that consumes 11.1 mW while sampling a 21.3 MHz input signal at 42 MS/s. The resulting SNDR is 55.6 dB (ENOB = 8.94) and the SFDR is 67.5 dB.},

pages={167-177}, 
abstract={Attaching a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) on the inner liner of a tire allows sensing of important additional technical parameters, such as vehicle load or tire wearout. The maximum weight of the sensor is limited to 5 grams including package, power supply, and antenna. Robustness is required against extreme levels of acceleration. The node size is limited to about 1 cm3 to avoid high force-gradients due to device-deformation and finally, a long power supply lifetime must be achieved. In this paper a low-power FSK transceiver is presented. Exploiting BAW resonators the use of a bulky and shock-sensitive crystal and a PLL can be avoided. This makes the system more robust and radically reduces the start-up time to 2 Â¿s from few ms as in state-of-the-art crystal oscillator based systems. The current consumption of the transceiver is 6 mA in transmit mode with a transmit output power of 1 dBm and 8 mA in receive mode with a sensitivity of -90 dBm at a data rate of 50 kBit/s and a bit error rate of 10-2. The transceiver ASIC and a microcontroller ASIC, a MEMS sensor, and a BAW die are arranged in a 3-D chip stack for best compactness, lowest volume, and highest robustness. The sensor node allows sensing of pressure, acceleration, supply voltage and temperature.},

abstract={A 201.4 GOPS real-time multi-object recognition processor is presented with a three-stage pipelined architecture. Visual perception based multi-object recognition algorithm is applied to give multiple attentions to multiple objects in the input image. For human-like multi-object perception, a neural perception engine is proposed with biologically inspired neural networks and fuzzy logic circuits. In the proposed hardware architecture, three recognition tasks (visual perception, descriptor generation, and object decision) are directly mapped to the neural perception engine, 16 SIMD processors including 128 processing elements, and decision processor, respectively, and executed in the pipeline to maximize throughput of the object recognition. For efficient task pipelining, proposed task/power manager balances the execution times of the three stages based on intelligent workload estimations. In addition, a 118.4 GB/s multi-casting network-on-chip is proposed for communication architecture with incorporating overall 21 IP blocks. For low-power object recognition, workload-aware dynamic power management is performed in chip-level. The 49 mm2 chip is fabricated in a 0.13 Â¿m 8-metal CMOS process and contains 3.7 M gates and 396 KB on-chip SRAM.

abstract={An ultralow-power super-regenerative receiver for BFSK modulated signals has been designed and fabricated in a standard 0.18-μm CMOS process. The use of BFSK modulation allows the receiver to operate at higher data rates and also gives an approximate 3-dB SNR performance increase over the more traditional OOK modulation. A fast calibration scheme and the absence of an external inductor make it ideal for ultralow-power sensor networks. A power consumption of 215 μW from a 0.65-V supply and an area of 0.55 mm2 make it ideal for highly integrated energy harvesting sensor nodes. At 2 Mb/s, the receiver consumes 0.18 nJ/b, making it the lowest energy integrated super-regenerative receiver to date.},

abstract={An output-capacitorless low-dropout regulator (LDO) with a direct voltage-spike detection circuit is presented in this paper. The proposed voltage-spike detection is based on capacitive coupling. The detection circuit makes use of the rapid transient voltage at the LDO output to increase the bias current momentarily. Hence, the transient response of the LDO is significantly enhanced due to the improvement of the slew rate at the gate of the power transistor. The proposed voltage-spike detection circuit is applied to an output-capacitorless LDO implemented in a standard 0.35-Â¿m CMOS technology (where VTHN Â¿ 0.5 V and VTHP Â¿ -0.65 V). Experimental results show that the LDO consumes 19 Â¿A only. It regulates the output at 0.8 V from a 1-V supply, with dropout voltage of 200 mV at the maximum output current of 66.7 mA. The voltage spike and the recovery time of the LDO with the proposed voltage-spike detection circuit are reduced to about 70 mV and 3 Â¿s, respectively, whereas they are more than 420 mV and 30 Â¿s for the LDO without the proposed detection circuit.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2030-2037}, 
abstract={Complex non-constant-envelope modulations are often used in wireless communications. A power amplifier (PA) is developed based on the concept of pulsed load modulation (PLM) that can enhance the power efficiency of the PA when the output power is back off from the peak due to modulations. The PLM technique utilizes the time-varying behavior of switched resonators to form an optimal, power dependent load impedance. The switched resonator consists of a balanced pair of switching mode PAs that drive a high-Q bandpass filter. In addition to its efficiency enhancement through PLM, the PA is able to preserve the linearity of complex modulations through the architecture of envelope delta-sigma modulation (EDSM). In this paper, a 1.87 GHz PLM power amplifier is fabricated with a pair of 0.35 μm GaAs pHEMT devices. The duty cycle tests show its significant improvement on power efficiency at different back-off levels over traditional Class-B amplifiers. The PA module is also tested with a single-channel WCDMA signal with peak to average ratio (PAR) of 10.8 dB. It has achieved 39 dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) at 5 MHz offsets without needing additional linearization techniques. The power added efficiency in this case is 43% including the loss of the output filter and 52.6% if the loss of the filter is de-embedded.},

abstract={A transformer-based high-order output matching network is proposed for broadband power amplifier design, which provides optimum load impedance for maximum output power within a wide operating frequency range. A design methodology to convert a canonical bandpass network to the proposed matching configuration is also presented in detail. As a design example, a push-pull deep class-AB PA is implemented with a third-order output network in a standard 90 nm CMOS process. The leakage inductances of the on-chip 2:1 transformer are absorbed into the output matching to realize the third-order network with only two inductor footprints for area conservation. The amplifier achieves a 3 dB bandwidth from 5.2 to 13 GHz with 25.2 dBm peak and 21.6% peak PAE. The EVM for QPSK and 16-QAM signals both with 5 Msample/s are below 3.6% and 5.9% at the output 1 dB compression point. This verifies the PA's capability of amplifying a narrowband modulated signal whose center-tone can be programmed across a large frequency range. The measured BER for transmitting a truly broadband PRBS signal up to 7.5 Gb/s is less than 10 , demonstrating the PA's support for an instantaneous wide operation bandwidth.},

abstract={An architectural attenuation-predistortion linearization scheme for a wide range of operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) is proposed and demonstrated with a transconductance-capacitor (G<sub>m</sub>-C) filter. The linearization technique utilizes two matched OTAs to cancel output harmonics, creating a robust architecture. Compensation for process variations and frequency-dependent distortion based on Volterra series analysis is achieved by employing a delay equalization scheme with on-chip programmable resistors. An OTA design with the proposed broadband linearization method has third-order inter-modulation (IM3) distortion better than -74 dB up to 350 MHz with 0.2V¿¿¿¿ input, 70 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 1 MHz bandwidth, and 5.2 mW power consumption. The distortion-cancellation technique enables an IM3 improvement of up to 22 dB compared to a commensurate OTA without linearization. A proof-of-concept low-pass filter with the linearized OTAs has a measured IM3 < - 70 dB and 54.5 dB dynamic range over its 195 MHz bandwidth.

The ETF's phase shift is determined by its geometry and by the thermal diffusivity of bulk silicon (D). The temperature dependence of is compensated for with the help of die-temperature information obtained by an on-chip band-gap temperature sensor.

abstract={Self-powered microsystems like wireless microsensors and biomedical implants derive power from in-package minibatteries that can only store sufficient energy to sustain the system for a short life. The environment, however, is a rich source of energy that, when harnessed, can replenish the otherwise exhausted battery. The problem is harvesters generate low power levels and the electronics required to transfer the energy to charge a battery can easily demand more than the power produced. This paper presents how a 1 × 1 mm2 0.7-μm BiCMOS vibration-supplied electrostatic energy-harvesting system IC produces usable energy. The IC charges and holds the voltage across a vibration-driven variable capacitor CVAR so that ambient kinetic energy can induce CVAR to generate current into the battery when capacitance decreases, as the plates separate. The precharger, harvester, monitoring, and control microelectronics draw enough power to operate, yet allow the system to yield (experimentally) 1.27, 2.14, and 2.87 nJ per vibration cycle for battery voltages at 2.7, 3.5, and 4.2 V, which at 30 Hz produce 38.1, 64.2, and 86.1 nW. Experiments further show that the harvester system prototype charges 1 μF (emulating a small thin-film Li Ion) from 3.5 to 3.81 V in 35 s.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={1}, 
pages={69-83}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated flexible ultra-low power UWB impulse radio receiver, capable of cm-accurate ranging. Ultra-low-power consumption is achieved by employing the quadrature analog correlating receiver architecture, by exploiting the duty-cycled nature of the system, by operating in the sub-1 GHz band as well as by careful circuit design. Two pulse rates, 39.0625 Mpulses per second (Mpps) and 19.531 Mpps, and a wide range of processing gains (0-18 dB) are supported. Also, the acquisition algorithm and accuracy can be adapted at run time. This flexible implementation allows to dynamically trade power consumption for performance depending on the operating conditions and the application requirements. The receiver prototype was manufactured in 130 nm CMOS and the active circuit area measures 4.52 mm2. The IC contains a complete analog front-end, digital backend and implements the algorithms necessary for acquisition, synchronization, data reception and ranging. Consuming 4.2 mW when operating at 39.0625 Mpps, it achieves an energy efficiency of 108 pJ/pulse. A 1.3 Mb/s wireless link over more than 10 m in an office-like environment has been demonstrated under direct line-of-sight (LOS) conditions with a raw packet-error-rate (PER) less than 10% and cm-accurate ranging.},

abstract={Conventional continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma (Â¿Â¿) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) consume large amount of power in operational amplifiers of a loop-filter. We propose a new loop-filter with single-opamp resonator, ringing-relaxation filter and passive resistor adder to lower power consumption. These three techniques are essential for designing high-order delta sigma modulators with low oversampling ratio. Because the new resonator reduces the number of opamps, the resistor adder displaces a conventional active adder and the ringing-relaxation filter alleviates the burden on the first opamp by reducing its gain bandwidth, FOM is greatly improved. To demonstrate the concept, 300 MHz, fifth-order low-pass, 3-bit CTÂ¿Â¿ ADC of single feedback with feedforward architecture was implemented in a 1.1 V, 110 nm 1P6M CMOS process. An SNR of 68.2 dB and an SNDR of 62.5 dB were measured in a 10 MHz bandwidth and FOM was 0.24 pJ/conv.},

pages={2283-2291}, 
abstract={This paper presents a technique to reduce the quantization error in fractional division for a wideband fractional-N frequency synthesizer. By using a direct digital synthesis phase accumulator as the fractional divider and a DAC as the phase-to-pulse converter, the quantization error can be much smaller than the one by conventional sigma-delta modulated multi-modulus divider. With small quantization error, a dedicated compensation mechanism is no longer necessary for wide loop bandwidth applications. To demonstrate this concept, a prototype chip was implemented with 0.18-μm CMOS. The synthesizer consumes 19 mA from a 1.8 V supply. With 1 MHz closed-loop bandwidth, the in-band noise is -98 dBc/Hz and the 3 MHz offset noise is -122 dBc/Hz for a 1.8 GHz output. The output exhibited 27 dB phase noise reduction compared to the generic sigma-delta structure. The settling time is 2 μs under a 35 MHz frequency step.},

abstract={A wirelessly powered patch-type healthcare sensor IC is presented for a wearable body sensor network (W-BSN) to continuously monitor personal vital signals. Thick-film electrodes are screen printed on a fabric by planar-fashionable circuit board (P-FCB) technology on which stainless steel powder with a grain size of 100 μ m is added to reduce both contact impedance as well as motion artifacts. A nested chopped amplifier (NCA) is designed and optimized for the proposed patch-type healthcare sensor with a reduced electrode referred noise of 0.5 μVrms. A programmable gain and bandwidth amplifier (PGA) stage is also implemented to accommodate various dynamic ranges of vital signals. A 10-b folded successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) reduces capacitive digital-to-analog conversion size by 94% and relaxes the power budget of the ADC driver by 36%. Measured sensor resolution is 9.2 b and rejects common-mode interference larger than 100 dB while consuming only 12 μ W of power supplied wirelessly. A 2.0 mm × 1.3 mm sensor IC is fabricated in 0.18-μm 1P6M CMOS technology. The chip is directly integrated between two screen printed electrodes and stacked by a screen printed fabric inductor.

Using an abstract model for the TDC, this paper presents a dithering method which is mathematically shown to suppress fractional tones, in conjunction with a feedforward dither cancellation technique which suppresses dither-induced phase noise. A mostly-digital calibration algorithm is also presented which ensures consistent phase noise cancellation across PVT conditions. The aforementioned techniques are implemented in a 65 nm digital CMOS prototype running at 3.5 GHz from a 35 MHz reference.

number={10}, 
pages={2184-2197}, 
abstract={A cascode configuration in class-E CMOS power amplifiers (PAs) provides high reliability with respect to breakdown considerations. However, it causes a power loss due to the slow transition of a common-gate device from the triode region to the cut-off region. To minimize the power loss of cascode class-E CMOS PAs, we propose a charging acceleration technique, CAT. This method incorporates a capacitive element between the drain and the source of a common-gate device in a cascode configuration, accelerating the charging speed responsible for turning off a common-gate device instantly after a common-source device is turned off and thus minimizing power loss from the device. We compared the performance of the proposed cascode class-E PA to that of the conventional cascode class-E PA using a 0.18- CMOS process. With a 3.3-V power supply, the proposed fully-integrated CMOS PA achieves 30.7 dBm of maximum output power and 45.6% of power-added efficiency (PAE) with a dynamic range of 40 dB at 1.6 GHz. According to measurements, the proposed cascode class-E PA shows improvement in PAE over the conventional class-E PA of between 5% and 9% in a 1.5 to 2.0 GHz range.},

year={2010},

pages={1822-1833}, 
abstract={This paper presents a distributed multi-phase oscillator based on left-handed LC-ring. In contrast to traditional designs that couple multiple LC-tanks through MOSFETs, it uses an LC-ring as a single high-order resonator that generates multi-phase resonant signal. By avoiding coupling MOSFETs which deteriorate phase noise significantly, it can synthesize multiple phases while maintaining the same phase-noise figure-of-merit (FoM) as a single-stage LC oscillator. This also provides a systematic way of trading power for phase noise. The dynamics and the phase noise of the LC-ring oscillator are analyzed based on a mode-decomposition model. We also address the duality of left-/right-handed resonator in the context of oscillator in detail. These analysis was verified by prototypes in a 0.13 μm CMOS process with 0.5 V supply voltage: a four-stage LC-ring oscillator at 5.12 GHz draws 8 mA current and achieves a phase noise of -121.6 dBc/Hz@600 kHz, while a single-stage one at 5.34 GHz draws 2 mA and achieves -116.1 dBc/Hz@600 kHz.

Based on the proposed technique, a 4-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) prototype, which consists of a resistor string and a unity-gain buffer, is developed. The DAC is implemented by using an 8-Â¿m a-Si NTFT process. Operated at a supply voltage of 25 V, the fabricated circuit consumes a dc power of 3.68 mW.

abstract={This paper describes a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter designed in a complementary SiGe BiCMOS SOI process. The high-performance complementary BJTs lead to a switched-current approach to the signal processing. Although it uses a fairly traditional four-stage pipeline architecture, several techniques are incorporated to achieve 16 bits of distortion performance at a sample rate of up to 160 MHz. For improved high input frequency linearity we describe a track and hold with a sampling instant modulation scheme. For stability of the current-mode DAC over signal swing and temperature we describe a scheme to increase the output impedance of the first sub-DAC. At a sample clock frequency of 122 MHz, prototype silicon exhibits a spurious-free dynamic range of 100 dBc through the first two Nyquist zones and a signal-to noise ratio of 77 dB. With a 160 MHz sampling clock, the measured SFDR is better than 90 dBc and the SNR is better than 74.5 dB. The ADC dissipates 1.6 W from 5 V and 3.3 V supplies.},

abstract={Hardware encryption engines are essential components of secure systems. They are widely used in desktop applications such as the trusted platform module as well as in mobile applications where they offer high energy efficiency compared to their software implementation counterparts. Unfortunately, ASIC encryption engines leak side-channel information through their power supplies. This information can be used by attackers to reveal their secret keys with attacks such as differential power analysis. Dual-rail logic and noise addition circuits increase the security against these attacks, but they add higher than 3x overheads in area, power, and performance to unsecured encryption engines. In this work, we present a switched capacitor circuit that equalizes the current to isolate the critical encryption activity from the external supplies, eliminating the side-channel information leakage. The secure encryption system was implemented in a 0.13 Â¿m CMOS technology with 7.2% area and 33% power overheads and a 2 Ã performance degradation. The secret encryption key was not revealed after ten million side-channel attacks.},

abstract={This paper presents an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) for the 2.4-GHz ISM band frequency synthesis. The ADPLL is built around a digitally controlled LC oscillator. In the feedback path, a high-speed topology is employed for the variable phase accumulator to count full cycles of the RF output. A simple technique based on a short delay line in the reference signal path allows the time-to-digital converter core to operate at a low duty cycle with about 95% reduction of its average power consumption. To allow direct frequency modulation, the ADPLL incorporates a two-point modulation scheme with an adaptive gain calibration. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS, the ADPLL has an active area of 0.24 mm2. Measured phase noise at 1-MHz offset is -120 dBc/Hz with a power consumption of 12 mW, and -112 dBc with power consumption lowered to 8 mW. The integrated phase noise of the ADPLL is measured to be 1.7° rms.},

In this way, the image produced from a radio-telescope using such advanced components has a higher resolution and therefore allows scientists to obtain a clearer representation of the environment. The low-noise amplifier is the key component of a high sensitivity receiver (demonstrating a very low noise figure, even in the millimeter-wave frequency region). Such electrical performance is obtained from the combined use of an advanced technology (fT and fmax > 250 GHz, LG <; 0, 1 μm) and appropriate design methodologies that take into account electrical specifications and system constraints in the context of the targeted application. In this contribution, we will present both the performance of the employed technology (OMMIC 70 nm GaAs mHEMT) and the related low-noise design methodologies that have led to the realization of four different LNAs operating from 5 GHz up to 100 GHz and beyond.},

abstract={This paper presents a compact 0.18-Â¿m CMOS wideband gain-flattened low noise amplifier (LNA). The low noise characteristic of the LNA is achieved by the noise canceling technique and the gain flatness is enhanced by the gate-inductive gain-peaking technique. In addition to extending flat-gain bandwidth, the proposed gain-peaking technique results in better wideband noise canceling and quick gain roll-off outside the desired signal band to reject interference. Without using any passive inductor, the core size of the fully-integrated CMOS LNA circuit is only 145 Â¿ m Ã 247 Â¿ m. The measured gain and noise figure of the CMOS LNA are 16.4 dB and 2.1 dB, respectively. The gain variation of the LNA is Â±0.4 dB from 50 to 900 MHz.

title={A Dynamic Phase Error Compensation Technique for Fast-Locking Phase-Locked Loops}, 
year={2010}, 
volume={45}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1137-1149}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fast-locking technique for phase-locked loops (PLLs). In the proposed technique, the polarity and magnitude of the phase error at the phase-frequency detector (PFD) input is continuously monitored during the locking process. The detected phase error is then coarsely compensated by dynamically changing the divide ratio of the frequency divider. The proposed method allows the PLL to maintain a small phase error throughout the frequency acquisition process, thereby reducing the settling time. To further enhance the locking speed, an auxiliary charge pump is employed to supply currents to the loop filter during the fast-locking mode to facilitate a rapid frequency acquisition. The proposed technique is incorporated in the design of a 5-GHz PLL. Fabricated in the TSMC 0.18-μm CMOS technology, the whole PLL dissipates 11 mA from a 1.8-V supply. The measured settling time is considerably improved over previous bandwidth-switching method. At 5.34 GHz, the phase noise measured at 1-MHz offset is -114.3 dBc/Hz, and the reference spurs at 10-MHz offset are lower than -70 dBc.},

abstract={This paper presents a set of circuit techniques to achieve high data rate point-to-point communication over long on-chip RC-limited wire-pairs. The ideal line termination impedances for a flat transfer function with linear phase (pure delay) are derived, using an s-parameter wire-pair model. It is shown that a driver with series capacitance on the one hand and a resistive load on the other, are fair approximations of these ideal terminations in the frequency range of interest. From a perspective of power efficiency, a capacitive driver is preferred, as the series capacitance reduces the voltage swing along the line which reduces dynamic power consumption. To reduce cross-talk and maintain data integrity, parallel differential interconnects with alternatingly one or two twists are used. In combination with a low offset dynamic sense amplifier at the receiver, and a low-power decision feedback equalization technique with analog feedback, gigabit communication is demonstrated at very low power consumption. A point-to-point link on a 90 nm CMOS test chip achieves 2 Gb/s over 10 mm long interconnects, while consuming 0.28 pJ/bit corresponding to 28 fJ/bit/mm, which is much lower than competing designs.},

abstract={An 87.7 mm2 1.6 GB/s 128 Mb chain FeRAM with 130 nm 4-metal CMOS process is demonstrated. In addition to small bitline capacitance inherent to chain FeRAM architecture, three new FeRAM scaling techniques - octal bitline architecture, small parasitic capacitance sensing scheme, and dual metal plateline scheme - reduce bitline capacitance from 100 fF to 60 fF. As a result, a cell signal of Â±220 mV is achieved even with the small cell size of 0.252 Â¿m2. An 800 Mb/s/pin read/write bandwidth at 400 MHz clock is realized by installing SDRAM compatible DDR2 interface, and performance is verified by simulation. The internal power-line bounce noise due to 400 MHz clock operation is suppressed to less than 50 mV by an event-driven current driver, which supplies several hundreds of mA of current within 2 ns response. The precise timing and voltage controls are achieved by using the data stored in a compact FeRAM-fuse, which consists of extra FeRAM memory cells placed in edge of normal array instead of conventional laser fuse links. This configuration minimizes area penalty to 0.2% without cell signal degradation.},

With an 11-bit combined DAC, the prototype DDFS produces a minimum spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 52 dBc from dc up to Nyquist frequency when clocked at 1.3 GHz. This 90-nm CMOS chip occupies 2 mm2 including bond pads and dissipates 350 mW with a 1.2-V digital supply and 2.5-V analog supply. The FOM of this chip is measured at 1207.9 GHz ·2 ENOB /W .},

abstract={A hybrid supply modulator consisting of a parallel operation of a high-drive, low output impedance, wideband class-AB linear amplifier and a high-efficiency, wideband, low-ripple switching amplifier is presented for the application of polar transmitters. At system level, a two-phase switching is employed to lower the inductor current ripple so that both the output ripple and power loss are reduced. On-chip feed-forward bandpass filter is used to extend the tracking bandwidth of the switching amplifier, without hurting the stability of parallel control loop or the need to increase switching frequency. At circuit level, the output impedance of the linear amplifier is lowered by optimizing the design of super source-follower output stage. Inductor current sharing and two-phase ramp generator are implemented for realizing the two-phase switching scheme. Fabricated in a 0.35-μm CMOS process, the prototype chip measures 9 % static efficiency improvement over the conventional single-phase switching design in the back-off power level. Dynamic efficiency is enhanced by 8-12% by enabling the bandpass filter. Successful tracking of a 4 MHz 0.4-2.8 V full-wave rectified sine wave and a WCDMA envelope signal is demonstrated.},

abstract={A 32-Mb SPin-transfer torque RAM (SPRAM) chip was demonstrated with an access time of 32 ns and a cell write-time of 40 ns at a supply voltage of 1.8 V.

A required thermal stability of 67 of the TMR device was estimated by taking into account the disturbances during read operations and data retention periods of 10 years for nonvolatile operation. The 32-Mb SPRAM chip features three circuit technologies suitable for a large-scale array: 1) a two-transistor, one-resistor (2T1R) type memory cell for achieving a sufficiently large write current despite the small cell size, 2) a compact read/write separated hierarchy bit/source-line structure with a localized bi-directional write driver for efficiently distributing write current, and 3) a '1'/'0' dual-array equalized reference scheme for stable read operation.},

abstract={This paper presents a system-on-chip passive RFID tag with an embedded temperature sensor for the EPC Gen-2 protocol in the 900-MHz UHF frequency band. A dual-path clock generator is proposed to support both applications with either very accurate link frequency or very low power consumption. On-chip temperature sensing is accomplished with a time-readout scheme to reduce the power consumption. Moreover, a gain-compensation technique is proposed to reduce the temperature sensing error due to process variations by using the same bandgap reference of the tag to generate bias currents for both the current-to-digital converter and the clock generator of the sensor. Also integrated is a 128-bit one-time-programmable (OTP) memory array based on gate-oxide antifuse without extra mask steps. Fabricated in a standard 0.18- μm CMOS process with analog options, the 1.1-mm2 tag chip is bonded onto an antenna using flip-chip technology to realize a complete tag inlay, which is successfully demonstrated and evaluated in real-time wireless communications with commercial RFID readers. The tag inlay achieves a sensitivity of -6 dBm and a sensing inaccuracy of ±0.8° C (3 σ inaccuracy) over operating temperature range from -20°C to 30°C with one-point calibration.},

This epiretinal prosthesis system consists of a power telemetry subsystem to deliver 100 mW power, a data telemetry subsystem to transfer 2 Mbps data, digital controllers to decode stimulation patterns, and a 256-channel stimulator to generate user programmable bi-phasic current stimuli. In this study, dual-band telemetry is adopted to achieve both high power efficiency and high data rate. Frequencies of 2 and 22 MHz are chosen for power and data carrier frequencies, respectively. A mixed-mode and multiple-voltage design is applied to the stimulator for withstanding a high-compliance voltage of ± 10 V at the output stage as well as for reducing the area of each pixel. To add flexibility to the stimulator, each pixel has a local digital controller, which enables the stimulator IC to generate 256 parallel stimulations with various pulse widths and amplitudes. The chip is fabricated in TSMC 0.18 μm 32 V CMOS process with 256 area pads constructed above the stimulus current drivers.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of an analog-front-end (AFE) integrated into a DSP-based transceiver for both serial 10 Gbps KR-backplane and long-reach-multimode-fiber (LRM) applications. The receiver consists of a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a 6-bit 4-way time-interleaved ADC, which is digitally calibrated to compensate for the offset, gain and phase mismatches between the interleaved channels. With a 5 GHz input signal, the ADC achieves overall SNDR of 29 dB, while the measured SNDR of flash sub-ADC is 31.6 dB. The power efficiency FoM of the complete interleaved ADC is 1.4 pJ per conversion step. The PLL uses a calibrated LC-VCO and the TX features a full-rate 3-tap de-emphasis at the output. Inductively tuned buffers connected in tandem are employed to distribute the 10 GHz clock. Random and deterministic jitter measured at the TX output are 0.38 psrms and 2.65 pspp, respectively. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology, the AFE occupies an area of 3 mm2 and consumes 500 mW from a 1 V supply. BER of less than 10-15 is measured over legacy backplanes with 26 dB loss at Nyquist and the measured transceiver optical sensitivity is less than -13 dBm for all four LRM stressors, exceeding both the KR and the LRM specifications.},

abstract={A low-energy inductive coupling transceiver is proposed for Cm-range multimedia data transmission in mobile device applications. The Transmission Time Control (TTC) scheme is proposed to reduce the transmitter energy consumption to 0.475 pJ/b, and the Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) scheme is adopted to make the receiver energy consumption be 0.825 pJ/b. The planar-type inductor with self-resonance frequency of about 200 MHz fabricated on the flexible substrate achieves a data rate over 50 Mbps. To compensate for the weakly coupled channel, the receiver sensitivity is enhanced by the differential detection method (DDM) of the nodal voltages across the receiver inductor. With this method, the communication distance is increased up to 7 cm, and channel misalignment tolerance is enhanced up to 2 cm. The proposed transceiver is implemented within 1.5 × 2.37 mm2 in 0.18-μ m CMOS process and operates with 1-V supply.},

abstract={Two very compact and low power quadrature receivers for ZigBee applications are presented. Area and power savings are obtained through both current reuse and oscillator tank sharing between the I and Q paths. Since this choice can cause I and Q amplitude/phase mismatches, the conversion gain is analyzed and a technique to minimize these errors is implemented. Moreover, since using a single tank makes quadrature generation at the local oscillator level costly and power-hungry, two alternative quadrature generation techniques in the RF path are proposed, together with the corresponding input matching strategies.},

pages={989-997}, 
abstract={A feedback interference cancellation circuit is presented that uses a control loop to reject blockers in wireless receivers. The concept is based on a feedback translational loop which subtracts a blocker replica from the original blocker signal. In contrast to feedforward methods loop selectivity does not depend on exact gain matching of two paths but on the open loop gain which is easier to adjust. The concept is described including the theoretical derivations of the transfer function and stability. Nonidealities like I/Q mismatch and noise mechanisms are discussed. Finally, measurements from a prototype chip in 65-nm CMOS are presented showing the feasibility of active feedback cancellation. In a desensitization scenario, gain drops by more than 12 dB for a -15 dBm blocker at 20 MHz offset without feedback interference cancellation while a gain degradation of merely 3 dB is measured with feedback interference cancellation enabled.},

year={2010}, 
volume={45},

pages={2044-2056}, 
abstract={This paper presents a precision general-purpose current-feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) that employs a combination of ping-pong auto-zeroing and chopping to cancel its offset and 1/f noise. A comparison of offset-cancellation techniques shows that neither chopping nor auto-zeroing is an ideal solution for general-purpose CFIAs, since chopping results in output ripple, and auto-zeroing is associated with increased low-frequency noise. The presented CFIA mitigates these unintended side effects through a combination of these techniques. A ping-pong auto-zeroed input stage with slow-settling offset-nulling loops is applied to limit the bandwidth of the increased noise to less than half of the auto-zeroing frequency. This noise is then modulated away from DC by chopping the input stage at half the auto-zeroing frequency, reducing the low-frequency noise to the 27 nV/ white-noise level, without introducing extra output ripple. The auto-zeroing is augmented with settling phases to further reduce output transients. The CFIA was realized in a 0.5 μm analog CMOS process and achieves a typical offset of 2.8 μV and a CMRR of 140 dB in a common-mode voltage range that includes the negative supply.},

pages={707-718}, 
abstract={We have developed a 6b 2.7 GS/s folding ADC with on-chip background self-calibration in 90 nm CMOS technology. The ADC achieves high-speed operation of 2.7 GS/s at low power consumption of 50 mW from a 1.0 V power supply and the figure of merit (FOM) is 0.47 pJ/conversion-step. The key technique is a digital background self-calibration architecture which compensates for the large mismatch of small devices in the ADC and also corrects the ADC characteristics degradation during operation due to the drift of environmental factors such as temperature. This background calibration technique suited for multi-GHz operation is realized by two-channel ADC architecture and digital smoothing technique, which uses averaging of two comparator offsets and reconfiguration of reference connection. To minimize the power dissipation, a cascade-calibrated folding-interpolating architecture has been developed. It reduces the overall analog power of our design by 50%, compared with a conventional architecture which applies calibration only to preamplifiers. By utilizing these low-power techniques, we have successfully developed a low-power ADC with all functions including the background self-calibration control circuit.},

abstract={An auto-reconfigurable 2×/3× switched-capacitor charge pump (SC-CP) for transcutaneous power transmission is presented in this paper. The proposed SC-CP can automatically configure its own voltage conversion ratio according to different input voltages by using the adaptive control circuitry such that the DC/DC regulator can maintain high power efficiencies under coupling variations. In addition, a dynamic dead-time control scheme and a minimum capacitance selection strategy are developed to improve the power efficiency of the proposed SC-CP through minimizing the shoot-through current and maximizing its average output voltage, respectively. Implemented in a standard 0.35-μm n-well CMOS process, the proposed SC-CP achieves peak power efficiencies of 95% (2 ×) and 92% (3 ×). The quiescent current consumption of the charge pump has been reduced by 1.6 times (2 ×) and 2.3 times (3 ×) with the dynamic dead-time control. The power efficiency of the DC/DC regulator with the proposed SC-CP is also improved by > 25%, compared to that using the conventional 3×SC-CP, when the input voltage varies from 1.6 V to 2.4 V.},

abstract={The substrate resistance of 45 nm CMOS devices shows a strong dependence on the distance between the device edge and the substrate contact ring, as well as on the number of sides that the surrounding ring contacts the substrate.

At mm-wave frequencies, the unilateral power gain is affected by Rsx through the drain-body capacitance pole, and the unilateral power gain deviates from the ideal -20 dB/dec slope.

pages={1427-1435}, 
abstract={High efficiency Class-D speaker drivers have become ubiquitous in battery driven mobile audio applications. Analog switching errors and timing jitter are known limitations to the dynamic range in these types of switching audio drivers. To overcome these limitations the Class-D architecture chosen in this paper provides a low 667 kHz pulse rate. This architecture is based on a 4th-order digital modulator with pulse-width modulation (PWM) feedback. The modulator loop processes the PWM signals at a high 24 MHz clock rate, and provides pulse edge timing resolution within a single clock period of the high-rate clock. Timing distortion errors due to uniform sampling of the low-rate PWM signals are reduced with the high forward loop gain of the digital modulator feedback loop. The driver receives a 22-bit digital audio input and combines the functionality of a high-fidelity digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with a speaker driver. It achieves 120 dB dynamic range over a 20 kHz bandwidth, provides 88% power efficiency while driving an 8 Ω speaker load, and consumes a total quiescent current of 2.4 mA.},

abstract={A 2 × 25-Gb/s receiver for 100-Gb Ethernet (100 GbE) has been implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. A new regulation mechanism is applied to the limiting amplifier to minimize its gain and bandwidth variations. Two low-power full-rate CDRs (with a built-in clock generator) and a high-speed 2:5 DMUX circuit are integrated. Although only two channels are implemented, this receiver provides exactly the same operation as a four-channel one while dealing with independent channels. The prototype achieves bit error rate <;10-12 with 20-mVpp input sensitivity, consuming a total power of 510 mW from a 1.2-V supply.},

abstract={An output-capacitorless low-dropout regulator (LDO) compensated by a single Miller capacitor is implemented in a commercial 90-nm CMOS technology. The proposed LDO makes use of the small transistors realized in nano-scale technology to achieve high stability, fast transient performance and small voltage spikes under rapid load-current changes without the need of an off-chip capacitor connected at the LDO output. Experimental result verifies that the proposed LDO is stable for a capacitive load from 0 to 50 pF (estimated equivalent parasitic capacitance from load circuits) and with load capability of 100 mA. Moreover, the gain-enhanced structure provides sufficient loop gain to improve line regulation to 3.78 mV/V and load regulation to 0.1 mV/mA, respectively. The embedded voltage-spike detection circuit enables pseudo Class-AB operation to drive the embedded power transistor promptly. The measured power consumption is only 6 μW under a 0.75-V supply. The maximum overshoot and undershoot under a 1.2-V supply are less than 66 mV for full load current changes within 100-ns edge time, and the recovery time is less than 5 μs.},

abstract={This paper presents a 10 bit successive approximation ADC in 65 nm CMOS that benefits from technology scaling. It meets extremely low power requirements by using a charge-redistribution DAC that uses step-wise charging, a dynamic two-stage comparator and a delay-line-based controller. The ADC requires no external reference current and uses only one external supply voltage of 1.0 V to 1.3 V. Its supply current is proportional to the sample rate (only dynamic power consumption). The ADC uses a chip area of approximately 115×225 μm2. At a sample rate of 1 MS/s and a supply voltage of 1.0 V, the 10 bit ADC consumes 1.9 μW and achieves an energy efficiency of 4.4 fJ/conversion-step.},

abstract={MEMS-based oscillators have recently become a topic of interest as integrated alternatives are sought for quartz-based frequency references. When seeking a programmable solution, a key component of such systems is a low power, low area fractional-N synthesizer, which also provides a convenient path for compensating changes in the MEMS resonant frequency with temperature and process. We present several techniques enabling efficient implementation of this synthesizer, including a switched-resistor loop filter topology that avoids a charge pump and boosts effective resistance to save area, a high gain phase detector that lowers the impact of loop filter noise, and a switched capacitor frequency detector that provides initial frequency acquisition. The entire synthesizer with LC VCO occupies less than 0.36sq. mm in 0.18 m CMOS. Chip power consumption is 3.7 mA at 3.3 V supply (20 MHz output, no load).},

abstract={This paper describes a System on Chip implementation of a reconfigurable digital signal processor. The device is suitable for execution of a wide range of applications exploiting a balanced mix of heterogeneous reconfigurable fabrics merged together by a flexible and efficient communication infrastructure based on a 64-bit Network On Chip. The SoC combines a fine grain embedded FPGA, a mid grain configurable processor and a coarse grain reconfigurable array. An ARM processor featuring a resident operating system is the SoC supervisor, managing communication, synchronization and reconfiguration mechanisms. This computational model enables the programmer to manage the high level synchronization and global data of complex signal processing applications through the ARM processor, while allocating most critical computational kernels to the most suitable reconfigurable engines. The SoC has been fabricated in 90-nm technology, the die area being 110 mm2; it integrates 97 million transistors and has a peak power consumption of 2.5 W. In order to demonstrate the proposed computational model and the reconfigurable signal processor capabilities in a real test case, a video surveillance motion detection application was implemented in the SoC. When running this application, the device proved able to deliver 120 GOPS dissipating 1.45 W.},

abstract={A compact, low power and global-mismatch-tolerant 0.8-6 GHz fractional-N PLL is designed to cover IEEE 802.11abg, PCS/DCS and cellular bands. Two new techniques are proposed to cancel the in-band quantization noise and fractional spurs. Firstly, a second order binary-weighted digital/analog differentiator (DAD) is utilized to enable the second order mismatch shaping and reduce the quantization noise by 25 dB, along with advantages of compact circuit implementation with smaller routing area and less power consumption over those of dynamic element matching (DEM) based counterparts. Secondly, mechanisms causing fractional spurs are also identified and a third order offset-frequency delta-sigma (Δ-Σ) modulator is devised to decrease the in-band spurs by 20 dB in simulation and 8 dB in present single-ended circuit implementation.},

abstract={We present an on-chip reliability monitor capable of separating the aging effects of hot carrier injection (HCI), bias temperature instability (BTI), and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) with high frequency resolution. This task is accomplished with a pair of modified ring oscillators (ROSCs) which are representative of standard CMOS circuits. We use a ¿¿backdrive¿¿ concept, in which one ROSC drives the voltage transitions in both structures during stress, such that the driving oscillator ages due to both BTI and HCI, while the other suffers from only BTI. In addition, long term or high voltage experiments facilitate TDDB measurements in both oscillators. Sub-¿¿s measurements are controlled by on-chip logic in order to avoid excessive unwanted BTI recovery during stress interruptions. Sub-ps frequency resolution is achieved during these short measurements using a beat frequency detection system, and we automate the experiments through a simple digital interface. Measurement results are presented from a 65 nm test chip over a range of stress conditions.},

abstract={A 20 GS/s 6b time-interleaved ADC is implemented in 32 nm CMOS SOI with an embedded time-to-digital converter to sense timing skew, and the randomness of process mismatch is exploited to compensate for the clock misalignment and dynamic offset errors of comparators that occur during high-speed operation. To achieve low-power consumption at high-speed operation with small-size transistors, a low-complexity on-chip calibration reduces gain, offset, and delay mismatches in background. With the timing skew calibration, the spurs due to clock misalignment are reduced by 20 dB. The proposed ADC achieves an SNDR of 30.7 dB at Nyquist frequency and consumes only 69.5 mW with a figure-of-merit of 124 J/conv-step.},

abstract={Clock and data recovery (CDR) systems are the first logic blocks in serial data receivers and the latter's performance depends on the CDR. In this paper, a 100 Gbit/s CDR designed in 130 nm BiCMOS SiGe is presented. The CDR uses an injection locked oscillator (ILO) which delivers the 100 GHz clock. The inherent phase shift between the recovered clock and the incoming data is compensated by a feedback loop which performs phase and frequency tracking. Furthermore, a windowed phase comparator has been used, first to lower the classical number of gates, in order to prevent any delay skews between the different phase detector blocks, then to decrease the phase comparator operating frequency, and furthermore to extend the ability to track zero bit patterns The measurements results demonstrate a 100 GHz clock signal extracted from 50 Gb/s input data, with a phase noise as low as 98 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier frequency. The rms jitter of the 25 GHz recovered data is only 1.2 ps. The power consumption is 1.4 W under 2.3 V power supply.},

abstract={A high-resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) using switched-ring oscillators (SROs) is presented. Leveraging oversampling and noise shaping, the proposed SRO-TDC achieves high resolution without the need for calibration. Ring oscillators are switched between two frequencies to achieve noise shaping of the quantization error in an open-loop manner. By decoupling the sampling clock and input carrier frequencies, SRO-TDC is capable of operating at high oversampling ratios (OSRs). This paper also discusses different noise sources and quantization/device noise tradeoffs in noise-shaping TDCs and presents techniques to characterize TDC linearity, range, and noise performance. Fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, the proposed TDC operates over a wide range of input carrier frequencies (0.6-750 MHz) and sampling rates (50-750 MS/s). At 500 MS/s and 80 MHz carrier frequency, it achieves an integrated noise of 315 fs in a 1 MHz bandwidth while consuming 1.5 mW from a 1 V supply. The SRO-TDC occupies an active die area of only 0.02 mm2.},

abstract={Early-stage damage detection for bridges requires continuously sensing strain over large portions of the structure, yet with centimeter-scale resolution. To achieve sensing on such a scale, this work presents a sensing sheet that combines CMOS ICs, for sensor control and readout, with large-area electronics (LAE), for many-channel distributed sensing and data aggregation. Bonded to a structure, the sheet thus enables strain sensing scalable to high spatial resolutions. In order to combine the two technologies in a correspondingly scalable manner, non-contact interfaces are used. Inductive and capacitive antennas are patterned on the LAE sheet and on the IC packages, so that system assembly is achieved via low-cost sheet lamination without metallurgical bonds. The LAE sheet integrates thin-film strain gauges, thin-film transistors, and long interconnects on a 50-μm-thick polyimide sheet, and the CMOS ICs integrate subsystems for sensor readout, control, and communication over the distributed sheet in a 130 nm process. Multi-channel strain readout is achieved with sensitivity of 18 μStrain RMS at a readout energy of 270 nJ/measurement, while the communication energy is 12.8 pJ/3.3 pJ per bit (Tx/Rx) over a distance of 7.5 m.},

abstract={Low-power applications, such as sensing, are becoming increasingly important and demanding in terms of minimizing energy consumption, driving the search for new and innovative interface architectures and technologies. Carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for further energy reduction, as CNFET-based digital circuits are projected to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product compared with silicon-CMOS at highly scaled technology nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to imperfections and variations such as those induced by mispositioned and metallic CNTs. These substantial imperfections and variations have prevented the demonstration of complex CNFET circuits until now. This paper presents the first demonstration of a subsystem, which is a complete capacitive sensor interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made possible by: 1) a digitally oriented interface architecture and 2) the imperfection-immune design paradigm, which combines design and processing techniques to successfully overcome CNT imperfections and variations. In addition to electrical measurements, we demonstrate correct operation of our CNFET circuitry by interfacing it with a sensor used to control a handshaking robot.},

abstract={We propose a fully-integrated temperature sensor for battery-operated, ultra-low power microsystems. Sensor operation is based on temperature independent/dependent current sources that are used with oscillators and counters to generate a digital temperature code. A conventional approach to generate these currents is to drop a temperature sensitive voltage across a resistor. Since a large resistance is required to achieve nWs of power consumption with typical voltage levels (100 s of mV to 1 V), we introduce a new sensing element that outputs only 75 mV to save both power and area. The sensor is implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS and occupies 0.09 mm 2 while consuming 71 nW. After 2-point calibration, an inaccuracy of + 1.5°C/-1.4°C is achieved across 0 °C to 100 °C. With a conversion time of 30 ms, 0.3 °C (rms) resolution is achieved. The sensor does not require any external references and consumes 2.2 nJ per conversion. The sensor is integrated into a wireless sensor node to demonstrate its operation at a system level.},

abstract={In order to realize a digital system with no distinction between “on” and “off,” the computational state must be stored in nonvolatile memory elements. If the energy cost and time cost of managing the computational state in nonvolatile memory can be lowered to the microsecond and picojoule-per-bit level, such a system could operate from unreliable harvested energy, never requiring a reboot. This work presents a nonvolatile D-flip-flop (NVDFF) designed in 0.13- μm CMOS that retains state in ferroelectric capacitors during sporadic power loss. The NVDFF is integrated into an ASIC design flow, and a test-case nonvolatile FIR filter with an accompanying power management unit automatically saves and restores the state based on the status of a one-bit indicator of energy availability. Correct operation has been verified over power-cycle intervals from 4.8 μs to 1 day. The round-trip save-restore energy is 3.4 pJ per NVDFF. Also presented are statistical measurements across 21 thinspace000 NVDFFs to validate the capability of the circuit to achieve the requisite 10-ppm failure rate for embedded system applications.},

This paper presents the first low-cost, ultra-low power, passive RFID tag, fully integrated on a single substrate in a standard CMOS process. The system combines a 24 GHz, dual on-chip antenna, RF front-end, and a C-Flash based, rewritable, non-volatile memory module to achieve full on-chip system integration. The complete system was designed and fabricated in the TowerJazz 0.18 μm CMOS technology without any additional mask adders. By embedding the RF, memory, and digital components together upon a single substrate in a standard digital process, the low-cost aspirations of the “5-cent RFID tag” become feasible. Design considerations, analysis, circuit implementations, and measurement results are presented. The entire system was fabricated on a 3.6 mm × 1.6 mm (6.9 mm2) die with the integrated antennas comprising 82% of the silicon area. The total read power was measured to be 13.2 μW, which is sufficiently supplied by the on-chip energy harvesting unit.},

abstract={A circuit allowing to accurately measure the average output current of the step-down DC-DC converter operating in PWM mode is presented. It relies on the measurement of the average voltage drop across the PMOS-NMOS or dual-NMOS power stage. The average voltage drop is measured by a simple RC filter, as a difference between the power-stage average output voltage and the average output voltage of an auxiliary “ideal” power stage. Obtained voltage drop is applied to an element labeled as “composite load”. This approach allows to remove the dominant errors originating from the use of a standard sense-FET circuit. Obtained output current image exhibits very low linearity error <;1% in 10 mA to 2.1 A range, and high ±4% accuracy of the conversion gain over supply voltage, temperature and statistical chip-by-chip variations.

pages={740-750}, 
abstract={Dual dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) techniques employed in single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converters are used to improve the efficiency of the system-on-a-chip (SoC). One DVS technique for digital circuits is controlled by the SoC processor. This paper presents the analog DVS (ADVS) technique for analog circuits to scale voltage across the power MOSFET of the switchable digital-analog (D/A) low-dropout (LDO) regulator which is the post-regulator cascaded in series with the SIDO converter. The ADVS determines the tradeoff between voltage suppression and efficiency. Furthermore, because of the digital operation of the D/A LDO regulator, the quiescent current is further reduced at light loads while the load current requirement is minimized. In addition, the limitation of the capacitor-free LDO is significantly reduced by a few microamperes. The test chip was fabricated using a 40-nm CMOS process. Experimental results demonstrated switchable D/A LDO regulator operation with peak efficiency at 96.7% in analog operation and a 5-mV output voltage ripple at 120-mA load resulting from the advantage of ripple suppression. The power efficiency could be sustained at a value over 92.57% even when the load current decreased to 1 μA.},

abstract={A burst-mode transmitter achieves 6 ns turn-on time by utilizing a fast frequency settling ring oscillator in digital multiplying delay-locked loop and a rapid on-off biasing scheme for current mode output driver. The resistor tuning-based ring oscillator avoids the use of bias voltages and thereby eliminates the related settling time overhead. The calibrated rapid on-off biasing circuit utilizes a fast charging technique to achieve bias voltage settling time of 4 ns, resulting in 30X improvement over a diode-connected bias circuit. Fabricated in 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 2.29 mW/Gb/s energy efficiency at peak data rate of 8 Gb/s. A 125X (8 Gb/s to 64 Mb/s) change in effective data rate results in 67X (18.29 mW to 0.27 mW) change in transmitter power consumption corresponding to only 2X (2.29 mW/Gb/s to 4.24 mW/Gb/s) degradation in energy efficiency for 32 byte long data bursts. We also present an analytical bit error rate (BER) computation technique for rapid on-off links, which uses MDLL settling measurement data in conjunction with always-on transmitter measurements. This technique indicates that the BER bathtub width for 10-12 BER is 0.65 UI and 0.72 UI during rapid on-off operation and always-on operation, respectively.},

abstract={A novel comparator placing scheme and reference ladder concept are presented for flash analog-to-digital converters (ADC), that minimize the dynamic reference voltage distortions at high signal speed. No track-and-hold or time interleaving is used in the ADC, which reduces the design complexity and minimizes the conversion latency. The data input signal is buffered by an emitter follower (EF) and distributed by a passive transmission line (TML) tree to the comparators. The EF and comparators are systematically optimized with respect to the energy efficiency and design considerations for the trade off between dynamic linearity and power dissipation are given in detail. The TML tree is designed such that in spite of inhomogeneous loading by the comparators equal transfer functions are achieved along all paths. The ADC achieves without calibration or correction an effective resolution beyond 3.7 bits up to 10 GHz signal frequency and 20 GS/s sampling. With 1.0 W of power dissipation the conversion efficiency is 3.9 pJ per conversion step, which sets a record for single-core ADCs beyond 10 GS/s Nyquist rate.},

abstract={A low-energy single-ended duobinary transceiver is proposed for the point-to-point DRAM interface with an energy efficiency of 0.56 pJ/bit at 7 Gb/s. The transmitter power is reduced by decreasing the signal swing of transmission channel to 80 mV and replacing the multiplexer and the binary output driver in the transmitter by a duobinary output driver. A trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) is used at the receiver end of transmission channel. The TIA works as a receiver termination and also amplifies the input signal for subsequent processing. Analysis of the feedback loop delay and the nonlinearity of the TIA shows that they do not impose serious problems. The TIA output signal is applied to a duobinary-to-NRZ converter, which is implemented by using a direct feedback 1-tap DFE circuit with a tap-coefficient of 1.0. The reference voltage of the duobinary-to-NRZ converter is calibrated automatically to enable a small-swing signaling. The proposed transceiver chip in a 65 nm CMOS process works at 4.5 Gb/s with a 3" FR4 microstrip line, and at 7 Gb/s with a 0.6" FR4.},

abstract={We introduce a new class of feedback amplifiers, called switched-mode operational amplifiers (SMOAs) that address voltage-swing limitations of classical feedback amplifiers in scaled CMOS technologies. By exploiting the increased timing resolution available in scaled CMOS, SMOAs encode analog signal information in the time domain and provide near-rail-to-rail output-signal swing, high output-stage efficiency and better linearity. A 4th-order, 70 MHz continuous-time active-RC Butterworth filter is presented in 65 nm CMOS to demonstrate the advantages of SMOAs. The filter consumes 25.4 mW from a 0.6 V supply and achieves 55.8 dB peak SNDR while operating at a full-scale of 873 mV ppd. Thanks to SMOAs, the full-scale (73% of the 0.6 V supply voltage) and the bandwidth are respectively, a 2.5 × and 6.2 × improvement over other state-of-the-art low-voltage filters.},

abstract={A highly linear LNA is implemented in a 0.18 μm SOI CMOS process for 1 GHz SAW-less receiver applications. To achieve lower noise figure (NF) than conventional simultaneous noise and input matching methods, a capacitive loading based simultaneous noise and input matching technique reducing the NF degradation coming from a lossy gate inductor has been devised. In addition, in order to improve both the 1 dB gain compression point (CP1dB) and the third-order intercept point (IP3) without sacrificing NF, a large-signal transconductance linearization method adopting body-bias control and complementary-superposition is proposed.

abstract={A low-power multi-functional electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processor is presented in this paper. To enable long-term monitoring, several architecture-level power saving techniques are proposed, including global cognitive clocking, pseudo-downsampling wavelet transform, adaptive storing, and denoising-based run-length compression. An ultra-low-voltage ADC is designed for low-power signal digitization with adaptive clocking. Through these architecture-level techniques, the total power consumption can be significantly reduced by 63% as compared to the conventional design. Several circuit-level design techniques are also developed, including ultra-low-voltage operation and near-threshold level shifting, to further reduce the power consumption by 33%. In addition, a low-complexity cardiac analysis scheme is proposed to realize comprehensive on-chip cardiac analysis. Implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS process, the proposed cognitive ECG processor consumes only 457 nW at 0.5 V for real-time ECG recording and diagnosis.},

title={A 10 bit SAR ADC With Data-Dependent Energy Reduction Using LSB-First Successive Approximation}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2825-2834}, 
abstract={This paper presents a successive approximation (SA) algorithm called LSB-first SA and a corresponding 10 bit ADC implementation. The energy per conversion and number of bitcycles per conversion used by this algorithm both scale logarithmically with the activity of the input signal, such that an N-bit conversion uses between 2 and 2N+1 bitcycles, compared to N for conventional binary SA. This algorithm reduces ADC power consumption when sampling signals with low mean activity. The ADC is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. With a 0.6 V supply, the maximum sample rate, leakage power, and ENOB are 16 kHz, 0.58 nW, and 9.73 b, averaged over 10 test chips. The DNL and INL are bounded at 0.09 and 0.22 LSBs. Given a DC input, the ADC achieves its best-case FoM of 3.5 fJ/conversion-step. Given a fullscale Nyquist sinusoid input, the ADC has its worst-case FoM of 20 fJ/conversion-step. The supply voltage can be increased to 1.0 V to reach a sample rate of 450 kHz, or decreased to 0.5 V to achieve a 2.9-17 fJ/conversion-step FoM range.},

pages={2575-2587}, 
abstract={In this paper, we propose a discrete-time IIR low-pass filter that achieves a high-order of filtering through a charge-sharing rotation. Its sampling rate is then multiplied through pipelining. The first stage of the filter can operate in either a voltage-sampling or charge-sampling mode. It uses switches, capacitors and a simple gm-cell, rather than opamps, thus being compatible with digital nanoscale technology. In the voltage-sampling mode, the gm-cell is bypassed so the filter is fully passive. A 7th-order filter prototype operating at 800 MS/s sampling rate is implemented in TSMC 65 nm CMOS. Bandwidth of this filter is programmable between 400 kHz to 30 MHz with 100 dB maximum stop-band rejection. Its IIP3 is +21 dBm and the averaged spot noise is 4.57 nV/√Hz. It consumes 2 mW at 1.2 V and occupies 0.42 mm2.},

When a 16QAM signal is transmitted and the TX-VCO is heavily pulled, the calibration improves the modulation mask by over 15 dB and lowers the transmitted EVM from 11% to 2.4%. Furthermore, the presented calibration technique suppresses unwanted sidebands caused by a mutual pulling between the TX-VCO and another nearby oscillator by more than 20 dB, where center frequencies of the two 4 GHz oscillators are spaced by only 3 MHz.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49},

pages={248-261}, 
abstract={Neural probes have become the most important tool for enabling neuroscientists to place microelectrode sensors close to individual neurons and to monitor their activity in vivo. With such devices, it is possible to perform acute or chronic extracellular recordings of electrical activity from a single neuron or from groups of neurons. After the many developments in neural implants, it has become clear that large arrays of electrodes are desirable to further investigate the activity performed by complex neural networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a CMOS neural probe containing 455 active electrodes in the probe shank (100 μm wide, 10 mm long, and 50 μm thick) and 52 simultaneous readout channels in the probe body (2.9 × 3.3 mm2). In situ amplification under each electrode enables low-impedance interconnection lines, regardless of the electrode impedance, with a residual crosstalk of -44.8 dB. This design has been implemented in a 0.18-μm standard CMOS technology, with additional CMOS-compatible post-processing performed at wafer level to define the electrodes and the probe outline. In this architecture, the analog front-end achieves an input-referred noise of 3.2 μVrms and an NEF of 3.08. The power consumption of the core circuit is 949.8 μW, while the total power consumption is 1.45 mW. The high-density active-electrode array in this neural probe allows for the massive recording of neural activity. In vivo measurements demonstrate successful simultaneous recordings from many individual cells.},

year={2014},

number={3}, 
pages={718-728}, 
abstract={This paper presents a feed-forward power-supply noise cancellation technique to achieve high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) in single-ended class-D audio amplifiers. To show the effectiveness of the technique, it is implemented on a first-order single-ended pulse-width modulation (PWM) class-D amplifier. The implemented technique improves the PSRR from 20 Hz to 20 kHz independently of the close-loop compensator's filter-order. The design methodology, implementation, and tradeoffs for the proposed technique are provided. The fabricated class-D audio amplifier achieves a PSRR of 83 dB at 217 Hz, THD+N of 0.0149%, and a maximum efficiency of 94.6% from a 1.8-V power supply. Experimental results show a PSRR improvement of 33 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz compared to a similar amplifier designed without the technique. The prototype was implemented using 0.18- μm CMOS standard technology, and occupies a total area of 0.121 mm2. The total quiescent power consumption was 356 μW. The feed-forward power-supply noise cancellation technique enhances single-ended structures to achieve a PSRR performance comparable to differential architecture, and at the same time it consumes small quiescent power with a reduced active silicon area overhead.},

abstract={A fully integrated switched capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) with on-die high density MIM capacitor, distributed across a 14 KB register file (RF) load is demonstrated in 22 nm tri-gate CMOS. The multi-conversion-ratio SCVR provides a wide output voltage range of 0.45-1 V from a fixed input voltage of 1.225 V. It achieves 63-84% conversion efficiency and supports a maximum load current density of 0.88 A/mm2. The area overhead of the dedicated SCVR on the load is 3.6%. Measured data is presented on various performance indices in detail. Subsequent learning on tradeoffs between various factors like capacitance characteristics, conversion efficiency and current density are delineated and, correlated with theoretical estimates. Performance of RF array shows comparable results when powered with the SCVR and the external rail. The all-digital, modular design allows efficient spatial distribution across the load and hence robust power delivery. The extremely fast response times in the order of few nanoseconds is targeted to benefit agile power management. This work evinces voltage regulator technology as a standard homogenous CMOS component, which can proliferate DVFS domains for maximum energy and area benefits.},

title={A Recursive Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Converter Achieving $2^{N}-1$ Ratios With High Efficiency Over a Wide Output Voltage Range}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2773-2787}, 
abstract={A Recursive Switched-Capacitor (RSC) topology is introduced that enables reconfiguration among 2 N-1 conversion ratios while achieving minimal capacitive charge-sharing loss for a given silicon area. All 2 N-1 ratios are realized by strategically interconnecting N 2:1 SC cells either in series, in parallel, or in a stacked configuration such that the number of input and ground connections are maximized in order to minimize cascaded losses. Importantly, all ratios are dynamically reconfigurable without disconnecting a single capacitor, all while ensuring optimal capacitance/conductance relative-sizing. The RSC topology is inherently regular, enabling recursive inter-cell connection and recursive binary-slicing that implement ratio-reconfiguration with minimum complexity and losses. A scalable all-digital binary search controller is employed to perform ratio-reconfiguration among the available 2 N-1 ratios without using any ratio-threshold generation circuitry. To validate the topology, a 4 bit RSC is fully integrated in 0.25 μm bulk CMOS using MIM capacitors, achieving greater than 70% efficiency over a 0.8-2.2 V output voltage range with 85.8% peak-efficiency from a 2.5V input supply. Compared to a co-fabricated three-ratio (1/3, 1/2, 2/3) Series-Parallel SC converter, the RSC achieves a 40.4% larger output operating range (from 0.04 to 2.2 V), and fills the efficiency-drops in-between the three-ratios by 8% with a 940 Ω load.},

Using the right combination of voltage and time domain information, the proposed ADC architecture benefits from improved resolution and power efficiency, with MSBs resolved in voltage domain and LSBs in time domain. The measured results of the prototype ADC implemented in a 0.13 μm CMOS demonstrate peak SNDR of 69.3 dB at 6.38 mW power and 70 MHz sampling frequency.

abstract={This paper presents a 900 MHz highly digital transmitter capable of providing band shaped QPSK/16-QAM modulation for high data-rate applications with high energy efficiency. Injection-locked ring oscillator is used for multi-phase carrier generation which eliminates the use of power-hungry phase-locked loop. It also provides fast settling time that enables heavy duty cycling to maximize energy conservation. Direct modulation at power amplifier is adopted to simplify the transmitter architecture. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the transmitter achieves maximum data rate of 50 Mbps/100 Mbps for QPSK/16-QAM with effective sideband suppression more than 38 dB. The chip occupies an active area of 0.08 mm and achieves a settling time of less than 88 ns. Under 0.77 V supply, it achieves an energy efficiency of 26 pJ/bit and 13 pJ/bit with and without band shaping respectively. The measured EVM is better than 6% for QPSK (at 50 Mbps) and 16-QAM (at 100 Mbps) while delivering -15 dBm of output power.},

abstract={In a conventional bio-sensor, key signal features are acquired using Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital conversion without exploiting the typical bio-signal characteristic of sparsity in some domain (e.g., time, frequency, etc.). Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing paradigm that exploits this sparsity for commensurate power savings by enabling alias-free sub-Nyquist acquisition. In a severely energy constrained sensor, CS also eliminates the need for digital signal processing (DSP). A fully-integrated low-power CS analog front-end (CS-AFE) is described for an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor. Switched-capacitor circuits are used to achieve high accuracy and low power. Implemented in 0.13 μm CMOS in 2×3 mm2, the prototype comprises a 384-bit Fibonacci-Galois hybrid linear feedback shift register and 64 digitally-selectable CS channels with a 6-bit C-2C MDAC/integrator and a 10-bit C-2C SAR ADC in each. Clocked at 2 kHz, the total power dissipation is 28 nW and 1.8 μW for one and 64 active channels, respectively. CS-AFE enables compressive sampling of bio-signals that are sparse in an arbitrary domain.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS time-of-flight (TOF) 3-D camera employing a column-level background light (BGL) suppression scheme for high-resolution outdoor imaging. The use of the column-level approach minimizes a pixel size for high-density pixel arrays. Pixel-binning and super-resolution can be adaptably applied for an optimal BGL suppression at given spatiotemporal resolutions. A prototype sensor has been fabricated by using 0.11 μm CMOS processes. The sensor achieved a fill factor of 24% in a pixel pitch of 5.9 μm which is the smallest among all the reported TOF cameras up to date. Measurement results showed the temporal noise of 1.47 cm-rms with a 100 ms integration time at a demodulation frequency of 12.5 MHz using a white target at 1 m distance. The non-linearity was measured as 1% over the range of 0.75 m ~ 4 m. The BGL suppression over 100 klx was achieved from indoor and outdoor experiments, while the BGL-induced offset was maintained less than 2.6 cm under 0 ~ 100 klx.},

A prototype delay line designed for the 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB range achieves a delay range of 140 ps and a gain range of -30 dB to +10 dB. Fabricated in a 0.25 μm SiGe BiCMOS process, the delay element occupies an active area of 1 mm2 and consumes 53 mW from a 2.5 V supply.

abstract={This paper presents a wireless transceiver intended for insect-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The transceiver utilizes several design techniques developed to meet the challenging low power and low size requirements in insect-based WSNs. The techniques include current reuse in the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and power amplifier (PA), fast PLL on/off switching for low-power on/off keying (OOK) modulation, and switching between transmit and receive (TX/RX) modes without an off-chip switch. Also, the VCO, PA, low noise amplifier (LNA), OOK modulator, and TX/RX switch are co-designed and integrated into a single block to reduce the system complexity significantly. The transceiver is designed and fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. The transmitter provides an output power in the range of -30 dBm to -4.4 dBm while consuming an average power of 1.2 mW to 4.5 mW. The phase locked-loop (PLL) does not use a high-Q external resonator, and its phase noise depends on the PA output power because of the current reuse in the VCO and PA. The PLL phase noise at 1 MHz offset at 2.4 GHz varies from -103.3 dBc/Hz to -116.7 dBc/Hz. The receiver achieves a sensitivity of -90 dBm at 1 Mbps data rate for a BER = 0.1%. An example wireless sensor node design utilizing the proposed wireless transceiver achieves a modest weight of 1 gram, and a small form factor of 12.5 mm × 12.5 mm.},

abstract={We present a new millimeter-wave power-combining technique using transmission-line baluns which both connect transistor outputs in series and inductively tune the transistor output capacitances. The baluns are much shorter than a quarter-wavelength (λ/4), hence are more compact and have less insertion loss than a λ/4 balun. We introduce one topology providing an even number of series connections, including 2:1 and 4:1, and a second topology providing either an even or odd number of series connections. We then analyze segmented transformer power-combiners as a set of multi-conductor transmission-lines, and explore the relationship between transformer and transmission-line balun power-combiners. We demonstrate the technique with 2:1 and 4:1 series-connected designs implemented in a 0.25 μm InP HBT process. At 86 GHz, a single-stage power amplifier (PA) using the 2:1 baluns exhibits 30.4% peak PAE, 20.37 dBm output power (Pout) and 23 GHz 3-dB bandwidth from a 448 × 816 μm 2 die. A two-stage PA using the 2:1 baluns exhibits 30.2% PAE, and 23.14 dBm Pout from an 824 × 816 μm 2 die. At 81 GHz, a two-stage PA with 4:1 series output power-combining exhibits 23.4% PAE, and 26.7 dBm (470 mW) Pout from a 1,080 × 980 μm 2 die.},

Gate drivers with programmable frequency (5 kHz-2.048 MHz), duty cycle and dither for active and passive cell balancing is provided. On-chip 3.3 V and 5.2 V LDOs power the various subsystems. To eliminate external components, the ICs uses current-mode signaling which allows the IC to be directly connected to one another to transmit information about cells from the top of the stack to the host. The IC consumes less than 15 μA of quiescent current.},

abstract={This paper presents a 0.6 V input, 0.3-0.55 V output buck converter in 40 nm CMOS, for low-voltage low-power wireless sensor network systems. A low power CCM/DCM controller of the buck converter enables automatic selection of DCM or CCM operation depending on load situation, therefore improving the power efficiency. A dual-mode-body-biased (DMBB) zero-crossing detector with both forward body bias mode and zero body bias mode is designed to enable DCM operation with both low supply voltage and normal supply voltage. An ultra-low-power hysteresis voltage detector is proposed for body bias modes selection. The proposed buck converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94% with an output current range of 50 μA to 10 mA. Thanks to the DCM operation, the efficiency at an output current of 10 μA is improved by 20% and 9%, with an output voltage of 0.35 V and 0.5 V, respectively.},

abstract={An 82 mW fully integrated stereo ground-referenced headphone module is designed in 40 nm CMOS. Lower platform cost is enabled by integrating the headphone module on the same SoC as the baseband functions. Maintaining device reliability with direct battery hook-up and providing large output swing are major challenges for this work, and several techniques were employed to guarantee safe operation for all of the devices under various conditions. Area reduction techniques were utilized to reduce the die cost and achieve lower platform cost. The module supports direct battery hookup with a battery range from 3.1 to 4.5 V and achieves a minimum low frequency, i.e., 217 Hz, PSRR of 110 dB at the lowest battery voltage. Audio quality is preserved by achieving a dynamic range of 100 dB, THD+N of -84 dB at 10 mW output power, and 160 μV pop-and-click noise level during power-up and power-down.

abstract={An antenna load impedance detection and automatic tuning technique is presented. An antenna load impedance detection circuit as well as burst detector enabling autonomous tuning is integrated on a CMOS-PA chip. A low-loss impedance tuner with an SOI switch is also demonstrated. The proposed impedance detection circuit employs polar detection technique, so that the antenna impedance is tuned in a vector fashion to track the time-varying antenna impedance promptly. Also, it can operate with nonconstant envelope signal thanks to an introduced relative detection technique. At the back-off operation, the impedance can be automatically tuned to optimum value. The circuit is time shared with PA linearization loop, minimizing the overhead of the circuit. When the VSWR is approximately 2.5, the peak PAE is kept more than 40% with tuning, whereas it varies from 28% to 45% without tuning. The linear efficiency without the tuning is 15% as the worst case, while more than 30% of PAE is maintained when the tuning and PA-closed loop are enabled. The drain efficiency at 6 dB back-off is improved from 30% to 40%. The tuner can cover a VSWR of around 6, while achieving a loss ranging from 0.3 to 4.6 dB.},

abstract={This work demonstrates the first fabricated 1 Mb nonvolatile TCAM using 2-transistor/2-resistive-storage (2T-2R) cells to achieve >10× smaller cell size than SRAM-based TCAMs at the same technology node. The test chip was designed and fabricated in IBM 90 nm CMOS technology and mushroom phase-change memory (PCM) technology. The primary challenge for enabling reliable array operation with such aggressive cell is presented, namely, severely degraded sensing margin due to significantly lower ON/OFF ratio of resistive memories (~102 for PCM) than that of traditional MOSFETs (>105 ). To address this challenge, two enabling techniques were developed and implemented in hardware: 1) two-bit encoding and 2) a clocked self-referenced sensing scheme (CSRSS). In addition, the two-bit encoding can also improve algorithmic mapping by effectively compressing TCAM entries. The 1 Mb chip demonstrates reliable low voltage search operation (VDDmin ~750 mV) and a match delay of 1.9 ns under nominal operating conditions.},

This avoids the use of a local crystal oscillator, thus implementing a highly integrated low-cost wireless transceiver.

year={2014},

pages={766-782}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 10-bit column driver IC for active-matrix LCDs, with a proposed iterative charge-sharing based (ICSB) capacitor-string that interpolates two output voltages from a resistor-string DAC. Iterative mode change between a capacitive voltage division mode and a charge sharing mode in the ICSB capacitor-string interpolation suppresses the effect of mismatches between capacitors and that of parasitic capacitances; thus, a highly linear capacitor sub-DAC is realized. In addition, the area-sharing layout technique, which stacks the interpolation capacitor-string on top of the R-DAC area, reduces the driver channel size and extends the bit resolution of the gamma-corrected nonlinear main R-DAC. Consequently, the proposed ICSB capacitor-string interpolation scheme provides highly uniform channel performance by passively dividing the coarse voltages from the global resistor-string DAC with high area efficiency, and more effective bit resolution for nonlinear gamma correction. The prototype column driver IC was implemented using a 0.11-μm CMOS process. The area occupation of the DAC and buffer amplifier per channel is only 188 × 15 μm2, and the static power consumption is 0.9 μA/channel with no additional static power dissipation for the interpolation. The measured maximum DNL and INL are 0.25 LSB and 0.43 LSB, respectively. The measured maximum inter-channel DVO is 5.6 mV. The proposed chip achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of chip size and channel-to-channel uniformity.},

abstract={A bio-feedback iontophoresis controller IC is implemented into a fabric patch for transdermal drug delivery. An iontophoresis stimulator front-end (ISFE) can provide programmable stimulation current in the range of 16-512-μA amplitude, DC-500-Hz frequency, and 3% -100% duty cycle for controllable drug delivery. For safe and robust electrical stimulation, a failure detection circuit monitors the stimulation current to prevent overcurrent and stimulation voltage saturation. For bio-feedback operation, a dual-mode impedance sensor (DMIS) measures load and tissue impedances in the range of 5-50 kΩ and 5 Ω-1 kΩ, respectively. In the DMIS, the gain of a programmable gain amplifier and the injected current level of a chopper-modulated current source are automatically controlled to minimize power consumption. The proposed IC occupies 2.35 mm × 2.35 mm including pads in a 0.11-μm 1P6M CMOS technology and dissipates a peak power of 2.2 mW. The proposed IC is directly integrated on a 9 cm × 4 cm fabric circuit board together with a 6.2-mAh coin battery for convenient iontophoresis treatment. The proposed system provides a maximum dosage range of 87 mA·min, which is larger range than the 80- mA·min dosage range of a commercial iontophoresis patch. Using a reconfigurable tetra-polar electrode configuration, load and tissue impedances are measured during the iontophoresis treatment to provide bio-feedback. The proposed iontophoresis system is successfully verified by both in-vitro and in-vivo tests.},

abstract={A 9.2 GHz digital phase-locked loop (PLL) that realizes a peaking-free jitter transfer function is presented. In other words, the closed-loop transfer function of the proposed digital PLL does not possess a closed-loop zero and the PLL achieves fast settling without exhibiting overshoots. While most previously reported peaking-free PLLs require additional circuit components which may adversely affect clock jitter or increase hardware complexity, the presented PLL requires only a new type of digital loop filter. The analysis on the loop dynamics and design of the optimal loop filter are presented. As for the implementation, a low-power linear time-to-digital converter (TDC) is realized with a set of three binary phase-frequency detectors whose triggering clocks are dithered using a delta-sigma modulator and phase interpolators. A digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is implemented as a transformer-tuned LC oscillator whose frequency is set by a ratio between two digitally controlled currents. The digital PLL prototype, fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS, demonstrates 1.2 ps rms integrated jitter at 9.2 GHz and 1.58 μs settling time with 700 kHz bandwidth while dissipating 63.9 mW at a 1.2 V nominal supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a low-jitter, low-power and a small-area injection-locked all-digital PLL (IL-ADPLL). It consists of a dual-loop and a dual-VCO architecture in which one VCO (Replica) is placed in a TDC-less synthesizable ADFLL to provide continuous tracking of voltage and temperature variations. The other VCO (main) shares the control voltage with the replica VCO but is placed outside the loop and is injection-locked to lower its jitter and accurately set its frequency to the desired one. This approach avoids timing problems in the conventional ILPLL since the injection-locked VCO is placed outside the feedback loop. It also achieves a low power and a small area, due to the absence of a power hungry TDC and an area-consuming loop filter, while tracking any PVT variations. The IL-ADPLL is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process and measurement results show that it achieves a 0.7ps RMS jitter at 1.2 GHz while having 1.6 mW and 0.97 mW power consumption with and without intermittent operation resulting in an FOM of -243 dB. It also consumes an area of only 0.022 mm2 resulting in the best performance-area trade-off system presented up-to-date.},

abstract={A single-chip impulse radio radar transceiver that enables high-resolution reception with enhanced signal to noise ratio (SNR) is proposed. The radar transceiver, consisting of a spectrum adjustable transmitter and a 100-ps resolution 4-channel sampling receiver, successfully demonstrates in/outdoor human walk tracing, stride-rate, and respiration measurements. The 4-channel sampling receiver, which is robust against pulse distortion, utilizes track and hold samplers and integrators while sharing a single low noise amplifier. By adopting embedded control logic, the sampling receiver achieves control flexibility as well as improved performance. A repetitive reception mode can proportionally increase the SNR of the receive pulse at the cost of a longer pulse acquisition time. DC offset and low-frequency coherent noise problems caused by on-board control clock signals are resolved with the radar architecture. The single chip radar transceiver is fabricated in a 130-nm CMOS technology occupying a chip area of 3.27 mm 2. The measured results show that echo pulses are recovered with a centimeter range resolution while consuming 80 mA from a supply voltage of 1.2 V.},

abstract={For current-steering digital-to-analog converters (DACs), a technique utilizing dynamic-element-matching and digital return-to-zero, called DEMDRZ, is proposed to simultaneously suppress the mismatch- and transient-induced nonlinearity. In doing so, the usage of small-sized current sources and switches is possible, and the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and intermodulation distortion (IMD) for high signal frequencies can be improved. With the DEMDRZ technique, a 12-bit compact, low-power, high-speed, high-resolution DAC is implemented in TSMC 40 nm CMOS process. The DAC architecture, circuit, and layout designs are presented. The implemented DAC achieves 70 dB SFDR for signals over the 800 MHz Nyquist bandwidth at 1.6 GS/s and <; -61 dB IMD for signals over the 1.4 GHz Nyquist bandwidth at 2.8 GS/s. Further, it dissipates 40 mW with a single 1.2 V supply. The active area of the DAC is 0.016 mm 2 , which is less than 6% of other state-of-the-art 12-bit current steering DACs. Furthermore, the implemented DAC performs best with three common figure-of-merits (FoMs).},

abstract={This paper describes an asymmetric 6.4-Gb/s memory interface for a wide range of DIMM configurations for desktop and server applications. The link uses a fly-by quadrature forwarded clock to enable fast startup and power-mode transitions on the DRAM and per-bit timing adjustment on the controller to enable the high-speed signaling. Single-ended low-swing near-ground signaling (NGS) is introduced in order to minimize signaling power. Transmitter and receiver equalization are used on the controller, but not the DRAM, in order to save DRAM complexity and power. Architectural and circuit techniques are presented to address the complex signaling and timing environment encountered in the explored configurations. The implemented link achieves 6.4-Gb/s communication over a 3.5-in FR4 PCB trace with a dual-rank dual-in line memory module with better than 9.1-pJ/bit power efficiency for the entire chip.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1837-1847}, 
abstract={A ripple-based digital controller requires inductor current ripple as feedback signals and analog RC inductor current sensors can be used for sensing the ripple. However, the passive RC components are bulky to integrate on-chip and the digital controller cannot use the analog ripple for the control purpose unless extra ADCs are available to quantize the signal. Therefore, a digital inductor current sensor is presented in this paper for obtaining the ripple in the digital domain. As compared to the existing designs, the digital inductor current sensor does not require extra ADCs or knowledge of the inductor DCR. A ripple-based digital controller is designed to demonstrate how the digital sensor can be utilized. A digital frequency-lock-loop is also incorporated into the digital controller to alleviate the problem of variable switching-frequency that is commonly found in the ripple-based control scheme. Both the digital sensor and controller are fabricated in UMC 0.13 μm digital CMOS process with a small chip area of 220 μm×220 μm. Measurements results show that a 2 MHz (max. ±6.5% in variation) buck converter achieves load-transient responses of about 5 μs by using the digital controller. The peak efficiency is 91% at a nominal load current of 100 mA.},

pages={683-694}, 
abstract={Current pre-charging techniques are introduced to generate the reference in MDACs of pipeline ADCs. They are specifically applied to zero-crossing-based (ZCB) pipeline-SAR ADCs in this paper. The proposed reference pre-charge technique relaxes power and area requirements for reference voltage generation and distribution in ZCB Pipeline ADCs, by eliminating power-hungry low-impedance reference voltage buffers. Dynamic reference loading (DRL), a variant of current reference pre-charging, is further proposed to reduce the loading due to the reference capacitors leading to improvements in the ADC noise performance. A proof-of-principle reference pre-charged DRL ZCB Pipelined-SAR ADC, implemented in 65 nm CMOS, shows an SFDR/SNR/SNDR of 77 dB/70 dB/66 dB at 25 MHz, while consuming 4.8 mW at 50 MS/s for an FOM of 57 fJ/step. The ADC does not require any additional power and/or area for reference voltage generation and distribution.},

abstract={This work addresses the emerging need for investigating micro- and nano-devices by performing Impedance Spectroscopy with high-sensitivity yet at high bandwidth. To this goal a new circuital architecture has been implemented that overcomes the limitations of the classic transimpedance topology of noise and maximum operating frequency trade-off as well as of input capacitance stability concerns. Thanks to a two channel modulation/amplification/demodulation structure embedded into a feedback loop, high loop gain at all the working frequencies is obtained. Implemented in 0.35 μm CMOS, the IC works from 1 kHz up to 150 MHz, independently of the input capacitance value up to about 100 pF. The IC shows a resolution as good as 0.4 aF in the 100 kHz-150 MHz range (Vin = 1 V, BW = 50 Hz). The circuit directly provides two DC outputs proportional to the Real and Imaginary component of the DUT admittance so that no external lock-in structure or filter is required. The output bandwidth is adjustable from few tens of Hz up to 50 kHz, thus allowing both fast impedance tracking and high resolution impedance spectroscopy.},

year={2014},

pages={486-501}, 
abstract={This paper presents design techniques for a high power supply rejection (PSR) low drop-out (LDO) regulator. A bulky external capacitor is avoided to make the LDO suitable for system-on-chip (SoC) applications while maintaining the capability to reduce high-frequency supply noise. The paths of the power supply noise to the LDO output are analyzed, and a power supply noise cancellation circuit is developed. The PSR performance is improved by using a replica circuit that tracks the main supply noise under process-voltage-temperature variations and all operating conditions. The effectiveness of the PSR enhancement technique is experimentally verified with an LDO that was fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology with a power supply of 1.8 V. The active core chip area is 0.14 mm2, and the entire proposed LDO consumes 80 μA of quiescent current during operation mode and 55 μA of quiescent current in standby mode. It has a drop-out voltage of 200 mV when delivering 50 mA to the load. The measured PSR is better than -56 dB up to 4 MHz when delivering a current of 50 mA. Compared to a conventional uncompensated LDO, the proposed architecture presents a PSR improvement of 34 dB and 25 dB at 1 MHz and 4 MHz, respectively.},

abstract={An 8-channel closed-loop neural-prosthetic SoC is presented for real-time intracranial EEG (iEEG) acquisition, seizure detection, and electrical stimulation in order to suppress epileptic seizures. The SoC is composed of eight energy-efficient analog front-end amplifiers (AFEAs), a 10-b delta-modulated SAR ADC (DMSAR ADC), a configurable bio-signal processor (BSP), and an adaptive high-voltage-tolerant stimulator. A wireless power-and-data transmission system is also embedded. By leveraging T-connected pseudo-resistors, the high-pass (low-pass) cutoff frequency of the AFEAs can be adjusted from 0.1 to 10 Hz (0.8 to 7 kHz). The noise-efficiency factor (NEF) of the AFEA is 1.77, and the DMSAR ADC achieves an ENOB of 9.57 bits. The BSP extracts the epileptic features from time-domain entropy and frequency spectrum for seizure detection. A constant 30- μA stimulus current is delivered by closed-loop control. The acquired signals are transmitted with on-off keying (OOK) modulation at 4 Mbps over the MedRadio band for monitoring. A multi-LDO topology is adopted to mitigate the interferences across different power domains. The proposed SoC is fabricated in 0.18- μm CMOS and occupies 13.47 mm2. Verified on Long Evans rats, the proposed SoC dissipates 2.8 mW and achieves high detection accuracy (> 92%) within 0.8 s.},

abstract={A fully integrated 60 GHz frequency synthesizer with an in-phase injection-coupled quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (IPIC-QVCO) is proposed. Through a particular symmetrical coupling network formed by diode-connected transistors, the in-phase coupling is realized in the IPIC-QVCO, which reduces both phase noise and phase error. A compact inductor-less divider chain is designed to reduce power consumption. A self-correcting low spur charge pump is employed to reduce reference spur. A standalone 60 GHz IPIC-QVCO and a fully integrated PLL are implemented in standard 65 nm low power CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the QVCO covers a frequency range from 57.88 to 68.33 GHz while consuming 11.4 mW power from a 1.2 V supply. The phase noise of the QVCO is -92 ~ -95 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset. The FOM and FOM T of the QVCO are -178.1 ~ -179.7 and -182.5 ~ -184.1 dBc/Hz respectively. The tuning range of the frequency synthesizer is from 57.9 to 68.3 GHz, and the power consumption is 24.6 mW.

abstract={Continuous-time ΔΣ modulators (CTDSM) used in wireless systems need to process signals in the presence of interferers. Peaking in the Signal Transfer Function of a conventional design necessitates a higher in-band dynamic range to accommodate interferers. A filter up front solves this problem at the expense of increased power dissipation and degraded linearity of the signal chain. Embedding the filter in the modulator achieves the same objective in a power efficient manner, while improving out-of-band linearity and reducing active area. However, having the filter inside a ΔΣ loop can be problematic with respect to stability. We show that such a system can be stabilized in a robust manner without extra hardware. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW = 2 MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18 dB) and a second order Butterworth filter (4 MHz cutoff), show that the in-band/out-of-band IIP 3 improves by about 3/10 dB when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade, and achieves a similar dynamic range and consumes 25% lower power.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1303-1316}, 
abstract={To reject strong interference in excess of 0 dBm, a 4- element LO-phase shifting phased-array receiver with 8-phase passive mixers terminated by baseband capacitors is presented. The passive mixers upconvert both the spatial and frequency domain filtering from baseband to RF, hence realizing blocker suppression directly at the antenna inputs. A comprehensive mathematical model provides a set of closed-form equations describing the spatial and frequency domain filtering including imperfections. A prototype is realized in 28 nm CMOS. It exploits third harmonic reception to achieve a wide RF-frequency range from 0.6-4.5 GHz at 34-119 mW power dissipation, while also providing impedance matching. Out of the band/beam, a 1 dB-compression point as high as +12/+10 dBm has been measured. The 1-element noise figure over the RF-frequency range is 4-6.3 dB, while in-beam/band IIP3 values of 0- +2.6 dBm are measured. This proposed technique can be instrumental to make RF receivers more robust for interference, while still being flexibly tunable in frequency.},

abstract={A mm-wave digital transmitter based on a 60 GHz all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with wideband frequency modulation (FM) for FMCW radar applications is proposed. The fractional-N ADPLL employs a high-resolution 60 GHz digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO) and is capable of multi-rate two-point FM. It achieves a measured rms jitter of 590.2 fs, while the loop settles within 3 μs. The measured reference spur is only -74 dBc, the fractional spurs are below -62 dBc, with no other significant spurs. A closed-loop DCO gain linearization scheme realizes a GHz-level triangular chirp across multiple DCO tuning banks with a measured frequency error (i.e., nonlinearity) in the FMCW ramp of only 117 kHz rms for a 62 GHz carrier with 1.22 GHz bandwidth. The synthesizer is transformer-coupled to a 3-stage neutralized power amplifier (PA) that delivers +5 dBm to a 50 Ω load. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the transmitter prototype (including PA) consumes 89 mW from a 1.2 V supply.},

abstract={3840 × 2160 and 7680 × 4320 UHDTV formats deliver remarkably enhanced visual experience relative to high definition but in the meanwhile involve huge complexity and memory bandwidth requirements in video encoding. Especially, enlarged motion distances of UHDTV lead to additional difficulties in the implementation of motion estimation, which is originally the most critical bottleneck of an encoder. This paper presents a motion estimation processor design for H.264/AVC. A test chip is implemented in 40 nm CMOS. With algorithm and architecture co-optimization, the processor delivers a maximum throughput of 1.59 Gpixel/s for 7680 × 4320 48 fps video, at least 7.5 times faster than previous designs. The corresponding core power dissipation is 622 mW at 210 MHz, with energy efficiency improved by at least 23%. The chip's DRAM bandwidth requirement is also 68% lower than previous chips. With a maximum search range of ±211 (horizontal) by ±106 (vertical) around a predictive search center, the proposed motion estimation processor well accommodates the high motion of UHDTV.},

year={2014},

pages={2608-2617}, 
abstract={Present-day smartphones and tablets demand high audio fidelity (e.g., total harmonic distortion + noise, THD + N ≪ 0.01%), and high noise immunity (e.g., power supply rejection ratio, PSRR ≫ 80 dB) to allow high integration in an SoC. The design of conventional closed-loop pulse width modulation (PWM) Class-D amplifiers (CDAs) typically involves undesirable trade-offs between fidelity (qualified by THD + N), PSRR and switching frequency. In this paper, we propose a fully integrated CMOS CDA that embodies a novel input-modulated carrier generator and a novel phase-error-free PWM modulator, collectively allowing the employment of high loop-gain to achieve high PSRR, yet without compromising linearity/dynamic-range or resorting to high switching frequency. The prototype CDA, realized in 65 nm CMOS, achieves a THD + N of 0.0027% and a power efficiency of 94% when delivering 500 mW to an 8 Ω load from VDD = 3.6 V. The PSRR of the prototype CDA is very high, -101 dB @217 Hz and 90 dB @1 kHz, arguably the highest to-date. Furthermore, the switching frequency of the prototype CDA varies from ~320 to 420 kHz, potentially reducing the EMI due to spread-spectrum. In addition, the prototype CDA is versatile with a large operating-voltage range, with V ranging from rechargeable 1.2 V single battery to standard 3.6 V smart-device supply voltages.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel CMOS Doherty power amplifier (PA) with an impedance inverter using a variable balun transformer (VBT) and adaptive bias control of an auxiliary amplifier. Unlike a conventional quarter-wavelength (λ/4) transmission line impedance inverter of a Doherty PA, the proposed VBT impedance inverter can achieve load modulation without any phase delay circuit. As a result, a λ/4 phase compensation circuit at the input path of the auxiliary amplifier can be removed, and the total size of the Doherty PA can be reduced. Additionally, an enhancement of the power efficiency at backed-off power levels can successfully be achieved with an adaptive gate bias in a common gate stage of the auxiliary amplifier. The PA, fabricated with 0.13-μm CMOS technology, achieved a 1-dB compression point (P1 dB) of 31.9 dBm and a power-added efficiency (PAE) at P1 dB of 51%. When the PA is tested with 802.11g WLAN orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal of 54 Mb/s, a 25-dB error vector magnitude (EVM) compliant output power of 22.8 dBm and a PAE of 30.1% are obtained, respectively.},

pages={1210-1222}, 
abstract={Analog-to-information converters (AICs) take advantage of the limited information bandwidth in high-frequency signals to improve the energy efficiency of front-end data converters. High-resolution image sensors often convey limited information due to the spatial redundancy between neighboring pixels. This paper proposes a mixed-signal AIC which compresses each nonoverlapping 4 × 4 pixel block in a 816 × 640 pixel prototype active-pixel sensor (APS) imager. It combines an energy-efficient charge-pump bit-image processor (BIP) with an area-efficient successive-approximation-register-single-slope (SAR-SS) hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) via a charge-transfer-amplifier (CTA). The AIC is fully dynamic and consumes no static power. The ADC's capacitor array doubles as a computational device for parts of the compression algorithm which reduces its sampling rate by a factor of four. The compressed data contains direct edge information and can be decoded by a very simple receiver. The fabricated prototype consumes 12 pJ per pixel at 111 fps in the image compression mode and 48 pJ per pixel at 28.7 fps in raw data mode (9 b per pixel) under the same clock rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most energy-efficient compressive CMOS image sensor ever reported in the literature, thanks to the proposed AIC.},

abstract={A 1-0 MASH ΣΔ analog-to-digital converter (ADC) demonstrates a digital linearization technique for the first time treating integrator distortion with memory and capacitor mismatch errors. A two-tap sequential polynomial derived from an output-referred error analysis accurately models the non-ideality of a first-order modulator. The model parameters are extracted by correlating various moments of the ADC digital output with a one-bit pseudorandom noise (PN) superimposed on the input, largely reducing the circuit overhead associated with the nonlinear calibration. The prototype ADC employing amplifiers with a gain of roughly 30 dB measures an 85-dBc spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and a 67-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) for a 1.1- VPP ( -1-dBFS), 4.99-MHz sinusoidal input at 240 MHz sampling clock (8× OSR) with a 7.5-msec calibration time. For a 1.1- VPP two-tone input at 14.9 MHz and 15.1 MHz, the third-order intermodulation product (IM3) after calibration is 87.1 dBc, which is over 30 dB better than that without calibration. The core ADC consumes 37 mW from a 1.25-V supply and occupies 0.28 mm 2 in a 65-nm CMOS low-leakage digital process in which the transistor threshold voltages are around 0.5 V.},

abstract={This paper describes a capacitive touch-screen panel (TSP) readout IC that provides a reconfigurable SNR and frame rate with high noise immunity and touch sensitivity. The readout IC mitigates severe noise interference with a lock-in sensing architecture. In addition, a band-pass filtering effect by the TSP and charge amplifier further improves the noise immunity. A differential sensing scheme is employed to enhance the touch sensitivity and to reject a common-mode noise. A column-parallel incremental ΣΔ ADC is adopted to provide a high resolution and frame rate. Furthermore, a multiple sampling and averaging effect of the ADC enhances the noise immunity. The readout IC reconfigures its SNR and frame rate by adjusting the configurable resolution of the employed ADC. The test chip is fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process and occupies a 2.2 mm 2 active area. The test chip achieves a 60 dB SNR and 200 Hz frame rate with a 12×8 TSP. The SNR can be adjusted from 40 dB to 67 dB, while the frame rate is then inversely scaled from 50 Hz to 6.4 kHz. The test chip supports a supply voltage range from 2.1 V to 3.3 V and consumes 6.26 mW from a 3.3 V supply.},

abstract={A battery-less, multi-node wireless body area network (WBAN) system-on-a-chip (SoC) is demonstrated. An efficiency tracking loop is proposed that adjusts the rectifier's threshold voltage to maximize the wireless harvesting operation, resulting in a minimum RF sensitivity better than -20 dBm at 904.5 MHz. Each SoC node is injection-locked and time-synchronized with the broadcasted RF basestation power (up to a sensitivity of -33 dBm) using an injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD). Hence, every sensor node is phase-locked with the basestation and all nodes can wirelessly transmit TDMA sensor data concurrently. Designed in a 65 nm-CMOS process, the fabricated sensor SoC contains the energy harvesting rectifier and bandgap, duty-cycled ADC, digital logic, as well as the multi-node wireless clock synchronization and MICS-band transmitter. For a broadcasted basestation power of 20 dBm (30 dBm), experimental measurements verify correct powering, sensor reading, and wireless data transfer for a distance of 3 m (9 m). The entire biomedical system application is verified by reception of room and abdominal temperature monitoring.},

title={A 12 bit 200 MS/s Zero-Crossing-Based Pipelined ADC With Early Sub-ADC Decision and Output Residue Background Calibration}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1366-1382}, 
abstract={A 12 bit 200 MS/s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) applies techniques of zero-crossing-based circuits as a replacement for high-gain high-speed op-amps. High accuracy in the residue amplifier is achieved by using a coarse phase in ZCBC followed by a level-shifting capacitor for fine phase. Sub-ADC flash comparators are strobed immediately after the coarse phase to achieve a high sampling rate. The systematic offset voltage between the coarse and fine phase manifests itself as systematic offset in the sub-ADC comparators. This offset is caused by the coarse phase undershoot and the fine phase overshoot. In this work, the offset is cancelled with background calibration by residue range correction circuits in the following stage's sub-ADC. In addition, the sub-ADC's random comparator offset is calibrated with a discrete-time charge-pump based background calibration technique. The reference buffer, bias circuitry, and digital error correction circuits are all integrated on a single chip. The ADC occupies an area of 0.282 mm 2 in 55 nm CMOS technology and dissipates 30.7 mW. It achieves 64.6 dB SNDR and 82.9 dBc SFDR at 200 MS/s for a FOM of 111 fJ/conversion-step. The SNDR degrades gracefully above the designed sampling frequency to 62.9 dB at 250 MS/s, and remains above 50 dB at 300 MS/s.},

abstract={Although closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) promises treatment of many neurological disorders, an implantable system-on-chip (SoC) implementing an effective closed-loop DBS algorithm has not been demonstrated. This work introduces a logarithmic, closed-loop DBS system that detects and processes low-frequency brain field signals to control and adapt stimulation currents. The system records and processes neural signals with four low-noise neural amplifier (LNA) channels, a multiplexed logarithmic ADC, and two high-pass and two low-pass digital logarithmic filters. Logarithmic processing saves power and achieves high dynamic range. A logarithmic domain digital signal processor (DSP) and PI-controller controls eight current stimulator channels and enables closed-loop stimulation. An RF transceiver, a clock generator, and a power harvester are also included in the system to achieve a complete implantable SoC.

abstract={We present a 64-channel cross-correlator system for space-borne synthetic aperture imaging.

The digital ASIC handles 2016 cross-correlations at up to 3.6 GS/s and has a power dissipation of only 0.13 mW/correlation/GHz at a supply voltage of 1 V. The comparator ASIC can handle sample rates of at least 4.5 GS/s with a power dissipation of 47 mW/channel or 1 GS/s with a power dissipation of 17 mW/channel. The assembled system consists of a single board measuring a mere 136 × 136 mm2 and weighing only 135 g. The assembled system demonstrates crosstalk of 0.04% between neighboring channels and stability of 800 s.

abstract={To address the cost and universality of ultra-low-power (ULP) radios for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, a sub-GHz multi-ISM-band (433/860/915/960 MHz) ZigBee receiver is developed. It features a gain-boosted N-path switched-capacitor (SC) network embedded into a function-reuse RF front-end, offering concurrent RF (common-mode) and BB (differential-mode) amplification, LO-defined RF filtering, and input impedance matching with zero external components. Interestingly, not only the BB power and area are nullified, but also the loading effect between the RF and BB blocks is averted, resulting in better noise figure (NF). Unlike the existing N-path filtering, the described gain-boosted topology offers: 1) double RF filtering at both input and output of the RF front-end; 2) size reduction of the physical capacitors thanks to the Miller multiplication effect, and 3) LO-power saving by decoupling the mixer's on-resistance to the ultimate stopband rejection. Together with a low-voltage LC-VCO with extensively-distributed negative-gain cells for current-reuse with the BB filters, the receiver achieves 8.1 ± 0.6 dB NF, 50 ± 2 dB gain and -20.5 ± 1.5 dBm out-of-band IIP3 at 1.15 ± 0.05 mW power at 0.5 V over the four ISM bands.

abstract={A 32-Gb ReRAM test chip has been developed in a 24-nm process, with a diode as the selection device and metal oxide as the switching element. The memory array is constructed with cross-point architecture to allow multiple memory layers stacked above the supporting circuitry and minimize the circuit area overhead. Die efficiency is further improved by sharing wordlines and bitlines between adjacent blocks. As the number of sense amplifiers under the memory array is limited, a pipelined array control scheme is adopted to compensate the performance impact while utilizing the fast switching time of ReRAM cells. With the chip current consumption being dominated by the array leakage and sensitive to array bias and operating conditions, a charge pump stage control scheme is introduced to dynamically adapt to the operating conditions for optimal power consumption. Smart Read during sensing and leakage current compensation scheme during programming are applied to the large-block architecture and achieve a chip density that is several orders of magnitude higher than prior ReRAM developments.},

abstract={This paper presents a clockless digital filter able to process inputs of different rates and formats, synchronous or asynchronous, with no adjustment needed to handle each input type. The filter is designed using a mix of asynchronous and real-time digital hardware, and for this reason relies on neither a clock nor the input data rate for setting its frequency response. The modular architecture of the filter, including delay segments with separated data and timing paths and a pipelined multi-way adder, allows easy extensions for different data widths. The filter was used as part of an ADC/DSP/DAC system which maintains its frequency response intact for varying sample rates without requiring any internal change. This property is not possible for any synchronous DSP system. The 16-tap, 8-bit FIR filter, integrated in a 130 nm CMOS process, includes on-chip automatic delay tuning, and for certain inputs, has signal-to-error ratio which exceeds that of clocked systems.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully autonomous integrated circuit (IC) dedicated to piezoelectric harvesters. The novel Multi-Shot Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (MS-SECE) performed by the IC optimizes the energy transfer from a highly charged piezoelectric harvester to a low voltage storage element. The system deals with piezoelectric powers in the 10 μW to 1 mW range and handles very high piezoelectric voltage values ( >100 V) thanks to the off-chip components around the IC. The IC has been fabricated in AMS 0.35 μm 3.3 V technology and its low power consumption (1 μW @ 5 Hz) is particularly suitable for low frequency harvesters. MS-SECE increases the extracted power compared to the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique but it also improves the efficiency by up to 25% compared to standard SECE. Furthermore, MS-SECE allows the use of small off-chip components: an efficiency of 61% has been reached with a 125 mm 3 coupled-inductor. Finally, the proposed power management circuit self-starts, works without any battery and its overall volume is expected to be less than 1 cm 3 .},

abstract={A reference-less half-rate digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit employing a phase-rotating phase-locked loop (PRPLL) as phase interpolator is presented. By implementing the proportional control in phase domain within the PRPLL, the proposed CDR decouples jitter transfer (JTRAN) bandwidth from jitter tolerance (JTOL) corner frequency, eliminates jitter peaking, and removes JTRAN dependence on bang-bang phase detector gain. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype CDR achieves error-free operation (BER <; 10-12) with PRBS data sequences ranging from PRBS7 to PRBS31. At 5 Gb/s, it consumes 13.1 mW power and achieves a recovered clock long-term jitter of 5.0 ps rms/44.0 ps pp when operating with PRBS31 input data. The measured JTRAN bandwidth is 2 MHz and JTOL corner frequency is 16 MHz. The CDR is tolerant to 110 mV pp of sinusoidal noise on the DCO supply voltage at the worst case noise frequency of 7 MHz. At 2.5 GHz, the PRPLL consumes 2.9 mW and achieves -134 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1 MHz frequency offset. The differential and integral non-linearity of its digital-to-phase transfer characteristic are within ±0.2 LSB and ±0.4 LSB, respectively.},

abstract={This paper proposes a vision chip hybrid architecture with dynamically reconfigurable processing element (PE) array processor and self-organizing map (SOM) neural network. It integrates a high speed CMOS image sensor, three von Neumann-type processors, and a non-von Neumann-type bio-inspired SOM neural network. The processors consist of a pixel-parallel PE array processor with O(N×N) parallelism, a row-parallel row-processor (RP) array processor with O(N) parallelism and a thread-parallel dual-core microprocessor unit (MPU) with O(2) parallelism. They execute low-, mid- and high-level image processing, respectively. The SOM network speeds up high-level processing in pattern recognition tasks by O(N/4×N/4), which improves the chip performance remarkably. The SOM network can be dynamically reconfigured from the PE array to largely save chip area. A prototype chip with a 256 × 256 image sensor, a reconfigurable 64 × 64 PE array processor/16 × 16 SOM network, a 64 × 1 RP array processor and a dual-core 32-bit MPU was implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS image sensor process. The chip can perform image capture and various-level image processing at a high speed and in flexible fashion. Various complicated applications including M-S functional solution, horizon estimation, hand gesture recognition, face recognition are demonstrated at high speed from several hundreds to >1000 fps.},

abstract={The design of resistive RAM (ReRAM) faces two major challenges: 1) cell area versus write current requirements and 2) cell read current (ICELL) versus read disturbance. This paper proposes ReRAM macros using logic-process-based vertical parasitic-BJT (VPBJT) switches and a corresponding cell array (VPBJT-CA), resulting in a 4.5× macro density compared to conventional NMOS-switch ReRAM for given write current requirements. To overcome temperature-dependent fluctuations in the base-emitter voltage difference (VBE) of VPBJT, we propose a temperature-aware bitline (BL) voltage bias (VBL-R) (TABB) scheme to provide current-mode sensing with 4.7× larger ICELL and 1.6× faster read speeds. Test results of fabricated 0.18 μm 1 Mb and 65 nm 2 Mb VPBJT ReRAM macros confirm the efficacy of the temperature-aware VBL-R, resulting in sub-5-ns random read access times.},

abstract={To address the two main challenges concerning the design of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), namely, improving the sensitivity of the TIA without sacrificing bandwidth and suppressing inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to insertion loss, a 25 Gb/s optical receiver (RX) based on 65 nm CMOS technology, including a TIA and a PD operating at 1.3 μm wavelength, was developed. The key components of the TIA are a two-stage offset-cancelation scheme and a low-voltage output driver with peaking gain of 7.7 dB at 12.5 GHz. This driver performance is achieved by separating the equalizer function and output buffer of the driver. The TIA attains a sensitivity of -9.7 dBm (86- μApp) OMA and an eye opening of 65% at data rate of 25 Gb/s. The optical RX operates at 28 Gb/s with sensitivity of -8.2 dBm (121- μApp) OMA. Utilizing the CMOS TIA, an implemented VCSEL-based optical link operating at 850 nm wavelength achieves sensitivity of -7.3 dBm (98- μApp) OMA.

A multilevel (two-bit) nonreturn-to-zero DAC improves jitter immunity to enable a high dynamic range, and, with a class-AB low-noise transconductance amplifier, guarantees a highly linear front end. For a 4 MHz signal, the peak SNDR of the receiver exceeds 68 dB and is better than 60 dB across the 400 MHz to 4 GHz carrier frequency range.

pages={950-960}, 
abstract={This paper presents a digital background calibration technique to realize a linear voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) based ADC. The distortion caused due to the VCO's nonlinear tuning characteristics is eliminated by introducing an inverse voltage-to-frequency transfer function in the signal path. The proposed calibration unit runs in the background and detects the inverse transfer function using a highly digital frequency locked loop. Like many other VCO-based ADCs, the proposed technique does not require analog building blocks such as operational amplifiers, multi-bit feed-back DACs etc., and retains the scaling friendly properties. Implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process, the on-chip calibration improves SNDR of an open-loop VCO-based ADC from 46 dB to more than 73 dB in 5 MHz signal bandwidth while consuming 4.1 mW power. The ADC achieves a figure-of-merit of 91-112 fJ/conv-step for different input frequencies.},

abstract={A half-duplex serial link design that is capable of 22 Gbps operation over PCB channels with up to 20 dB of loss is presented. A current-mode transmitter can be configured either as a pre-cursor or post-cursor 2-tap FIR filter. The receiver consists of a trans-admittance-trans-impedance single-stage linear equalizer that can provide 10 dB of high-frequency gain without the use of peaking inductors. The CTLE is followed by an half-rate 2-tap decision feedback equalizer with direct feedback. To mitigate long-tail intersymbol interference in a power-efficient manner, a third DFE tap employs a single-pole IIR filter. A 15-22 GHz LC-PLL provides quadrature clocks to a 16-lane macro. The 16-lane macro occupies 1.66 mm × 1.6 mm in a 28 nm CMOS process and is packaged in a 45 mm × 45 mm flip-chip MCM module.

pages={2658-2672}, 
abstract={A Weighted Current Feedback (WCF) technique for output capacitorless low-dropout (OCL-LDO) regulator is presented in this paper. Through feedback of a weighted current, the WCF permits smart management of the output impedance as well as the gain from the inter-gain stage. Based on the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, the WCF can avoid the right-half plane (RHP) pole and push the left-half plane (LHP) non-dominant complex pole pair to a higher frequency. Besides, it provides good regulator loop gain and fast transient response. Validated by UMC 65 nm CMOS process, the simulation and measurement results have shown that the WCF LDO regulator can operate at a load capacitance (CL) range from 470 pF to 10 nF with only 3.8 pF compensation capacitor. At a supply of 0.75 V and a quiescent current of 15.9 μA, the proposed circuit can support a maximum load current (IL) of 50 mA. When IL switches from 0 to 50 mA in 100 ns, the output can settle within 400 ns for the whole CL range. For a case of single capacitor (CL 470 pF), the settling time is only 250 ns. The comparison results have shown that the WCF LDO regulator offers a comparable or better transient figure-of-merit (FOM) and additional merit to drive wide load capacitance range.},

To improve the sampling linearity and RF sampling performance, the ADC employs input distortion cancellation and a digital background calibration technique to compensate for the non-linear charge injection (kick-back) from the sampling capacitors on the input driver. In addition, an effective dithering technique is embedded in the calibration signal to break the dependence of the calibration's convergence on the input signal amplitude.

abstract={An accelerometer for electronic stability control utilizes a two-mass mechanical sensor element to implement a fully-differential signal path, achieving robustness against electromagnetic interference (EMI) without the need for external shielding in the package. The EMI rejection is augmented further with a pseudo-random chopping scheme, which spreads the interference over a wide bandwidth, reducing its in-band portion to the level of the noise floor. The chopping function maintains zero-mean voltage waveforms across the sensor electrodes, which is also beneficial for the long-term offset stability of the device. A charge-balanced capacitance-to-voltage converter provides linear transduction for displacements of the proof-mass up to 70% of the gap and minimizes the residual electrostatic forces. A dual-axis design occupies 1.1 mm 2 in 0.18- μm CMOS and consumes 820 μA from an internally regulated 1.9-V supply. The system achieves 380 μg/ √Hz noise floor and 84-dB dynamic range.

abstract={This paper details the design of an 8-lane bidirectional link for both within-the-box and external communications in 22 nm CMOS technology. A low profile connector with a high density cable assembly ensure a data rate of up to 32 Gb/s per lane while maintaining channel loss below 25 dB. Channel equalization is performed by a combination of a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), single-stage continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a 6-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Collaborative timing recovery is used to enable lane characterization without degrading jitter performance. Phase error decimation, with a conditional phase detection scheme, is used to reduce the DFE complexity by 50%. Power consumption over a wide range of data rates from 4 to 32 Gb/s is reduced by using regulated CMOS clocking with lane bundling, low swing transmitter with a source-series terminated (SST) driver and a highly reconfigurable receiver with an active inductor CTLE. At a lane data rate of 32 Gb/s, over a 0.5 m cable with 16 dB of loss, a transceiver lane consumes 205 mW from a 1.07 V supply. The power scales down to 26 mW from a 0.72 V supply at 8 Gb/s, when transmitting over a channel with 8 dB loss. The active silicon area per lane is 0.079 mm2.},

title={Cancellation of OpAmp Virtual Ground Imperfections by a Negative Conductance Applied to Improve RF Receiver Linearity}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1112-1124}, 
abstract={High linearity CMOS radio receivers often exploit linear V-I conversion at RF, followed by passive down-mixing and an OpAmp-based Transimpedance Amplifier at baseband. Due to nonlinearity and finite gain in the OpAmp, virtual ground is imperfect, inducing distortion currents. This paper proposes a negative conductance concept to cancel such distortion currents. Through a simple intuitive analysis, the basic operation of the technique is explained. By mathematical analysis the optimum negative conductance value is derived and related to feedback theory. In- and out-of-band linearity, stability and Noise Figure are also analyzed. The technique is applied to linearize an RF receiver, and a prototype is implemented in 65 nm technology. Measurement results show an increase of in-band IIP 3 from 9 dBm to >20 dBm, and IIP2 from 51 to 61 dBm, at the cost of increasing the noise figure from 6 to 7.5 dB and <;10% power penalty.

abstract={This work reports a fully parallel match-line (ML) structure with an automated background checking (ABC) scheme. MLs are pre-charged to an intermediate level by a pulsed current source to minimize power. The proposed ABC scheme uses two dummy rows for digitally adjusting the pulse width and the delay of the sense amplifier enable signals of the CAM without disturbing the normal operation. Therefore, it can continuously track the optimum ML swing, making the CAM tolerant to variations. The proposed ABC scheme achieves the power reduction of 5.5× compared with the conventional ML sensing scheme. In addition, multi-V t transistors are used in the CAM cell to reduce the leakage by 15× while improving the ML discharging speed by 2× when compared with the standard-V t devices at 1.2 V, 80 °C. A test chip was prototyped using a standard 65 nm CMOS process. The average energy consumption is 0.77 fJ/bit/search at 1.2 V/500 MHz.},

abstract={This paper presents a single loop, third order continuous time ΔΣ modulator with an internal 4 bit quantizer sampled at 500 MHz with only an oversampling ratio of 10. Since multi-bit operation commonly suffers from DAC non-linearities, and dynamic element matching is ineffective at low oversampling, an alternative auxiliary DAC linearization is proposed for ΔΣ modulators. The unit element mismatches are digitally estimated based on a cross correlation of a binary test signal with the modulator output and represent the measured DNL of DAC1. The corresponding INL is calculated and stored in an 15×8 lookup-table which is applied to the 8 bit auxiliary DAC to linearize DAC1. Moreover, a design centering approach for amplifier finite gain bandwidth compensation within the loop filter is presented which allows for large bandwidth mismatch with negligible effect on loop filter stability. This results in a robust architecture over temperature, supply, and excess loop delay variations. The presented ΔΣ modulator achieves an SNDR of 67.5 dB, DR of 72 dB, and SFDR of 79 dB over a 25 MHz bandwidth and is implemented in a 1.2 V, 90 nm CMOS process. The modulator occupies an active area of 0.19 mm2 and has a power consumption of 8.5 mW. It achieves a figure of merit of 88 fJ/conv-step which is one of the best published for multi-bit ΔΣ modulators.},

abstract={Design equations and performance limits of Class-E power amplifiers at mm-waves, including the limitations imposed by active and passive devices in a given technology, are presented in this paper. A beyond nominal breakdown voltage Class-E design methodology for SiGe HBT power amplifiers is proposed to generate high output power while maintaining high Class-E efficiency. A mm-wave SiGe stacked Class-E architecture is also introduced to increase the overall voltage swing, with each series stacked device operating in the beyond nominal breakdown mode. The mm-wave beyond BVCEO operation of SiGe HBTs has been demonstrated experimentally in an integrated 45 GHz Class-E power amplifier fabricated in a 0.13 μm SiGe BiCMOS process with 20 dBm measured output power at 31.5% peak power-added efficiency (PAE). The series stacking of mm-wave Class-E power amplifier concept is also verified by fabricating double-stacked and triple-stacked SiGe HBT power amplifiers in 0.13 μm SiGe BiCMOS process which demonstrate a measured output power of 23.4 dBm at 41 GHz with peak PAE of 34.9%.

The proposed highly digital architecture and supply voltage scaling lead to a 3x improvement in RX energy efficiency and minimize silicon area consumption (~ 0.35 mm2 in 65 nm CMOS) while achieving state-of-the-art sensitivity. While this implementation focuses on WBAN demodulation, the proposed architecture and circuit techniques are generally applicable to RX targeting ultra-low power consumption for sensor networks.},

abstract={Emerging wireless standards specify dozens of bands spanning several octaves, which need to be supported in form-factor and energy constrained mobile devices targeting ubiquitous connectivity. However, in current multi-band radio implementations, significant redundancy is still the norm in the RF frontend. This work introduces an improved architecture for multi-band, time-division duplexed (TDD) radios, which replaces multiple narrowband frontend components with a frequency-agile solution, tunable over a wide frequency range. A highly digital architecture is adopted, leading to a fully integrated solution wherein both efficiency and achievable frequency range benefit from CMOS scaling. A prototype is integrated in 45 nm SOI CMOS. Peak PA output power is 27.7 ±0.5 dBm from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz, with up to 30% total efficiency at 2 V. For TDD LTE applications, better than -30 dBc ACLR and -30 dB EVM is measured with 64 QAM, 20 MHz signals from 1.44 to 3.41 GHz, with up to 17.2% average efficiency and 23.4 dBm average power. The LNA achieves AV ≥ 14 dB, NF = 4.4 ±1.6 dB and IIP 3 ≥ -7 dBm from 1.3 to 3.3 GHz while drawing just 6 mA from 1 V. The demonstrated frequency range covers a total of 11 TDD bands .},

abstract={This paper presents a 210-GHz transceiver with OOK modulation in a 32-nm SOI CMOS process (fT/fmax= 250/320 GHz). The transmitter (TX) employs a 2 × 2 spatial combining array consisting of a double-stacked cross-coupled voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) at 210 GHz with an on-off-keying (OOK) modulator, a power amplifier (PA) driver, a novel balun-based differential power distribution network, four PAs, and an on-chip 2 × 2 dipole antenna array. The noncoherent receiver (RX) utilizes a direct detection architecture consisting of an on-chip antenna, a low-noise amplifier (LNA), and a power detector. The VCO generates measured -13.5-dBm output power, and the PA shows a measured 15-dB gain and 4.6-dBm Psat. The LNA exhibits a measured in-band gain of 18 dB and minimum in-band noise figure (NF) of 11 dB. The TX achieves an EIRP of 5.13 dBm at 10 dB back-off from saturated power. It achieves an estimated EIRP of 15.2 dBm when the PAs are fully driven. This is the first demonstration of a fundamental frequency CMOS transceiver at the 200-GHz frequency range.},

abstract={A mm-wave I-Q power-DAC is reported at W-band. The circuit, which is fabricated in a 45 nm SOI CMOS technology, employs a series-stacked Gilbert-cell output stage with gate finger geometry segmentation to directly modulate a 85-95 GHz carrier. The Gilbert-cell provides phase inversion and 7 bits for ASK envelope modulation, each of which can be switched at speeds up to 15 Gb/s. A ninth bit turns the entire DAC cell on and off at 15 Gb/s, as needed to create an arbitrary 15 Gbaud QAM constellation in a symmetrical 4×4 I-Q power-DAC transmitter array, with free-space power combining and antenna-level segmentation. The measured output power and PAE of the I or Q DAC cells are 19 dBm and 8.9%, respectively. Three effective bits of amplitude resolution and one phase bit are estimated from the small-signal S-parameter measurements in the 80-95 GHz range. The envelope amplitude resolution reduces to only two effective bits under saturated output power operation. The OOK bit provides over 45 dB of measured attenuation and dynamic range, relative to the peak output power.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49},

pages={1861-1871}, 
abstract={Embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) is considered to be a critical building block in future system-on-chip and microprocessor systems. Various eNVM technologies have been explored for high-density applications including dual-poly embedded flash (eflash), FeRAM, STT-MRAM, and RRAM. On the other end of the spectrum, logic-compatible eNVM such as e-fuse, anti-fuse, and single-poly eflash memories have been considered for moderate-density low-cost applications. In particular, single-poly eflash memory has been gaining momentum as it can be implemented in a generic logic process while supporting multiple program-erase cycles. One key challenge for single-poly eflash is enabling bit-by-bit re-write operation without a boosted bitline voltage as this could cause disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. In this work, we present details of a bit-by-bit re-writable eflash memory implemented in a generic 65 nm logic process which addresses this key challenge. The proposed 6 T eflash memory cell can improve the overall cell endurance by eliminating redundant program/erase cycles while preventing disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. We also provide details of special high voltage circuits such as a voltage-doubler based charge pump circuit and a multistory high-voltage switch, for generating a reliable high-voltage output without causing damage to the standard logic transistors.},

year={2014},

pages={289-300}, 
abstract={We report a low-power object-adaptive CMOS imager, which suppresses spatial temporal bandwidth. The object-adaptive imager has embedded a feature extraction algorithm for identifying objects of interest. The sensor wakes up triggered by motion sensing and extracts features from the captured image for the detection of object-of-interest (OOI). Full-image capturing operation and image signal transmission are performed only when the interested objects are found, which significantly reduces power consumption at the sensor node. This motion-triggered OOI imaging significantly saves a spatial bandwidth more than 96.5% from the feature output and saves a temporal bandwidth from the motion-triggered wakeup and object adaptive imaging. The sensor consumes low power by employing a reconfigurable differential-pixel architecture with reduced power supply voltage and by implementing the feature extraction algorithm with mixed-signal circuitry in a small area. The chip operates at 0.22 μW/frame in motion-sensing mode and at 3.4 μW/frame for feature extraction, respectively. The object detection from on-chip feature extraction circuits has demonstrated a 94.5% detection rate for human from a set of 200 sample images.},

abstract={A 0.25 cm3 autonomous energy harvesting micro-platform is realized to efficiently scavenge, rectify and store ambient vibration energy with batteryless cold start-up and zero sleep-mode power consumption. The fabricated compact system integrates a high-performance vacuum-packaged piezoelectric MEMS energy harvester with a power management IC and surface-mount components including an ultra-capacitor. The power management circuit incorporates a rectification stage with ~30 mV voltage drop, a bias-Ωip stage with a novel control system for increased harvesting efficiency, a trickle charger for permanent storage of harvested energy, and a low power supply-independent bias circuitry. The overall system weighs less than 0.6 grams, does not require a precharged battery, and has power consumption of 0.5 μW in active-mode and 10 pW in sleep-mode operation. While excited with 1 g vibration, the platform is tested to charge an initially depleted 70 mF ultra-capacitor to 1.85 V in 50 minutes (at 155 Hz vibration), and a 20 mF ultra-capacitor to 1.35 V in 7.5 min (at 419 Hz). The end-to-end rectification efficiency from the harvester to the ultra-capacitor is measured as 58-86%. The system can harvest from a minimum vibration level of 0.1 g.},

abstract={This paper describes an energy-efficient SAR ADC for ultra-low power applications. The asynchronous 2 b/step scheme halves both conversion time and DAC/digital circuit's switching activities and hence likewise reduces static and dynamic energy consumption. A low-power sleep mode is engaged at the end of each clock period. The technical contributions of this work include: 1) an innovative 2 b/step reference scheme based on a hybrid R-2R/C-3C DAC to minimize DAC hardware, 2) an interpolation-assisted time-domain 2 b comparison scheme that saves 33% in comparator circuitry, and 3) a dual-edge-comparison mechanism that reduces the time-domain comparator's (TDC) switching activities by 50%. All these techniques help reduce circuit overhead and overall energy consumption. The prototype ADC was fabricated in 180 nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.103 mm 2 . With a single 0.6 V supply and reference, the ADC achieves an ENoB of 9.2 bits and a FoM of 6.7 fJ/conversion-step while sampling at 100-kS/s.},

year={2014},

pages={2673-2683}, 
abstract={Mobile devices need to minimize their power consumption in order to maximize battery runtime, except during short extremely busy periods. This requirement makes dc-dc converters usually operate in standby mode or under light-load conditions. Therefore, implementation of an efficient regulation scheme under a light load is a key aspect of dc-dc converter design. This paper presents a multiphase buck converter with a rotating phase-shedding scheme for efficient light-load control. The converter includes four phases operating in an interleaved manner in order to supply high current with low output ripple. The multiphase converter implements a rotating phase-shedding scheme to distribute the switching activity concentrated on a single phase, resulting in a distribution of the aging effects among the phases instead of a single phase. The proposed multiphase buck converter was fabricated using a 0.18 μm bipolar CMOS DMOS process. The supply voltage ranges from 2.7 V to 5 V, and the maximum allowable output current is 4.5 A.},

One is a programmable gain element that adjusts the opamp gain and nonlinearity error, and the other is a digitally implemented oversampling quantizer that detects the error polarity with high precision. The total opamp-induced error is removed using an opamp input error monitoring algorithm, which also eliminates the opamp noise and offset. The proposed nonlinearity-cancelled bottom-plate sampling helps to realize accurate inter-stage residue transfer and to alleviate the stringent requirement in the design of high-gain wideband opamps.

title={Background Adaptive Cancellation of Digital Switching Noise in a Pipelined Analog-to-Digital Converter Without Noise Sensors}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1397-1407}, 
abstract={Switching noise generated by digital circuits can degrade analog circuit performance in mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs). In an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), one major source of switching noise is digital output drivers. Traditional methods for mitigating this problem mostly have been to isolate the analog and digital circuits to minimize digital noise coupling into sensitive analog nodes. This paper presents two fully digital and adaptive algorithms, which find and cancel errors due to switching noise coupling at the output of an ADC without using noise sensors. To demonstrate the operation of these algorithms, a 12-bit, 40-MS/s pipelined ADC has been designed and fabricated in 0.18-μm CMOS process. The system consists of an ADC with its own output drivers, and eight other independent digital output drivers (noise buffers) that can be programmed to produce four different kinds of switching noise. The switching noise cancellation (SNC) algorithm estimates noise parameters and stores them in look-up tables. At the ADC output, the effects of switching noise are digitally removed to recover the input samples. Test results show that the ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) of 64.9 dB with all of the noise-generating buffers off. With the noise buffers on, the worst case SNDR before and after SNC is 51.9 dB and 63.7 dB, respectively.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={3}, 
pages={622-634}, 
abstract={In this paper, a design method for the co-design and integration of a CMOS rectifier and small loop antenna is described. In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification. The chip is ESD protected and integrated on a compact loop antenna.

abstract={This paper reports on design and development of a reliable, single-chip, multichannel wireless biotelemetry microsystem intended for extracellular neural recording from awake, and behaving small animal models. The system requirements for reliable neural recording are identified and the inherently conflicting requirements of low power and reliability are addressed at architectural and circuit levels. The 2.85 × 3.84 mm2, mixed-signal ASIC is fabricated in a 0.5 μm 2P3M n-well standard CMOS process; and integrates a low-noise front-end, programmable digital controller, an RF modulator, and an RF power amplifier at the ISM band of 433 MHz on a single-chip. The microsystem, incorporating the ASIC, features 9-channel, is programmable, weighs 2.2 g (including batteries) and has dimensions of 2.2 × 1.1 × 0.5 cm3. The transmitter consumes 5 mW and has a measured input referred voltage noise of 4.58 μV rms, 6.20 μV rms, and 7.81 μV rms at transmission distances of 3 m, 10 m, and 20 m, respectively. The measured inter-channel crosstalk is less than 3.5% and battery life is about an hour. The presented biotelemetry system has been successfully used in two in-vivo neural recording experiments: i) from the antennas of a freely roaming South-American cockroach, and ii) from the hippocampus of an awake and mobile rat.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1580-1594}, 
abstract={The continuous built-in resistance detection (CBIRD) is proposed in the switching-based charger system to achieve fast charging. Corresponding to built-in resistance (BIR) variation of Li-ion battery and charging current limitation from input energy, the CBIRD dynamically adjusts the transition voltage at the constant current (CC) mode. As a result, the transition timing from CC mode to the constant voltage (CV) mode can be postponed. Rated large charging current and extended period in CC mode effectively reduce charging time. Besides, the proposed automatic energy deliver control (AEDC) technique considers both loading system and battery status simultaneously to manage charging current according to the loading system's requirement and input supply energy for high efficiency charging. The proposed switching-based charger system was fabricated in 0.25 μm CMOS process and occupied 3 mm2 silicon area. The charger system can save up to 40% of charging time. The charger system achieves 87% of peak power efficiency at a rated 1 A charging current.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2054-2066}, 
abstract={This paper presents Razor-Lite, which is a low-overhead register for use in error detection and correction (EDAC) systems. These systems are able to eliminate timing margins by using specialized registers to detect setup time violations. However, these EDAC registers incur significant area and energy overheads, which mitigates some the system benefits. Razor-Lite is a new EDAC register that addresses this issue by adding only 8 additional transistors to a conventional flip-flop design. The Razor-Lite flip-flop achieves low overhead via a charge-sharing technique that attaches to a standard flip-flop without modifying its design. Side-channels connected to the floating nodes generate error flags through simple logic gates totaling 8 transistors, enabling register energy/area overheads of 2.7%/33% over a conventional DFF, while also not incurring extra clock or datapath loading or delay. Razor-Lite is demonstrated in a 7-stage Alpha architecture processor in a 45nm SOI CMOS technology with a measured energy improvement of 83% while incurring a 4.4% core area overhead compared to a baseline design.},

abstract={A 16 Gb/s I/O link receiver fabricated in 22 nm CMOS SOI technology is presented. Attenuation and ISI of transmitted NRZ data across PCB channels are equalized with a CTLE feeding an 8-tap DFE. The first tap uses digital speculation and the following seven taps are realized by means of the switched-capacitor technique. Timing recovery and control are performed with a Mueller-Müller type-A baud-rate CDR. The architecture is half-rate and requires one phase rotator. In total, each slice has six comparators to recover data and timing information. The secondorder digital CDR operates at quarter-rate and features a low-latency implementation of the proportional path. At 16 Gb/s, 1 Vppd PRBS31 data transmitted without FFE equalization is recovered across a PCB channel with 34 dB attenuation at 8 GHz. The measured tracking bandwidth is 31 kppm (16 GHz ± 496 MHz), and an amplitude of 3 UIPP is tolerated at 1 MHz sinusoidal jitter. The sinusoidal jitter amplitude tolerance measured at 10 Gb/s is 0.4 UIPP at 10 MHz and remains above 0.2 UIPP up to 1 GHz with PRBS31 data recovered (BER <; 10-12) across a PCB channel with 27 dB attenuation at 5 GHz. The power efficiency is 3.7 mW/Gb/s, including the full-rate clock receiver.},

abstract={Embedded SRAMs are continuing to be one of the most critical components that limit the performance and energy budget of today's systems. To enable better system level optimization, this paper introduces an embedded energy monitoring circuit that measures the absolute energy consumption of a 128 kbit SRAM circuit that is fabricated using a 65 nm low-power CMOS process. Monitoring circuit results are measured to be accurate within 10% of the actual energy consumption and it works with minimal overhead (below 1% active power). Secondly, to achieve energy-efficient and high-performance SRAM operation, various circuit techniques are employed. 8T bit-cells with word-line voltage boosting is used to enable operation for a wide supply range from 370 mV to 1.2 V. Since variation effects are more prominent at low-voltages, SRAM performance is improved by using a two stage sensing scheme. Global sensing is performed by offset compensated sense amplifiers that leverage body biasing to achieve up to 2x offset reduction for only 3.5% area overhead compared to SRAM area.},

volume={49},

pages={2342-2351}, 
abstract={Machine vision requires CMOS image sensors (CISs) with high frame rate, short exposure time, and fine spatial resolution. Recently, capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) is used in the high-speed pixel circuit to achieve high sensitivity by expediting the charge transfer from the photodiode to a tiny integration capacitor ( CINT). Existing CTIA pixel designs have large pixel sizes due to the multiple sampling capacitors and switches for global shutter and CDS, which unfavorably limits the spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a 400 fps CIS design with 640 × 480 pixel array for machine vision. With simplified pixel circuits, the new sensor has a CTIA pixel size of 8.7 × 8.22 μm2, which is the smallest in the category. The pixel implements a new multi-layer MOM capacitor with good uniformity as the tiny CINT, which achieves high sensitivity (36.5 V/lux·s) without calibration. Pixel-wise CDS is implemented in this global-shutter CIS to minimize the pixel noise. The pixel signals are quantized by 640 column processing slices with 12 bit resolution at 411 kS/s. The size of the column SAR ADC is minimized with a simple calibration technique. The CIS is fabricated in a 0.18 μm mixed-signal CMOS process. The temporal noise is 15.6 erms-. With the new MOM capacitor, FPN of the CIS is 0.55% without calibration. The new pixel design achieves the highest sensitivity per unit area.},

abstract={We present a 2nd-generation system for high-resolution structural-health monitoring of bridges and buildings. The system combines large-area electronics (LAE) and CMOS ICs via scalable interfaces based on inductive and capacitive coupling. This enables architectures where the functional strengths of both technologies can be leveraged to enable large-scale strain sensing scalable to cm resolution yet over large-area sheets. The system consists of three subsystems: (1) a power-management subsystem, where LAE is leveraged for solar-power harvesting, and CMOS is leveraged for power conversion and regulation; (2) a sensing subsystem, where LAE is leveraged for dense strain sensing, and CMOS is leveraged for multi-sensor acquisition; and (3) a communication subsystem, where LAE is leveraged for long-range interconnects, and CMOS is leveraged for low-power transceivers. The power-management subsystem achieves 30% efficiency for DC-AC power inversion and inductive power delivery to the CMOS IC and 80.5% overall efficiency for generating three voltages via DC-DC converters. The sensing subsystem has a readout noise level of 23 μStrainRMS (141 μStrainRMS including sensor noise), at an energy/meas. of 148 nJ and 286 nJ for readout and sensor-accessing control, respectively.

Newly proposed self-oscillating switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC voltage doublers are cascaded to form a complete harvester, with configurable overall conversion ratio from 9× to 23×. In each voltage doubler, the oscillator is completely internalized within the SC network, eliminating clock generation and level shifting power overheads. A single doubler has >70% measured efficiency across 1 nA to 0.35 mA output current ( >10 5 range) with low idle power consumption of 170 pW. In the harvester, each doubler has independent frequency modulation to maintain its optimum conversion efficiency, enabling optimization of harvester overall conversion efficiency. A leakage-based delay element provides energy-efficient frequency control over a wide range, enabling low idle power consumption and a wide load range with optimum conversion efficiency. The harvester delivers 5 nW-5 μW output power with >40% efficiency and has an idle power consumption 3 nW, in test chip fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS technology.},

abstract={An 8 × 16 pixel array based on CMOS small-area silicon photomultipliers (mini-SiPMs) detectors for PET applications is reported. Each pixel is 570 × 610 μm2 in size and contains four digital mini-SiPMs, for a total of 720 SPADs, resulting in a full chip fill-factor of 35.7%. For each gamma detection, the pixel provides the total detected energy and a timestamp, obtained through two 7-b counters and two 12-b 64-ps TDCs. An adder tree overlaid on top of the pixel array sums the sensor total counts at up to 100 Msamples/s, which are then used for detecting the asynchronous gamma events on-chip, while also being output in real-time. Characterization of gamma detection performance with an 3 × 3 × 5 mm3 LYSO scintillator at 20°C is reported, showing a 511-keV gamma energy resolution of 10.9% and a coincidence timing resolution of 399 ps.},

abstract={A 10/30 MHz voltage-mode controlled buck converter with a wide duty-cycle range is presented. A high-accuracy delay-compensated ramp generator using only low-speed comparators but can work up to 70 MHz is proposed. By using a differential difference amplifier (DDA), a new Type-III compensator is proposed to reduce the chip area of the compensator by 60%. Moreover, based on the unique structure of the proposed compensator, an end-point prediction (EPP) scheme is also implemented to achieve fast reference-tracking responses. The converter was fabricated in a 0.13 μm standard CMOS process. It achieves wide duty-cycle ranges of 0.75 and 0.59 when switching at 10 MHz and 30 MHz with peak efficiencies of 91.8% and 86.6%, respectively. The measured maximum output power is 3.6 W with 2.4 V output voltage and 1.5 A load current. With a constant load current of 500 mA, the up-tracking speeds for switching frequencies of 10 MHz and 30 MHz are 1.67 μs/V and 0.67 μs/V, respectively. The down-tracking speeds for 10 MHz and 30 MHz are 4.44 μs/V and 1.56 μs/V, respectively.},

abstract={A frequency-folded ADC-based broadband sampling receiver that merges sampling within the structure of a broadband downconverter is presented. The receiver channelizes a broadband input into sub-bands after digitization, while employing digital-domain harmonic and image rejection. The design offers a frequency-domain approach to simultaneously achieving high sample rate and dynamic range per-unit power consumption. Noise and distortion performance of the architecture is described. An analysis of SNR improvement during signal reconstruction that results from the use of multiple paths at baseband is presented. A 2 GS/s receiver based on this approach is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. The receiver spans a bandwidth from 125 MHz to 1000 MHz, and achieves a mean SNDR of 49 dB across the input bandwidth, while providing 38-43.3 dB of gain and a NF of 8.5-13.4 dB. Equalization-based calibration results in harmonic and image rejection greater than 59 dB and 58 dB, respectively, across the input bandwidth, while even better performance may be achieved for tonal interferers. The receiver consumes 104 mW from a dual 1.2/2.5 V supply.},

abstract={A 1-GHz Razor FIR accelerator is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process. Timing-error detection is implemented using Razor latches on critical paths. Real-time DSP systems necessitate fixed-latency error-correction, which is achieved using a combination of two distinct mechanisms. First, marginal timing violations are corrected using a time-borrow tracking algorithm that uses timing-error detection information to track excessive time borrowing. Second, persistent unresolved time borrowing is corrected at the end of the pipeline using a low-overhead approximate error-correction stage which is based on interpolation. Measurements at peak throughput of over 1 GS/s demonstrate an energy-efficiency improvement of 37%, while maintaining 10% supply voltage margin.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={3}, 
pages={657-672}, 
abstract={This paper presents a dual-loop ADPLL suitable for video pixel clock generation. The dual-loop architecture where a fast subloop works as a DCO inside a main loop is chosen since it can efficiently suppress the ring oscillator phase noise. In order to satisfy a wide tuning range and fine resolution requirements in the pixel clock PLL, the TDC and DCO with two-step and bottom-up control are employed. An s-domain model is utilized to tune the loop parameters so that the dual-loop PLL has the optimum jitter performance. The measurement results match well with the proposed s-domain model and clearly show the effectiveness of the dual loop in suppressing the phase noise of the DCO. We propose a new cell-based layout technique to avoid performance degradation during automatic placement and routing, which is compatible with the conventional digital design environment. A chip that occupies 0.032 mm2 has been fabricated in the 28-nm CMOS technology. The synthesized DCO shows 1.7-LSB DNL which is close to a full-custom layout. The rms integrated jitter is only 15 ps at 250 MHz, even though PLL operates at the extremely low input frequency of 100 kHz. Power consumption is 3.1 mW at 250 MHz with a 1.0-V supply.},

abstract={Reduced phase noise conversion in a monolithic oscillator suitable for basestation applications is realized by hard limiting and subsequently restoring the resonating waveform. Overdriven transistors hard limit the drain voltage swing and it is shown analytically that this desensitizes the oscillation phase to circuit noise. A pair of tuned, 1:2 step-up transformers in the feedback path restore the fundamental frequency component with sufficient gain to overdrive the transistors forming the oscillator core, with greater selectivity than an equivalent LC tank. The 8 GHz, 65 nm CMOS oscillator prototype targeting the GSM-900 base-station specification consumes 32 mA from 1.5 V. Normalized to 915 MHz, the phase noise measured at 1 MHz offset is -147.7 dBc/Hz, validating predictions from theory and simulation. The measured frequency pushing is less than 16 MHz/V.},

abstract={Digital fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) are an attractive alternative to analog PLLs in the design of frequency synthesizers for wireless applications. However, the main obstacle to their full acceptance in the wireless-systems arena is their higher content of output spurious tones, whose level is ultimately set by the nonlinearity of the time-to-digital converter (TDC). The known methods to improve the linearity of the TDC either increase its dissipation and phase noise or require slow foreground calibrations. By contrast, the class of digital PLLs based on a one-bit TDC driven by a multibit digital-to-time converter (DTC) substantially reduces power dissipation and eliminates the TDC nonlinearity issues. Although its spur performance depends on DTC linearity, the modified architecture enables the application of a background adaptive pre-distortion which does not compromise the PLL phase-noise level and power consumption and is much faster than other calibration techniques. This paper presents a 3.6-GHz digital PLL in 65-nm CMOS, with in-band fractional spurs dropping from -39 to -52 dBc when the pre-distortion is enabled, in-band phase noise of -103 dBc/Hz and power consumption of 4.2 mW.},

year={2014},

number={11}, 
pages={2694-2704}, 
abstract={Thin-film thermoelectric generators (TEG) or graphene-based microbial fuel cells (MFC) are emerging energy harvesting sources with promising power density and sustainability. Nevertheless, conventional transformer-based boost converters commonly used to achieve autonomous low voltage startup encounter low efficiency and potential startup problems with these novel power sources due to their high internal resistance. In this paper, an improved design of transformer-based boost converter addressing these issues is demonstrated with prototype chip fabricated using a standard 0.13 μm CMOS process. The self-start oscillation does not rely on the conventional LC resonant principle, but instead is dependent on the MOS transistor's active-over-leakage current ratio and the mutual coupling between the two identical transformer coils. Circuit design techniques to regulate output voltage and to track system's maximum power point (MPP) of this boost converter are presented. Measurement results confirmed that the proposed circuit works with either low threshold voltage or native MOS transistors. It needs minimum self-startup voltage of 21 mV (at 5.8 μW input power) and minimum startup power of 1.3 μW (at 35 mV input voltage) respectively. The maximum output power is 2 mW and peak power conversion efficiency is 74% at a regulated output voltage of 1 V.},

abstract={This paper describes a compact and low-power frequency synthesizer with quadrature phase output for software-defined radios (SDRs). The proposed synthesizer is constructed using a core phase-locked loop (PLL), which is coupled with a fractional-N injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD). The fractional-N injection-locking operation is achieved by the proposed self-synchronized gating injection technique. The principle of a fractional-N injection locking operation and the concept of the proposed circuits are described in detail. Analysis for predicting the locking range of the proposed fractional-N ILFD is investigated. A digital calibration scheme is adopted in order to compensate for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, this work demonstrates continuous frequency coverage from 10 MHz to 6.6 GHz with quadrature phase output while occupying a small area of 0.38 mm2 and consuming 16 to 26 mW, depending on the output frequency. The normalized phase noise achieves -135.3 dBc/Hz at an offset of 3 MHz and -95.1 dBc/Hz at an offset of 10 kHz, both from a carrier frequency of 1.7 GHz.},

abstract={This paper describes an 8-channel gel-free EEG/electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) acquisition system, consisting of nine active electrodes (AEs) and one back-end (BE) analog signal processor. The AEs amplify the weak EEG signals, while their low output impedance suppresses cable-motion artifacts and 50/60 Hz mains interference. A common-mode feed-forward (CMFF) scheme boosts the CMRR of the AE pairs by 25 dB. The BE post-processes and digitizes the analog outputs of the AEs, it also can configure them via a single-wire pulse width modulation (PWM) protocol. Together, the AEs and BE are capable of recording 8-channel EEG and ETI signals. With EEG recording enabled, ETIs of up to 60 kΩ can be measured, which increases to 550 kΩ when EEG recording is disabled. Each EEG channel has a 1.2 GΩ input impedance (at 20 Hz), 1.75 μVrms (0.5-100 Hz) input-referred noise, 84 dB CMRR and ±250 mV electrode offset rejection capability. The EEG acquisition system was implemented in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS process, and dissipates less than 700 μW from a 1.8 V supply.},

abstract={Behavior of two mutually coupled phase-locked or free-running oscillators with nearby frequencies is studied. In the case of two free-running mutually coupled oscillators, the two oscillators are either locked to a common frequency, or they undergo through a mutual pulling interaction. It is shown that center frequencies of the pulled oscillators come closer, however, they do not necessarily approach toward each other from opposite directions. It is also demonstrated that the strengths of mutual injections as well as the phase-shifts experienced by the mutually injected signals, affect locations of the two center frequencies. The paper also studies impacts of phase-locked loops on the location and magnitude of the sidebands, when the two mutually coupled oscillators are phase-locked. Effects of the phase-shifts endured by the mutually injected signals on the sidebands are also discussed.},

abstract={A careful comparison between alternative topologies to realize low-noise wideband TIAs is carried out in this work. In order to break the tradeoff between noise and bandwidth, the proposed front-end uses two stages, i.e. a low-noise narrowband transimpedance interface followed by an equalizer aimed at restoring the required bandwidth. The technique is especially effective for white noise components. The core first-stage amplifier exploits current reuse for minimum power consumption and is optimized for colored noise reduction. A net 4 × noise power reduction is achieved if compared with a design approach based on a traditional shunt-feedback TIA with the same bandwidth. A complete receiver, interfacing a commercial photodiode, and including the proposed two-stage front-end (TSFE), a limiting amplifier and a wideband output buffer has been realized in 65 nm CMOS. Optical communications tailored to 100GBASE-LR4 standard, which is specified for mid-to-long range transmissions at a channel rate of 25 Gb/s, are targeted. Realized prototypes show a sensitivity of -11.9 dBm at a BER of 10-12 with a PRBS31 input pattern and a transimpedance gain of 83 dBΩ, while tolerating an overall input capacitance of 160 fF. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the best sensitivity performance achieved by 25-Gb/s optical receivers in CMOS, comparable to state-of-the-art BiCMOS realizations.},

pages={1525-1534}, 
abstract={This paper presents a new ripple-reduction technique for spinning-current Hall sensors, which obviates the need for low-pass filtering to suppress the ripple caused by up-modulated sensor offset. A continuous-time ripple-free output is achieved by the use of three ripple reduction loops (RRLs), which continuously sense the offset ripple and then use this information to drive a feedback loop that cancels sensor offset before amplification. Since no low-pass filter is involved, the bandwidth of the resulting system can be much higher than the spinning frequency. Moreover, since the front-end no longer has to process sensor offset, the requirements on its dynamic range can be significantly relaxed. A prototype system consisting of a Hall sensor readout system realized in a 0.18 μm CMOS process was combined with three off-chip RRLs realized with off-chip electronics. At a spinning frequency of 1 kHz, the RRLs reduce the offset ripple by more than 40 dB to about 10 μT, while also achieving low offset (25 μT) and wide bandwidth (over 100 kHz).},

The proposed algorithm relies on the properties of downsampling and orthogonality of sinusoidal signals to estimate the nonlinearity coefficients present in the system and can be operated to remove even and odd order nonlinearities simultaneously. The working of the algorithm is demonstrated on a first-order ring oscillator based ΔΣ ADC, whose performance is limited due to the nonlinearity present in its system. Built in 0.13 μm CMOS, the algorithm improves the SNDR of the ADC by 39 dB, while improving SFDR by 45 dB.},

abstract={An extremely low-power flip-flop (FF) named topologically-compressed flip-flop (TCFF) is proposed. As compared with conventional FFs, the FF reduces power dissipation by 75% at 0% data activity. This power reduction ratio is the highest among FFs that have been reported so far. The reduction is achieved by applying topological compression method, merger of logically equivalent transistors to an unconventional latch structure. The very small number of transistors, only three, connected to clock signal reduces the power drastically, and the smaller total transistor count assures the same cell area as conventional FFs. In addition, fully static full-swing operation makes the cell tolerant of supply voltage and input slew variation. An experimental chip design with 40 nm CMOS technology shows that almost all conventional FFs are replaceable with proposed FF while preserving the same system performance and layout area.},

year={2014},

pages={1271-1284}, 
abstract={This paper presents an energy-efficient feature extraction accelerator design aimed at visual navigation. The hardware-oriented algorithmic modifications such as a circular-shaped sampling region and unified description are proposed to minimize area and energy consumption while maintaining feature extraction quality. A matched-throughput accelerator employs fully-unrolled filters and single-stream descriptor enabled by algorithm-architecture co-optimization, which requires lower clock frequency for the given throughput requirement and reduces hardware cost of description processing elements. Due to the large number of FIFO blocks, a robust low-power FIFO architecture for the ultra-low voltage (ULV) regime is also proposed. This approach leverages shift-latch delay elements and balanced-leakage readout technique to achieve 62% energy savings and 37% delay reduction. We apply these techniques to a feature extraction accelerator that can process 30 fps VGA video in real time and is fabricated in 28 nm LP CMOS technology. The design consumes 2.7 mW with a clock frequency of 27 MHz at Vdd = 470 mV, providing 3.5× better energy efficiency than previous state-of-the-art while extracting features from entire image.},

We further employ a pseudo-differential SAR ADC to save power and area. The core circuit occupies only 0.23 mm 2 and consumes a total of 162 mW from dual 1.2 V/1.1 V supplies. The design achieves a SNDR of 29.4 dB at low frequencies and 26.4 dB at 25 GHz, resulting in a figure-of-merit of 0.79 pJ/conversion-step. As will be further described in the paper, the circuit architecture used in this prototype enables expansion to 25.6 GS/s or 51.2 GS/s via additional interleaving without significantly impacting ERBW.},

abstract={High-speed ADC front-ends in wireline receivers allow for implementing flexible, complex, and robust equalization in the digital domain, as well as easily supporting bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes, such as PAM4 and duobinary. However, the power consumption of these ADC front-ends and subsequent digital signal processing is a major issue. This paper presents a 64-way 6 bit 10 GS/s time-interleaved successive-approximation-based ADC front-end that efficiently incorporates a two-tap embedded FFE and a one-tap embedded DFE, providing the potential for a lower complexity back-end DSP and/or decreased ADC resolution. Fabricated in a 1.1V GP 65nm CMOS process, the ADC with embedded equalization achieves 0.48 pJ/conv.-step FOM, while consuming 79.1mW and occupying 0.33 mm2 core ADC area. The effectiveness of the embedded FFE and DFE is demonstrated with significant timing margin improvement observed for 10 Gb/s operation over several FR4 channels.},

year={2014},

pages={502-512}, 
abstract={Herein we propose a new PWM controller for a DC-DC converter with a Self-aligned Comparator Control (SCC), the purpose of which is to overcome sub-harmonic switching and hysteretic characteristics that are problematic in conventional comparator control schemes. In the proposed scheme, the condition of the output voltage is converted to the form of a phase difference through the SCC block. The main control loop of the converter regulates the inductor current which is built up to an optimum value by using this phase difference. In addition to the SCC, the proposed PWM controller is fully integrated on-chip without off-chip components to decrease the size and cost of the DC-DC converter using a new Switching Noise Robust Charge-pump (SNRC). A boost DC-DC converter with the proposed SCC and SNRC was designed and fabricated in a commercial 0.35 μm BCDMOS process with total controller area of 0.791 mm2 . A maximum efficiency of 90% was achieved at a total output power of 480 mW with a switching frequency of 926 kHz when the input and the output voltages were 3.7 V and 8 V, respectively. Over 85% efficiency was maintained over a wide range of output load current from 40 mA to 300 mA.},

It paves the way to the implementation of a monolithic timing microsystem where the ASIC is part of the housing of a newly designed tiny 131-kHz XTAL to reach extreme module miniaturization (1.5 × 1.1 × 0.7 mm 3) and integrity. As this task is still ongoing, an early demonstration of the generic versatile timing module is presented using a chip-on-board approach with standalone conventionally packaged XTAL and BAW resonators. The module achieves 0.4 μW power dissipation and ±2 ppm stability over -40 °C to 85 °C in RTC mode and can deliver on-demand programmable clocks between 1-50 MHz. The latter are obtained either with a RC PLL or after division of the signal obtained from a 2-GHz BAW DCO at a power dissipation of 100 μW and 5.3 mW, respectively.},

pages={1617-1626}, 
abstract={This work presents the design and measurements of a 0.54 THz signal generator implemented in a 40 nm bulk CMOS technology. An LC-VCO operating at 180 GHz is connected to a nonlinear buffer, which is designed to generate the wanted third harmonic at 540 GHz. The third harmonic is coupled via a transformer to the output. The developed techniques are implemented on two different chips: one with a probe pad for on-wafer measurements and one with an on-chip planar dipole. The measured peak output power using a WR-1.5 probe is -31 dBm at 543 GHz, for 16.8 mW of dc power consumption. By changing value of the parasitic I-MOS varactors of the LC-VCO (“parasitic tuning”), the output frequency can be tuned from 561.5 to 539.6 GHz, resulting in a 21.9 GHz tuning range, which is the highest reported so far for CMOS THz oscillators. The 3-dB output bandwidth is 5.5 GHz. The 540 GHz signal generator with on-chip antenna is used for THz imaging without the use of substrate or focusing lenses, demonstrating some of the capabilities of CMOS for low-cost, mass-produced THz imagers.},

abstract={A 0.5 V CMOS light-to-digital converter (LDC) based on a nonuniform quantizer and off-chip photodiode enables a photodiode bias current (Ibias) range spanning 4 nA to 3.5 μA while consuming less than 4 μW of power. Using an off-chip LED as a modulated light source, measurements with a photodiode current signal having modulation frequency of 1.2 Hz (72 beats per minute) and 0.5% peak-to-peak amplitude relative to Ibias performed at the low and high end of the Ibias range confirm over 30 dB of SNR for an integration bandwidth spanning 0.5 to 5 Hz. Using off-chip digital signal processing of the LDC output, instantaneous period jitter (a proxy for instantaneous heart rate) is measured to be less than 0.45% (rms) of the period, and the high sensitivity of the LDC allows detection of the heart-rate signal from a finger pressed against the off-chip photodiode using only ambient light. Key circuit components of the LDC include a wide range logarithmic digital-to-resistance converter (DRC) utilizing digital multibit ΔΣ modulation to achieve fine resolution and a nonuniform quantizer based on a laddered inverter quantizer (LIQAF) which also acts as a low-noise front-end amplifier and filter.},

abstract={Time-domain analog and digital mixed-signal processing (TD-AMS) is presented. Analog computation is more energy- and area-efficient at the cost of its limited accuracy, whereas digital computation is more versatile and derives greater benefits from technology scaling. Besides, design automation tools for digital circuits are much more sophisticated than those for analog circuits. TD-AMS exploits both advantages, and is a solution better suited to implementing a system on chip including functions for which high computational accuracy is not required, such as error correction, image processing, and machine learning. As an example, a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code decoder with the technique is implemented in 65 nm CMOS and achieves the best reported efficiencies of 10.4 pJ/bit and 6.1 Gbps/mm2.},

abstract={With the emerging need for high-resolution light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technologies in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), we introduce a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that performs time-correlated single-photon counting and complete digital signal processing for a time-of-flight (TOF) sensor. At the core of the 0.18-μm CMOS SoC, we utilize linear arrays of 16 TOF and 32 intensity-only macro-pixels based on single-photon avalanche diodes in an original look-ahead concept, thus acquiring active TOF and passive intensity images simultaneously. The SoC also comprises an array of circuits capable of generating precise triggers upon spatiotemporal correlation events, an array of 64 12-b time-to-digital converters, and 768 kb of SRAM memory. The SoC provides the system-level electronics with a serial and low-bit-rate digital interface for: 1) multi-echo distance; 2) distance reliability; 3) intensity; and 4) passive-only intensity, thus mitigating system-level complexity and cost. A proof-of-concept prototype that achieves depth imaging up to 100 m with a resolution of 202 × 96 pixels at 10 frames/s has been implemented. Quantitative evaluation of the TOF sensor under strong solar background illuminance, i.e., 70 klux, revealed a repeatability error of 14.2 cm throughout the distance range of 100 m, thus leading to a relative precision of 0.14%. Under the same conditions, the relative nonlinearity error was 0.11%. In order to show the suitability of our approach for ADAS-related applications, experimental results in which the depth sensor was operated in typical traffic situations have also been reported.},

abstract={To advance our understanding of the functioning of neuronal ensembles, systems are needed to enable simultaneous recording from a large number of individual neurons at high spatiotemporal resolution and good signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, stimulation capability is highly desirable for investigating, for example, plasticity and learning processes. Here, we present a microelectrode array (MEA) system on a single CMOS die for in vitro recording and stimulation. The system incorporates 26,400 platinum electrodes, fabricated by in-house post-processing, over a large sensing area (3.85 2.10 mm ) with sub-cellular spatial resolution (pitch of 17.5 μm). Owing to an area and power efficient implementation, we were able to integrate 1024 readout channels on chip to record extracellular signals from a user-specified selection of electrodes. These channels feature noise values of 2.4 μV in the action-potential band (300 Hz-10 kHz) and 5.4 μV in the local-field-potential band (1 Hz-300 Hz), and provide programmable gain (up to 78 dB) to accommodate various biological preparations. Amplified and filtered signals are digitized by 10 bit parallel single-slope ADCs at 20 kSamples/s. The system also includes 32 stimulation units, which can elicit neural spikes through either current or voltage pulses. The chip consumes only 75 mW in total, which obviates the need of active cooling even for sensitive cell cultures.},

abstract={Serial link transmitters which efficiently incorporate equalization, while also enabling fast power-state transitioning to leverage dynamic power scaling, are necessary to meet future systems' I/O requirements. This paper presents a scalable voltage-mode transmitter which offers low static power dissipation and adopts an impedance-modulated 2-tap equalizer with analog tap control, thereby obviating driver segmentation and reducing pre-driver complexity and dynamic power. Topologies that allow for rapid power-up/down, including a replica-biased voltage regulator to power the output stages of multiple transmit channels and per-channel quadrature clock generation with injection-locked oscillators (ILO), enable fast power-state transitioning. Energy efficiency is further improved with capacitively driven low-swing global clock distribution and supply scaling at lower data rates, while output eye quality is maintained at low voltages with automatic phase calibration of the local ILO-generated quarter-rate clocks. A prototype fabricated in a general purpose 65 nm CMOS process includes a 2 mm global clock distribution network and two transmitters that support an output swing range of 100-300 mV with up to 12 dB of equalization. The transmitters achieve 8-16 Gb/s operation at 0.65-1.05 pJ/b energy efficiency and sub-3 ns power-up/down times.},

abstract={A fully integrated envelope elimination and restoration (EER) CMOS power amplifier (PA) has been developed for WCDMA and LTE handsets. EER is a supply modulation technique that first divides modulated RF signal into envelope and phase signals and then restores it at a switching PA output. Supply voltage of the switching PA is modulated by the envelope signal through a high-speed supply modulator. EER PA is highly efficient due to the switching PA and the supply modulation. However, it generally has difficulty, especially for a wide bandwidth baseband application like LTE, achieving a wide bandwidth for phase signal path and highly accurate timing between envelope and phase signals. To overcome these challenges, an envelope/phase generator based on a mixer and a limiter was proposed to generate the wide bandwidth phase signal, and a timing aligner based on a delay locked loop with a variable high-pass filter (HPF) was proposed to compensate for the timing mismatch. The chip was implemented in 90 nm CMOS technology. Measured power-added efficiency (PAE) and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) were 39% and -41 dBc for WCDMA, and measured PAE and ACLR E-UTRA1 were 32% and -33 dBc for 20 MHz-BW LTE.},

abstract={This study proposes a thin-film-transistor (TFT) liquid crystal display (LCD) column driver architecture with double time-division multiplexing (TDM) resistor-string digital-to-analog converters (RDACs). A row of sample-and-hold circuits is used as a multiplexer to obtain a high multiplex ratio without requiring low temperature polysilicon TFTs on the display panel. The double TDM operation is proposed to compensate for the kickback noise produced by the output buffer. To improve the linearity of the DAC and the uniformity of the column driver, quasibootstrapped switches are used in the multiplexer to connect the DACs and output buffers. The column driver prototype was implemented by using 0.35 μm/0.5 μm CMOS technology with a worst positive-polarity differential nonlinearity/integral nonlinearity (DNL/INL) of 0.77/0.77 LSB and a negative-polarity DNL/INL of 0.79/0.79 LSB.

abstract={This paper presents an ultra-low power 2.4 GHz FSK/PSK RX for wireless personal/body area networks. A single-channel phase-tracking RX based on a sliding-IF phase-to-digital conversion (SIF-PDC) loop is proposed to directly demodulate and digitize the frequency/phase-modulated information. The sliding-IF frequency plan reduces the power consumption of the multi-phase LO generation. A phase rotator is adopted in SIF-PDC to guarantee frequency stability, i.e., avoid the frequency pulling by interference or frequency drift. It equivalently transforms the RF signal processing from the I/Q amplitude domain to a digital-phase domain, which saves up to nearly 40% on power consumption and relaxes the digital baseband complexity. A phase-domain linear model of the proposed SIF-PDC is presented to analyze the frequency response. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS technology, the presented RX consumes 2.4 mW at 2 Mbps data rate, i.e., 1.2 nJ/b efficiency, and achieves a sensitivity of -92 dBm.},

The proposed ILFM chain employs higher-order LC tanks to generate a rippled phase response around 0 ° over a wide frequency range to significantly enhance the locking range and to eliminate expensive mm-wave frequency calibration loops. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the synthesizer prototype measures a continuous output frequency range from 20.6 to 48.2 GHz with frequency resolution of 220 kHz and output phase noise between -107.0 and -113.9 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset while consuming 148 mW and occupying 1850 × 1130 μm 2.},

abstract={Impedance sensing, together with impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool detecting charge and mass transfer phenomena at complex interfaces between materials. It is widely used in electrochemical interfaces characterization and biosensing techniques. Recently, it has been proposed as a reliable readout technique to probe biomolecular interactions on modified electrodes in enzyme biosensors, DNA biosensors and immunosensors. Unfortunately, the requirements of impedance characterization accuracy, precision and dynamic range demanded by some specific application is usually accomplished by using cumbersome laboratory instrumentation. In this paper we present a fully integrated standalone, high precision, low power, 4-core impedance sensing interface to be implemented in the fast-growing application field of the ubiquitous sensing. The interface is based on a fully digital approach based on a ΔΣ demodulation that is able to achieve 15 bit of resolution, 150 ppm of temperature accuracy and dynamic ranges varying from 86 dB to 95 dB according to the impedance configuration. The 4-core chip has been implemented in 0.35 μm CMOS technology and occupies an area of 9 mm 2.},

abstract={This paper describes a broadband sensor interface IC as part of a miniaturized measurement platform for MHz-to-GHz dielectric spectroscopy. Developed in 0.35 μm 2P/4M RF CMOS, the IC measures frequency-dependent S 21 magnitude and phase of a microfluidic dielectric sensor fabricated in a thick gold-on-glass microfabrication process and loaded with a material-under-test (MUT). The IC architecture implements a broadband frequency response analysis (bFRA) method by first down-converting the sensor response signal from the RF excitation frequency to an intermediate frequency (IF) of 1 MHz using a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and active mixer, followed by down-converting the IF signal to dc using a coherent detector employing IF amplification stages with programmable gain, a passive mixer driven by in-phase (I) and quadrature-phase (Q) signals and an active-RC low-pass filter (LPF). The sensor interfaced with the IC is fully capable of differentiating among deionized (DI) water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), ethanol and methanol in tests conducted at four different excitation frequencies of 50 MHz, 500 MHz, 1 GHz and 3 GHz. Further, dielectric readings of ethanol from the sensor interfaced with the IC at five excitation frequencies in the range of 50 MHz to 2 GHz are in excellent agreement (error <;1%) with those from using a vector network analyzer (VNA) as the sensor readout. A bulk-solution reference measurement by an Agilent 85070E dielectric probe kit interfaced with a VNA is also performed to verify proof-of-concept feasibility in conducting MHz-to-GHz dielectric spectroscopy with a miniaturized measurement platform using μL-sample volumes.},

abstract={Event-based dynamic vision sensors (DVSs) asynchronously report log intensity changes. Their high dynamic range, sub-ms latency and sparse output make them useful in applications such as robotics and real-time tracking. However they discard absolute intensity information which is useful for object recognition and classification. This paper presents a dynamic and active pixel vision sensor (DAVIS) which addresses this deficiency by outputting asynchronous DVS events and synchronous global shutter frames concurrently. The active pixel sensor (APS) circuits and the DVS circuits within a pixel share a single photodiode. Measurements from a 240×180 sensor array of 18.5 μm 2 pixels fabricated in a 0.18 μm 6M1P CMOS image sensor (CIS) technology show a dynamic range of 130 dB with 11% contrast detection threshold, minimum 3 μs latency, and 3.5% contrast matching for the DVS pathway; and a 51 dB dynamic range with 0.5% FPN for the APS readout.},

abstract={A 2.4 GHz ZigBee receiver unifying a balun-LNA-I/Q-mixer (Blixer) and a baseband (BB) hybrid filter in one cell is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. Without any external components, wideband input matching and passive pre-gain are concurrently achieved via co-optimizing an integrated low-Q network with a balun-LNA. The latter also features active-gain boosting and partial-noise canceling to enhance the gain and noise figure (NF). Above the balun-LNA are I/Q double-balanced mixers driven by a 4-phase 25% LO for downconversion and gain-phase balancing. The generated BB currents are immediately filtered by an IF-noise-shaping current-mode Biquad and a complex-pole load, offering first-order image rejection and third-order channel selection directly atop the Blixer. Together with other BB and LO circuitries, the receiver measures 8.5 dB NF, 57 dB gain and -6-dBm IIP3out-band at 1.7 mW power and 0.24 mm2 die size. The S11-bandwidth (<;-10 dB) covers 2.25 to 3.55 GHz being robust to packaging variations. Most performance metrics compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={This paper presents an X-band chirp radar transceiver with bandwidth reduction for range detection. The radar transceiver includes a super-heterodyne receiver including an ADC, a direct-digital synthesizer (DDS) based transmitter and a phase-locked loop (PLL) synthesizer. In a modified Weaver architecture, the down-converted baseband signal is further mixed with another chirp signal through stretch processing. The resulting waveform bandwidth is greatly reduced and thus relaxes the power and bandwidth requirements of the on-chip ADC. Therefore, the proposed radar transceiver achieves power and bandwidth reductions without degrading its range resolution. The radar-on-chip (RoC) MMIC was implemented in a 0.13 μm SiGe technology with die area of 3.5 × 2.5 mm2. With a 2.2 V supply for analog/RF circuits and a 1.5 V supply for the digital portion, the chip consumes 326 mW in the receive mode and 333 mW in the transmit mode, respectively.},

abstract={This paper presents the implementation details and silicon results of a 3 GHz dual-core ARM Cortex TM -A9 (A9) manufactured in the 28 nm planar Ultra-Thin Box and Body Fully-Depleted CMOS (UTBB FD-SOI) technology. The implementation is based on a fully synthesizable standard design flow. The design exploits the important flexibility provided by the FD-SOI technology, notably a wide Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) range, from 0.52 V to 1.37 V, and Forward Body Bias (FBB) techniques up to 1.3 V. Detailed explanations of the body-biasing techniques specific to this technology are largely presented, in the context of a multi- VT co-integration, which enable this energy efficient silicon implementation. The system integrates all the advanced IPs for energy efficiency as well as the body bias generator and a fast (μs range) dynamic body bias management capability. The measured dual core CPU maximum operation frequency is 3 GHz (for 1.37 V) and it can be operated down to 300 MHz (for 0.52 V) in full continuous DVFS. The obtained relative performance, with respect to an equivalent planar 28 nm bulk CMOS chip, shows an improvement of +237% at 0.6 V, or +544% at 0.61 V with 1.3 V FBB.},

pages={2172-2186}, 
abstract={This paper presents a two-point modulator architecture which is immune to the nonlinear effect of the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). By utilizing a 1 bit ΔΣ modulation with embedded finite-impulse response (FIR) filtering the high-pass modulation path does not suffer from the DCO gain nonlinearity, thus requiring absolute gain calibration only. The digital FIR filter in the high-pass modulation path not only suppresses quantization noise but also reduces noise coupling with time-interleaved switching of partitioned capacitors. A hybrid FIR filtering method is also employed for the low-pass modulation path to enhance the linearity of the fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL). A 1.8 GHz two-point modulator based on a semi-digital PLL is implemented in 65 nm CMOS consuming 6.9 mW from a 1 V supply. At the divide-by-2 output frequency of 913.2 MHz, the error-vector magnitude (EVM) values of 1.79% and 1.63% are achieved with 1.08 Mb/s and 270 kb/s GMSK modulation respectively. When the 1.08 Mb/s GFSK modulation is performed with the same PLL parameters, the EVM value of 1.96% is achieved.},

abstract={A one-chip optical transceiver for board-to-board transmission was developed by integrating an analog frontend (FE) with a data-format-conversion (DFC) block in 65-nm CMOS process technology. It was experimentally demonstrated that this transceiver can convert 10x 6.25-Gb/s electrical signals to 4x 25-Gb/s optical signals with 25% redundancy that improves resilience against possible laser diode (LD) failure. To alleviate degradation of the optical link due to power-supply variations, a power-supply-noise-tolerant 25-Gb/s analog FE (consisting of a TIA with a noise canceller and a fully differential LD driver) is proposed. The noise canceller can keep the power-supply variation below 0.2 mV at frequencies down to 1 MHz, and the fully differential LD driver can keep power-supply current variation below 0.64 mApp/ch, despite a large modulation current of 20 mApp. As for the transmission performance of the transceiver, eye diagrams experimentally confirmed 25-Gb/s and 6.25-Gb/s data-transmission rates. A 25-Gb/s optical-link test on the transceiver demonstrated error-free operation at -6.1-dBm OMA. Moreover, an image-transfer test on the transceiver operating at a data rate of 20 Gb/s through a 100-m multi-mode fiber was demonstrated. Total power consumption of the transceiver (including optics) was 2.2 W at full-channel operation.},

abstract={In this paper, a 13.56 MHz CMOS near-field inductive link power supply (ILPS) that can deliver 20 mA output current for implantable medical devices (IMDs) is proposed and fabricated. In the proposed ILPS, the pair of inductive link coils is constructed in the spiral shape with a ferrite core to save space and increase efficiency. Experimental results have shown that the near-field coils can transmit power at the resonant frequency of 13.56 MHz with the transmission efficiency up to 76.3%. The CMOS power regulator is composed of active voltage doubler rectifier (VD) and low-dropout regulators (LDOs). In the active VD with the comparator, the input offset voltage is adjustable for delay compensation and a start-up control circuit is added to achieve robust start-up mechanism. On-chip delay compensation control with SR-latches is proposed to prevent from error glitch switching on offset voltage control and achieve accurate delay compensation so that the reverse current conduction can be avoided and the efficiency can be increased. Three fully-integrated LDOs with rectifier output voltage of 2 V to 1.8 V are realized for analog (ALDO), digital (DLDO), and reference-voltage (RLDO) circuits. Thus the performance of individual LDO can be optimized. The measured output ripple voltage of the active VD is 10.4 mV. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 85% under 20 mA output current. The measured dropout voltage is 384 mV. As compared with other designs, the proposed ILPS has lower ripple voltages, lower dropout voltage, and higher PCE.},

In this work, we give a method for stabilizing a CTDSM that uses an FIR feedback DAC. Further, we show that increasing the number of taps beyond a certain number (dependent on the architecture and oversampling ratio of the modulator) does not improve performance. The results of our analysis are incorporated in the design of a third-order audio CTDSM which achieves a peak A-weighted SNR of 102.3 dB (raw SNR of 98.9 dB) and a spurious-free dynamic range of 106 dB in a 24 kHz bandwidth, while consuming only 280 μW from a 1.8 V supply.},

abstract={Several circuit-level techniques are described which are used to reduce or cancel thermal noise and break the so-called kT/C limit. kT/C noise describes the total thermal noise power added to a signal when a sample is taken on a capacitor. In the first proposed technique, the sampled thermal noise is reduced by altering the relationship between the sampling bandwidth and the dominant noise source, providing a powerful, new degree of freedom in circuit design. In the second proposed technique, thermal noise sampled on an input capacitor is actively canceled using an amplifier, so that the noise at the amplifier output can be controlled independently of input capacitor size. Measurements from two test chips are presented which demonstrate sampled thermal noise power reduction of 48% and 67%, respectively, when compared with conventional kT/C-limited sampling.},

abstract={This paper presents a direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDFS) based on the nonlinear DAC with a maximum operating frequency of 2 GHz. This work proposes three design methods to enhance the performance of a DDFS. First, a multi-level momentarily activated bias is proposed to reduce power dissipation in the phase accumulator. Second, a coarse phase-based consecutive fine amplitude grouping scheme is presented to reduce hardware complexity and power consumption in the digital decoder. Third, the mixed-wave conversion topology in the nonlinear DAC is proposed to improve the output spectral purity. The DDFS with 9 bit amplitude resolution is capable of producing a minimum spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 55.1 dBc up to Nyquist frequency at the clock frequency of 2 GHz. The prototype DDFS is fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS. It occupies an active area of 0.1 mm 2 with a total power dissipation of 130 mW. The figure of merit of this DDFS is 8944 GHz · 2 (SFDR/6) /W.},

abstract={In order to eliminate the limitation of a narrow frequency range of conventional resonant clocking, intermittent resonant clocking (IRC) is proposed for near/sub-threshold logic circuits.

Measurement results show that IRC reduces the clock power by 36% at 980 kHz and the clock leakage power by 81% compared with conventional non-resonant clocking when IRC is applied to the adder array with latches.

abstract={This paper presents transceivers and a wireless power delivery system for a Body-Area Network (BAN) that uses an e-textiles-based physical layer (PHY) capable of linking a diverse set of sensor nodes monitoring vital signs on the user's body. A central base station in the network controls power delivery and communication resource allotment for every node using a general-purpose on-chip Node Network Interface (NNI). The architecture of the network ensures fault-tolerance, reconfigurability and ease of use through a dual wireless-wireline topology. The nodes are powered at a peak end-to-end efficiency of 1.2% and can transmit measured data at a peak rate of 1 Mb/s. Modulation schemes for communication in both directions have been chosen and a Medium Access and Control (MAC) protocol has been designed and implemented on chip to reduce complexity at the power-constrained nodes, and move it to the base station. While transferring power to a single node at maximum efficiency, the base station consumes 2.9 mW power and the node recovers 34 µW, of which 14 µW is used to power the network interface circuits while the rest can be used to power signal acquisition circuitry. Fabricated in 0.18 µm CMOS technology, the base station and the NNI occupy 2.95 mm 2 and 1.46 mm 2 area, respectively.},

abstract={This paper discusses concurrent design and analysis of the first 8.5 kV electrostatic discharge (ESD) protected single-pole ten-throw (SP10T) transmit/receive (T/R) switch for quad-band (0.85/0.9/1.8/1.9 GHz) GSM and multiple-band WCDMA smartphones. Implemented in a 0.18 μm SOI CMOS, this SP10T employs a series-shunt topology for the time-division duplex (TDD) transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx), and frequency-division duplex (FDD) transmitting/receiving (TRx) branches to handle the high GSM transmitter power. The measured P0.1 dB, insertion loss and Tx-Rx isolation in the lower/upper bands are 36.4/34.2 dBm, 0.48/0.81 dB and 43/40 dB, respectively, comparable to commercial products with no/little ESD protection in high-cost SOS and GaAs technologies. Feed-forward capacitor (FFC) and AC-floating bias techniques are used to further improve the linearity. An ESD-switch co-design technique is developed that enables simultaneous whole-chip design optimization for both ESD protection and SP10T circuits.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a time-based equalization scheme to implement transmit de-emphasis in voltage-mode drivers. Using two-level pulse-width modulation, this work decouples the tradeoff between impedance matching, output swing, and de-emphasis resolution in conventional voltage-mode drivers using voltage-based de-emphasis. A prototype PWM-based 5 Gb/s voltage-mode transmitter was implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process and characterized across different channels and output swings. The horizontal/vertical eye opening (BER=10-12) at the end of 60 and 96 in stripline channels is 78 mv/0.6 UI and 8 mV/0.3 UI, respectively. Duty cycle distortion of the clock severely reduced the margins, so the overall performance can be improved by applying duty-cycle correction to clock signals. The transmitter consumes a total power 15.6 mW of which 2.5 mW is consumed in the digital PLL and 7.8 mW in the pre-/output drivers and regulators. This translates to a power efficiency of 3.1 mW/Gb/s, which compares favorably with the state of the art.},

pages={1017-1026}, 
abstract={An adaptive PLL that maximizes the timing compensation between clock and data, commonly referred to as the clock data compensation effect, is demonstrated in 32 nm SOI. A number of previous adaptive PLL designs have successfully proven that processor operating speed can be improved by modulating the clock path delay or the PLL output clock period using the resonant supply noise. In this work, we take the adaptive PLL concept one step further by achieving optimal clock data compensation across a wide range of PVT and operating conditions. This was accomplished by an automated supply-noise sensitivity tracking loop which constantly monitors any timing errors occurring in a critical path replica circuit. Compared to a conventional PLL, the proposed design achieves up to a 15.6% improvement in processor Fmax or a 9.8% reduced dynamic power consumption under an iso-operating frequency for a realistic supply noise. Additionally, a 92.1% reduction in PLL area was achieved by employing ultra-high density deep trench capacitors in the loop filter.},

pages={1419-1436}, 
abstract={Photonic interconnects are a promising technology to meet the bandwidth demands of next-generation high-performance computing systems. This paper presents silicon photonic transceiver circuits for a microring resonator-based optical interconnect architecture in a 1 V standard 65 nm CMOS technology. The transmitter circuits incorporate high-swing ( 2Vpp and 4Vpp) drivers with nonlinear pre-emphasis and automatic bias-based tuning for resonance wavelength stabilization. An optical forwarded-clock adaptive inverter-based transimpedance amplifier (TIA) receiver trades off power for varying link budgets by employing an on-die eye monitor and scaling the TIA supply for the required sensitivity. At 5 Gb/s operation, the 4Vpp transmitter achieves 12.7 dB extinction ratio with 4.04 mW power consumption, excluding laser power, when driving wire-bonded modulators designed in a 130 nm SOI process, while a 0.28 nm tuning range is obtained at 6.8 μW/GHz efficiency with the bias-based tuning scheme implemented with the 2Vpp transmitter. When tested with a wire-bonded 150 fF p-i-n photodetector, the receiver achieves -9 dBm sensitivity at a BER=10-9 and consumes 2.2 mW at 8 Gb/s. Testing with an on-die test structure emulating a low-capacitance waveguide photodetector yields 17 μApp sensitivity at 10 Gb/s and more than 40% power reduction with higher input current levels.},

abstract={A continuous-time 7-tap FIR equalizer tailored to dispersion compensation in multi-mode fiber links is presented. By using a novel active delay line, the ultra-compact equalizer is very flexible, maintaining optimal performances and power scalability over a wide range of input data-rates. Particular care is taken to address critical issues of continuous-time realizations, such as noise, linearity and dynamic range. All-pass stages, realized with a simple circuit topology featuring high linearity and wide bandwidth, are investigated to implement the active delay line elements. Filter tap coefficients are realized with programmable transconductors and output currents are summed through a transimpedance amplifier, providing simultaneously high gain and wide bandwidth. Extensive experimental results, carried out on test chips realized in 28 nm LP CMOS technology, are presented. The equalizer demonstrates successful operation with variable data-rates ranging from 10 Gb/s to 25 Gb/s and power dissipation scalable from 55 mW to 90 mW. Compared to previously reported high-speed FIR equalizers, the proposed solution accepts the largest variation of the input data-rate with state-of-the-art power efficiency and core silicon area of only 0.085 mm 2, meeting the demand of emerging 400 Gb/s standards.},

title={Low-Noise Active Cancellation of Transmitter Leakage and Transmitter Noise in Broadband Wireless Receivers for FDD/Co-Existence}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3046-3062}, 
abstract={A technique for active cancellation of transmitter self-interference in wideband receivers is presented. The active TX leakage cancellation circuitry is embedded within a noise-cancelling low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) so that the noise and the distortion of the cancellation circuitry are cancelled, resulting in a noise-cancelling, self-interference cancelling receiver (NC-SIC RX). A second-point cancellation of TX noise in the RX band is performed after the LNTA so that the noise impact of the second canceller is reduced. Theoretical analyses related to the benefits and limits of active self-interference cancellation as well as the simultaneous cancellation of the noise and distortion of the cancellation circuitry are presented. A 0.3-1.7 GHz receiver with the proposed active cancellation is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. The proposed scheme can cancel up to +2 dBm peak TX leakage at the receiver input. The triple beat at +2 dBm peak TX leakage is 68 dB and the effective IIP3 is +33 dBm, representing increases of 38 and 19 dB, respectively, over the receiver without cancellation. The associated increase in receiver NF is less than 0.8 dB. In addition, the scheme effectively suppresses TX noise in RX band by up to 13 dB. The technique can be more generally viewed as an active combining structure that has ideally no noise penalty and is able to handle large signals without generating distortion and can be applied to any scenario where a replica of an interference signal can be generated.},

abstract={We present a 346 μm2 reference-free, asynchronous VCO-based sensor interface circuit demonstrated in 28 nm LP bulk CMOS.

By using a straightforward VCO design, it achieves wide resolution, voltage scalability, and process portability while consuming only ~1/100th the area of prior approaches and avoiding costly reference circuitry. In the design measured for this paper, resolution can be scaled from 2.8 to 11.7 bits and VDD from 500 mV to 1.0 V. The design contains a single-point calibration scheme that works across temperature, voltage, and resolution settings. Minimum power consumption is 11.7 μW at 0.6 V VDD and minimum energy per conversion step is 41.2 fJ/b at 0.6 V VDD and 9.42 bits of effective resolution.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={1}, 
pages={95-106}, 
abstract={This paper presents a nonvolatile logic (NVL)-based 32-b microcontroller system-on-chip (SoC) that backs up its working state (all flip-flops) upon receiving a power interrupt, has zero leakage in sleep mode, and needs less than 400 ns to restore the system state upon power-up. Nonvolatile Fe-Cap-based mini-arrays backup the machine state and allow the chip to wake up instantly after a power cycle. Without NVL, a chip would either have to keep all flip-flops powered, resulting in high standby power, or waste energy and time rebooting after power-up. NVL allows systems to use leakier processes to achieve higher performance/lower dynamic power while still having zero leakage in the sleep mode. Optimized system, architecture, and circuit techniques are presented that make NVL practical by adding only 3.6% to the SoC area. Since nonvolatile elements are added to the SoC, reliability and testability have to be key features of the design. This is the first NVL SoC with measured NVL bitcell read signal margin data and extensive test and debug capabilities. The chip is fabricated in a commercial 130-nm low-leakage process and uses a single 1.5-V power supply.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2547-2559}, 
abstract={N-path passive-mixer-first receivers suffer from a tight tradeoff between noise figure (NF), linearity and power due to no RF gain. This paper describes an extensively-current-reuse wideband receiver exploiting parallel N-path active/passive mixers. The key features are: 1) a stacked RF-to-BB front-end with an 8-path active mixer realizing RF amplification, harmonic-recombination (HR) downconversion and BB filtering in the current domain for better linearity and power efficiency; 2) a feedforward 8-path passive mixer enabling LO-defined input impedance matching without external components, while offering frequency-translated bandpass filtering and noise cancelling; 3) a single-MOS pole-zero low-pass filter (LPF) permitting both RF and BB filtering at low voltage headroom consumption, while easing the tradeoff between the in-/out-of-band linearity, and 4) a BB-only two-stage HR amplifier boosting the third and fifth harmonic rejection ratios (HRR3,5) with low hardware intricacy. Measurements over the TV bands (0.15 to 0.85 GHz) manifest favorable NF (4.6±0.9 dB) and out-of-band IIP2/IIP3 (+61/+17.4 dBm) at small power (10.6 to 16.2 mW) and area (0.55 mm2). The HRR2-6 are > 51 dB without any calibration or tuning. The ultimate out-of-band P-1dB is > +2.5 dBm. The BB stopband rejection is > 86 dB at 150 MHz offset.},

abstract={A noncontact and housing-less thin-thick connecting method was developed for mobile industry processor interface (MIPI) applications. This paper describes the world's first 0.15-mm-thick connector using a vertical directional coupler (VDC) which enables simultaneous two-link communication with one coupler without fatal performance degradation. We have analyzed the conditions for isolating two links in a coupler, and the design method is discussed. A fully balanced pulse transmitter implemented in 90-nm CMOS technology significantly suppressed electromagnetic interference (EMI), which agrees well with MIPI requirements. An experimental liquid crystal display interface system reached a maximum data rate of 2.3 Gb/s/link at a bit error rate of less than 10-12 and a power consumption of 1.47 pJ/b. The timing margin of single link was 320 ps ( =64% U.I.) and of two links was 305 ps ( =61% U.I.) at 2.0 Gb/s.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={3}, 
pages={783-794}, 
abstract={The majority of the power consumption of a high-throughput LDPC decoder is spent on memory. Unlike in a general-purpose processor, the memory access in an LDPC decoder is deterministic and the access window is short. We take advantage of the unique memory access characteristic to design a non-refresh eDRAM that holds data for the necessary access window, and further improve its access time by trading off the excess retention time. The resulting 3T eDRAM cell is designed to balance wordline coupling to reliably retain data for a fast access. We integrate 32 5x210 non-refresh eDRAM arrays in a row-parallel LDPC decoder suitable for the IEEE 802.11ad standard. Memory refresh is eliminated and random access is replaced with a simple sequential addressing. With row merging and dual-frame processing, the 1.6 mm 2 65 nm LDPC decoder chip achieves a peak throughput of 9 Gb/s at 89.5 pJ/b, of which only 21% is spent on eDRAMs. With voltage and frequency scaling, the power consumption of the LDPC decoder is reduced to 37.7 mW for a 1.5 Gb/s throughput at 35.6 pJ/b.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={3}, 
pages={595-607}, 
abstract={Radio transceivers capable of dynamic spectrum access require frequency-agile transmitters with a clean output spectrum. High- Q filters are difficult to implement on chip and have limited tuning range. Transmitters with high linearity and broadband harmonic rejection can be more flexible and require less filtering. However, traditional harmonic rejection mixers suppress only a few harmonics. This paper presents an 8-path polyphase transmitter, which exploits mixer-LO duty-cycle control and a tunable first-order RC low-pass filter to suppress ALL harmonics to below -40 dBc. The optimum duty-cycle theoretically is 43.65% and a resolution of better than 0.1% is required to keep the spread in harmonic rejection within 1 dB. We propose a simple monotonic duty-cycle control circuit and show by design equations and measurements that it achieves the required resolution over three octaves of frequency range. Also, analysis indicates that LO duty-cycle reduction compared with 50% improves power upconverter efficiency. A transmitter realized in 0.16- μm CMOS works from 100 to 800 MHz at a maximum single-tone output power of 10.8 dBm with an efficiency of 8.7%, outperforming previous designs. The OIP3 is >21 dBm, while the LO leakage and image rejection is better than -45 dBc.},

The optimal power consumption in the complementary (P-N) configuration is reduced by 75% compared to the single-switch-pair (N-only) configuration, while the FoM is kept constant. Measurements on a 55 nm CMOS 4 GHz DCO prototype show a minimum phase noise of -129.3 dBc/Hz at 2 MHz offset from the carrier in the P-N configuration, and of -134.7 dBc/Hz in the N-only configuration, with a phase noise difference very close to the 6 dB expected from theory. The current consumption is 6 mA and 24 mA, respectively, resulting in approximately the same FoM of -185 dBc/Hz.},

abstract={We present design and measurement details for a 0-3 multi-stage noise-shaping (MASH) ADC that achieves a dynamic range of 88 dB over 53 MHz signal bandwidth. The ADC utilizes a zeroth-order front-end, i.e., a 17-level flash ADC, to perform a coarse quantization and a third-order 7-level continuous-time ΔΣ back-end to digitize the residue error of the front-end. The ADC achieves the high thermal noise power efficiency of a continuous-time feedforward ΔΣ modulator and the flat signal transfer function of a flash ADC. The test chip, implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process, clocks at 3.2 GHz. The average noise spectral density with small input signals is -167 dBFS/Hz and the dynamic range is 88 dB. The test chip ADC consumes a total power of 235 mW from triple power supplies of 0.9/1.8/-1.0 V. The thermal-noise figure-of-merit, defined as FOM = DR + 10log 10 (BW/P) is 171.6 dB.},

year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1571-1579}, 
abstract={A versatile controller architecture, used in current-mode floating buck converters for LED driving, is developed. State-of-the-art controllers rely on a fixed switching period and variable duty cycle, focusing on current averaging circuits. Instead, the proposed controller architecture is based on fixed peak current and adaptable off time as the average current control method. The control loop is comprised of an averaging block, transconductance amplifier, and an innovative time modulator. This modulator is intended to provide constant control loop response regardless of input voltage, current storage inductor, and number of LEDs in order to improve converter applicability for LED drivers. Fabricated in a 5 V standard 0.5 μm CMOS technology, the prototype controller is implemented and tested in a current-mode floating buck converter. The converter exhibits sound continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation for input voltages between 11 and 20 V, and a wide inductor range of 100-1000 μH. In all instances, the measured average LED current variation was lower than 10% of the desired value. A maximum conversion efficiency of 91% is obtained when driving 50 mA through four LEDs (with 14 V input voltage and an inductor of 470 μH). A stable CCM converter operation is also proven by simulation for nine LEDs and 45 V input voltage.},

volume={49}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2277-2291}, 
abstract={Although miniaturized piezoelectric transducers usually derive more power from motion than their electrostatic and electromagnetic counterparts, they still generate little power. The reason for this is that the electromechanical coupling factor is low, which means the damping force that tiny transducers impose on vibrations (when drawing power) is hardly noticeable. The single-inductor 0.35 μm CMOS piezoelectric harvester proposed in this paper counters this deficiency by investing energy from the battery into the transducer. The idea is to strengthen the electrostatic force against which vibrations work. This way, the circuit draws more power from the transducer, up to 79 μW from a 2.7 cm piezoelectric cantilever that is driven up to 0.25 m/s 2 . Of the 79 μW drawn at 0.25 m/s 2 when investing 91 nJ of battery energy, the system outputs 52 μW, which is 3.6 times more output power than the 14.5 μW that a full-wave bridge rectifier with zero-volt diodes at its maximum power point can deliver from the same source. With 630 nW lost to the controller, power-conversion efficiency peaks at 69% when the harvester outputs 46 μW of the 67 μW it draws from the transducer at 0.25 m/s 2 when investing 0.8 nJ of battery energy.},

abstract={This paper presents a nW power management unit (PMU) for an autonomous wireless sensor that sustains itself by harvesting energy from the endocochlear potential (EP), the 70-100 mV electrochemical bio-potential inside the mammalian ear. Due to the anatomical constraints inside the inner ear, the total extractable power from the EP is limited close to 1.1-6.25 nW. A nW boost converter is used to increase the input voltage (30-55 mV) to a higher voltage (0.8-1.1 V) usable by CMOS circuits in the sensor. A pW charge pump circuit is used to minimize the leakage in the boost converter. Furthermore, ultralow-power control circuits consisting of digital implementations of input impedance adjustment circuits and zero current switching circuits along with Timer and Reference circuits keep the quiescent power of the PMU down to 544 pW. The designed boost converter achieves a peak power conversion efficiency of 56%. The PMU can sustain itself, and a duty-cyled ultralow-power load while extracting power from the EP of a live guinea pig. The PMU circuits have been implemented on a 0.18- μm CMOS process.},

abstract={A software-defined radio (SDR) wireless receiver leveraging discrete-time (DT) RF signal processing is introduced.

A frequency tunable high-Q 2nd-order bandpass input impedance is synthesized by the DT RF signal processor, which enhances the front-end interference rejection and frequency selectivity. A proof-of-concept SDR receiver prototype, including a 65 nm LP CMOS chip and a custom designed board, is presented. The highly programmable chip allows independent control of individual block parameters and bias operating points for optimum performance under various signal scenarios. The 0.5-to-3 GHz SDR receiver achieves out-of-band IIP3 > 11 dBm, IIP2 > 46 dBm, uncalibrated 3rd and 5th order harmonic rejection exceeding 46 dB and 51 dB, respectively, and can handle up to -5 dBm blockers with less than 5 dB degradation in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the blocker offset frequency is 10 times the signal bandwidth irrespective of the center frequency.},

pages={673-682}, 
abstract={A 6-bit, 1-GS/s subranging analog-to-digital converter (ADC) implemented in 65-nm CMOS is developed. The same capacitor DACs (CDACs) are used to sample the analog signals, thereby eliminating the errors between the coarse and fine decisions that occur when two different samplers are used to capture the signal. Both decisions use the same comparators, and a digitally assisted calibration circuit compensates for the errors in the different threshold levels used for the two decisions. This calibration eliminates redundant comparators, and thus, reduces the area. Reference voltages generators, which are implemented using resistor ladders in conventional subranging ADCs, are eliminated thanks to the use of the CDACs together with interpolation in the comparators. This solves two problems related to the resistor ladder, namely, the trade-off between the settling time and the static-current consumption and signal dependent on-resistance of switches connected to intermediate potential nodes. A test chip fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology operates at 1 GS/s with SNDR of 32.8 dB. Its active area is 0.044 mm2, and its power consumption is 9.9 mW at a 1.1-V supply voltage.},

The SoC uniquely integrates electrical stimulation with embedded timing management for generation of neurochemical patterns and 400 V/s fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) sensing for subsequent assessment of fidelity in the generated profiles, and manages a novel switched-electrode scheme that eliminates the possibility of large stimulus artifacts adversely affecting electrochemistry. The SoC also leverages the discontinuous sampling inherent in FSCV to reduce the sensing power consumption by 87.5% to 9.3 μW from 2.5 V using a duty-cycled, 3rd-order, continuous-time, ΔΣ modulator (CT-ΔΣM) with an input-referred noise current of 78 pArms (dc - 5 kHz) within an input current range of ±950 nA. Utilizing a transfer function that relates electrical stimulation of dopamine axons traversing the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to evoked extracellular dopamine dynamics in the dorsal striatum of the forebrain, the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured dopamine temporal profiles was found to be 0.95 in an anesthetized rat.},

abstract={If the modulus of the digital delta-sigma modulator (DΔΣM) in a fractional- N frequency synthesizer is a power of two, then the output frequency is constrained to be a rational multiple of the phase detector frequency (fPD), where the denominator of the rational multiplier is a power of two. If the required output frequency is not related to fPD in this way, one is forced to approximate the ratio by using a small programmable modulus DΔΣM or a very large power-of-two modulus. Both of these solutions involve additional hardware. Furthermore, the programmable modulus solution can suffer from spurs, while the large power of two lacks accuracy. This paper presents a new solution, based on mixed-radix algebra, where the required ratio is formed by combining two different moduli. The programmable modulus solves the accuracy problem, while the large power-of-two modulus minimizes the spur content. In addition, the phase detector can be clocked at high speed. This paper explains the theoretical foundations of the method, elaborates a design methodology, and presents measured results for an 0.18 μm SiGe BiCMOS prototype.},

abstract={This paper presents a time-interleaved (TI) SAR ADC which enables background timing skew calibration without a separate timing reference channel and enhances the conversion speed of each SAR channel. The proposed ADC incorporates a flash ADC operating at the full sampling rate of the TI ADC. The flash ADC output is multiplexed to resolve MSBs of the SAR channels. Because the full-speed flash ADC does not suffer from timing skew errors, the flash ADC output is also used as a timing reference to estimate the timing skew of the TI SAR ADCs. A prototype ADC is designed and fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. After background timing skew calibration, 51.4 dB SNDR, 59.1 dB SFDR, and ±1.0 LSB INL/DNL are achieved at 1 GS/s with a Nyquist rate input signal. The power consumption is 18.9 mW from a 1.0 V supply, which corresponds to 62.3 fJ/step FoM.},

title={Positive-Feedback Level Shifter Logic for Large-Area Electronics},

pages={524-535}, 
abstract={Positive-feedback Level Shifter (PLS) logic is proposed in this paper for the design of unipolar digital circuits manufactured at low temperature on foil using organic or metal-oxide semiconductors. Positive feedback and a suitable control voltage provide high gain and a symmetrical input-output characteristic even in presence of large TFT variations, enabling robust digital design. The measured gain improves from 13 dB in traditional Zero-Vgs inverters to 76 dB in PLS inverters; the average noise margin increases from 2.58 V (Zero-Vgs) to 6.82 V (PLS) at 20 V supply. Assuming that a positive noise margin for each gate is the only requirement to obtain a fully functional digital circuit, the maximum number of logic gates compatible with a 90% yield improves from 200 Zero-Vgs inverters to above 24 million PLS inverters. A 240-stage PLS shift-register exploiting 13,440 organic TFTs is indeed successfully measured. This is to the authors' knowledge the organic circuit with the highest transistor count ever demonstrated. The control voltage, always within the supply rails, enables automatic correction of the process variations using linear control circuits. The proposed approach will enable a strong increase in the complexity of large-area electronics on foil, with great benefit to applications like flexible displays and large-area sensing surfaces.},

abstract={This paper presents a floating-buck dimmable LED driver for solid-state lighting applications. In the proposed driver, an adaptive timing difference compensation (ATDC) is developed to adaptively adjust the off-time of the low-side power switch to enable the driver to achieve high accuracy of the average LED current over a wide range of input voltages and number of output LED loads, fast settling time, and high operation frequency. The power efficiency benefits from the capabilities of using synchronous rectifier and having no sensing resistor in the power stage. The synchronous rectification under high input supply voltage is enabled by a proposed high-speed and low-power gate driver with pseudo-digital level shifters. Implemented in a 0.35 μm 50 V CMOS process, experimental results show that the proposed LED driver can operate at 1 MHz and achieve peak power efficiency of 93% to support a wide range of series-connected output LEDs from 1 to 10 and a wide input range from 10 to 40 V. The proposed LED driver has only 2.8% current error from the average LED current of 345 mA and settles within 8.5 μs after triggering the dimming condition, improving the settling time by 14 times compared with the state-of-the-art LED drivers.},

title={A Fast-Response Hybrid SIMO Power Converter with Adaptive Current Compensation and Minimized Cross-Regulation}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={49}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1242-1255}, 
abstract={Slow load transient response and potential cross-regulation effect are two major performance barriers for single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) power converters. To overcome these barriers, this paper presents a parallel-structured hybrid SIMO power converter with an adaptive current compensation (ACC) technique. With the employment of new and compact linear regulators, the proposed ACC technique improves both the step-up/down transient responses significantly without the needs on advanced controls or high switching frequency. The interactive duty ratio changes between sub-converters are also avoided due to the fast recovery during load transition periods. Cross-regulation effect is thus minimized. The SIMO power converter is fabricated with 0.35 μm CMOS process. The input voltage is 3 V and two output voltages are regulated at 1.8 V and 1.2 V, respectively, with a switching frequency of 500 kHz. The peak efficiency is measured at 82.8% with 102-mW load power. A 50.3-ns transient response time is achieved with 270-mW load change. No observable cross-regulation is found during load transient measurements.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the signaling and digital power overhead of pre-emphasis voltage-mode transmitters. Utilizing a shunt branch in parallel with the differential channel to implement pre-emphasis is shown to have the best overall energy-efficiency. Leveraging this technique, an efficient pre-emphasis voltage mode transmitter architecture with output amplitude control, pre-emphasis coefficient control, and online impedance calibration is proposed and demonstrated. A 65 nm LP CMOS implementation of this architecture dissipates ~ 10 mW from a 1.2 V supply when transmitting 10 Gb/s 200 mV differential amplitude data with 2-tap pre-emphasis, achieving 1 pJ/bit energy efficiency.},

abstract={A 45 GHz active phase-shift Doherty PA is proposed and implemented in 45-nm SOI CMOS. The quarter wave-length transmission line at the input of the auxiliary amplifier is replaced by an amplifier, increasing the gain and PAE by more than 1 dB and 5%, while reducing the die area. Use of slow-wave coplanar waveguides (S-CPW) improves the PAE and gain by approximately 3% and 1 dB, and further reduces the die area. Two-stack FET amplifiers are used as the main and auxiliary amplifiers, allowing a supply voltage of 2.5 V and increasing the output power. The active phase-shift Doherty amplifier demonstrates a peak power gain and PAE of 8 dB and 20% at 45 GHz. It occupies 0.45 mm2, and at 6-dB back-off power, the PAE is 21%.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={12}, 
pages={2977-2988}, 
abstract={In today's fully-integrated converters, the integrated LC components dominate the chip-area and have become the major limitation of reducing the cost and increasing the current density. This paper presents a 100 MHz four-phase fully-integrated buck converter with standard package bondwire inductors and a flying capacitor (CFLY) topology for chip-area reduction, occupying 1.25 mm2 effective area in 0.13-Î¼m CMOS technology. A four-phase operation is introduced for chip-area reduction with the cost penalty minimized by utilizing standard package bondwire inductance as power inductors. Meanwhile, an extra more than 40% chip-area saving is achieved by the simple but effective CFLY topology to take advantage of the parasitic bondwire inductance at the input for ripple attenuation. A maximum output current of 1.2 A is obtained by the four-phase operation, while only 3.73 nF overall integrated capacitors are required. Also, with the chip-area hungry integrated spiral metal inductors eliminated, the current density is significantly increased. 0.96 A/mm2 current density and 82.4% efficiency is obtained with 1.2 V to 0.9 V voltage conversion without using any off-chip inductors or advanced processes. The reliability is also verified by measurement with various bondwire inductances and configurations.},

pages={1511-1520}, 
abstract={A 1 Mb nonvolatile embedded memory using a four transistor and two spin-transfer-torque (STT) magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) cell is designed and fabricated to demonstrate its zero standby power and high performance. The power supply voltages of 32 cells along a word line (WL) are controlled simultaneously by a power line (PL) driver to eliminate the standby power without impact on the access time. This fine-grained power gating scheme also optimizes the trade-off between macro size and operation power. The butterfly curve for the cell is measured to be asymmetric as predicted, enhancing the cell's static noise margin (SNM) for data retention. The scaling of 1 Mb macro size is compared with that of the 6T SRAM counterpart, indicating that the former will become smaller than the latter at 45 nm technology node and beyond by moderately thinning its tunnel dielectrics (MgO) in accordance with the shrink of the MTJ's cross sectional area. The operation current of the macro is also shown to be almost unchanged over generations, while that of the 6T SRAM increases exponentially due to the degradation of MOSFET off-current as the device scales.},

abstract={This paper presents a power- and area-efficient 24-way time-interleaved successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that achieves 2.8 GS/s and 8.1 ENOB in 65 nm CMOS. To minimize the power and the area, the capacitors in the capacitive DAC are sized to meet the thermal noise requirements rather than the matching requirements, leading to the LSB capacitance of 50 aF. An on-chip digital background calibration is used to calibrate the capacitor mismatches in individual ADC channels, as well as the inter-channel offset, gain and timing mismatches. Measurement results at the 2.8 GS/s sampling rate show that the ADC chip prototype consumes 44.6 mW of power from a 1.2 V supply while achieving peak SNDR of 50.9 dB and retaining SNDR higher than 48.2 dB across the entire first Nyquist zone with a 1.8Vpp-diff input signal. The prototype chip occupies an area of 1.03 Ã 1.66 mm2, including the pads and the testing circuits. The figure of merit (FoM) of this ADC, calculated with the minimum SNDR in the first Nyquist zone, is 76 fJ/conversion-step.},

abstract={A power-efficient wireless stimulating system for a head-mounted deep brain stimulator (DBS) is presented. A new adaptive rectifier generates a variable DC supply voltage from a constant AC power carrier utilizing phase control feedback, while achieving high AC-DC power conversion efficiency (PCE) through active synchronous switching. A current-controlled stimulator adopts closed-loop supply control to automatically adjust the stimulation compliance voltage by detecting stimulation site potentials through a voltage readout channel, and improve the stimulation efficiency. The stimulator also utilizes closed-loop active charge balancing to maintain the residual charge at each site within a safe limit, while receiving the stimulation parameters wirelessly from the amplitude-shift-keyed power carrier. A 4-ch wireless stimulating system prototype was fabricated in a 0.5-Î¼m 3M2P standard CMOS process, occupying 2.25 mm2. With 5 V peak AC input at 2 MHz, the adaptive rectifier provides an adjustable DC output between 2.5 V and 4.6 V at 2.8 mA loading, resulting in measured PCE of 72 ~ 87%. The adaptive supply control increases the stimulation efficiency up to 30% higher than a fixed supply voltage to 58 ~ 68%. The prototype wireless stimulating system was verified in vitro.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48},

pages={1416-1428}, 
abstract={A highly-digital clock multiplication architecture that achieves excellent jitter and mitigates supply noise is presented. The proposed architecture utilizes a calibration-free digital multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) to decouple the tradeoff between time-to-digital converter (TDC) resolution and oscillator phase noise in digital phase-locked loops (PLLs). Both reduction in jitter accumulation down to sub-picosecond levels and improved supply noise rejection over conventional PLL architectures is demonstrated with low power consumption. A digital PLL that employs a 1-bit TDC and a low power regulator that seeks to improve supply noise immunity without increasing loop delay is presented and used to compare with the proposed MDLL. The prototype MDLL and DPLL chips are fabricated in a 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology and operate from a nominal 1.1 V supply. The proposed MDLL achieves an integrated jitter of 400 fs rms at 1.5 GHz output frequency from a 375 MHz reference clock, while consuming 890 Î¼ W. The worst-case supply noise sensitivity of the MDLL is 20 fspp/mVpp which translates to a jitter degradation of 3.8 ps in the presence of 200 mV supply noise. The proposed clock multipliers occupy active die areas of 0.25 mm2 and 0.2 mm2 for the MDLL and DPLL, respectively.},

abstract={Integrated circuits for wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) targeting the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm require ultralow-power consumption for energy-harvesting operation and low die area for low-cost nodes. As the IoT calls for the deployment of trillions of WSNs, minimizing the carbon footprint for WSN chip manufacturing further emerges as a third target in a design-for-the-environment (DfE) perspective. The SleepWalker microcontroller is a 65-nm ultralow-voltage SoC based on the MSP430 architecture capable of delivering increased speed performances at 25 MHz for only 7 Î¼W/MHz at 0.4 V. Its sub-mm2 die area with low external component requirement ensures a low carbon footprint for chip manufacturing. SleepWalker incorporates an on-chip adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) system with DC/DC converter, clock generator, memories, sensor and communication interfaces, making it suited for WSN applications. An LP/GP process mix is fully exploited for minimizing the energy per cycle, with power gating to keep stand-by power at 1.7 Î¼W. By incorporating a glitch-masking instruction cache, system power can be reduced by up to 52%. The AVS system ensures proper 25-MHz operation over process and temperature variations from -40 Â°C to +85 Â°C, with a peak efficiency of the DC/DC converter above 80%. Finally, a multi-Vt clock tree reduces variability-induced clock skew by 3 Ã to ensure robust timing closure down to 0.3 V.},

abstract={A 2.8-3.2-GHz fractional-N digital PLL, implemented in 0.18- Î¼m CMOS, is presented. The PLL architecture has the form of a classic delta-sigma fractional-N PLL. A PFD generates up and down pulses from the reference and divided-down digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) clock. The time-to-digital converter (TDC) converts the width of up pulses to digital words. The quantization noise introduced by a third-order delta-sigma modulator through the multi-modulus divider is canceled at the TDC output. A resistively interpolated ADC is employed to boost TDC resolution by a factor of five. A dither-less DCO with an inductively coupled fine-tuned varactor bank improves tuning step-size by a factor of 16.6, to 20 kHz. With a 52-MHz reference clock, a 3.2-GHz output clock, and a loop-bandwidth of 950 kHz, this prototype achieves 230-fs rms jitter, integrated from a 1-kHz to 40-MHz offset, while drawing 17 mW from a 1.8-V supply. The in-band phase noise floor is -111.6 dBc/Hz at a 500-kHz offset. The reference spur is -75 dBc and the worst-case fractional-N spur, by sweeping the multiplication ratio near 61, is -55 dBc. An FOM of -240.4 dB is achieved, and this design occupies a core area of 0.62 mm2 .},

The transmitted power via the RWPT with the 3R ranges from 0 W to 6 W, and its peak efficiency reaches 86%. It employs the Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) for different output power levels. This helps to increase the output power and to lower the voltage stress on the transistor. Fabricated in 0.35 Î¼m BCD technology, the 3R circuit occupies an area of 2.35Ã2.35 mm2.

Finally, a novel successive-approximation algorithm is proposed to perform automatic phase detection and tuning.

Compared with the commonly used class-B/C architectures, the optimal class-D oscillator produces less phase noise for the same power consumption, at the expense of a higher power supply pushing. A prototype of a class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) targeted for mobile applications, implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process, covers a 46% tuning range between 3.0 and 4.8 GHz; drawing 10 mA from 0.4 V, the phase noise at 10-MHz offset from 4.8 GHz is -143.5 dBc/Hz, for an FoM of 191 dBc/Hz with less than 1-dB variation across the tuning range.

abstract={The availability of wide-band low-power frequency dividers is fundamental in transceivers for emerging mm-wave applications. Up to date injection locked topologies have been investigated for very high frequency operations but at the price of large area and limited frequency range. In this work, we investigate a new class based on dynamic latches with load modulation. The proposed latches can be viewed as the evolution of classic static CML latches where the regenerative cross-coupled pair is removed for minimum parasitic at output nodes, i.e., maximum speed, and loads are modulated by the input clock for maximum charge retention during hold times. A time-domain circuit inspection aimed at deriving analytical expressions for maximum and minimum operation frequency and providing guidelines for optimum design is reported. Prototypes of dividers by 4, realized in 32 nm bulk CMOS, operate between 14 GHz and 70 GHz, demonstrating a fractional bandwidth in excess of 60% in the entire range, 4.8 mW of maximum power consumption and 55 Ã18 Î¼m2 occupied area.},

abstract={This paper introduces extended correlated double sampling (ECDS) as a new gain-calibration technique in pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The proposed calibration simultaneously improves the effective dc gain and increases the maximum output swing of the opamps with given overdrive voltages. Furthermore, ECDS is immediate, thus avoiding the long convergence time associated with many background calibration schemes. This characteristic makes it desirable for applications where the ADC is on only briefly, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). An 11-bit 40-MS/s prototype pipelined ADC has been fabricated in 0.25-Î¼m CMOS to demonstrate the proposed calibration technique. The active die area is 3.8 mm2 , and the analog power dissipation is 85 mW from a 2.5-V supply. With a 72-kHz input frequency, ECDS improves signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio from 40.1 to 63.4 dB and spurious-free dynamic range from 41.8 to 75.7 dB.},

An improved model is introduced for direct-injection ILFDs, based on which both the phase and gain conditions are analyzed and discussed. Moreover, a method of admittance locus is applied to obtain the design intuition for optimization and to predict the locking range accurately. Finally, with the proposed model and design methodology, a frequency-tracking ILFD is designed and fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, which measures a locking range of 39.2% from 53.4 to 79.4 GHz while consuming 2.9 mW from an 0.8-V power supply, which corresponds to an FoM of 8.97 GHz/mW.},

abstract={This paper presents a closed-loop accelerometer interface based on a force-feedback ÎÎ£ loop. The interface reduces the offset, and its drift, arising from asymmetry in the parasitic capacitances of the bondwires connecting the CMOS interface IC and the MEMS sensor element. This is achieved by modulating the spring constant of the sensor electrostatically and continuously measuring and nulling the offset via an offset cancellation loop. In a bondwire deformation experiment, we show that the offset cancellation loop reduces an induced offset of 350 mg by 54 dB down to 0.7 mg. The interface was fabricated in a 0.18-Î¼m CMOS technology. The active circuit area is 1.35 mm2 and the interface consumes 3.1 mW from a 3-V supply, while achieving a noise floor of 220 Î¼g/âHz over a 1-kHz bandwidth. When the offset cancellation loop is turned on the bandwidth available for the signal is 200 Hz.},

volume={48},

pages={1970-1985}, 
abstract={In this paper, a unified media application processor (UMAP) is presented for 2D/3D image analysis/synthesis applications on handheld devices. UMAP integrates parallel and sequential processing layers which consist of heterogeneous functional IPs for general media contents processing on today's application processors (AP). Based on the heterogeneous many-core platform, UMAP supports not only graphics and vision processing for real-time augmented reality (AR) but also disparity estimation and 3D display synthesis for 3D-view AR acceleration. A new concept of 3D-view AR which synthesizes 3D display contents from two vertically aligned stereo images and a self-constructed disparity map is introduced to achieve true realism for next generation mobile devices. For low-cost 3D-view AR processing, a homography-based disparity estimation (HDE) algorithm is proposed to construct a disparity map between two stereo images with small implementation overhead. For real-time and energy-efficient system organization, workload-balanced 3-stage pipelined architecture and a mixed-mode feature extraction engine (FEE) are also implemented in UMAP. The 3-stage pipelined system which consists of graphics, vision, and display operation stages reduces per-frame execution latency, while dynamic analog/digital mode reconfiguration based on mixed-mode FEE reduces per-frame energy dissipation, so real-time energy-efficient 3D-view AR can be realized in UMAP. FEE performs high-speed corner detection for vision processing based on four pairs of analog current contention logics (CCLs). Especially, a diode-connected current sensing stabilizer (CSS) in each CCL reduces minimum sensing current for corner detection, so average power consumed in CCL is reduced by 44.9%. In 2D or 3D-view AR processing, FEE with four CCLs replaces the parallel processing core cluster which is the most power hungry IP in UMAP, so 96.7% of cluster power and 99.1% of target detection time are saved in real operation. Based- on the 3-stage pipelined architecture with the dynamic mode reconfiguration technique, the entire UMAP achieves up to 64.4% of energy reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art media processors in full operation.},

pages={2839-2849}, 
abstract={Wireless microsystems like biomedical implants and embedded sensors derive energy from tiny in-package sources that, unfortunately, exhaust easily, which means that operational life is short. Periodically coupling power wirelessly is one way of replenishing onboard batteries, except that small receiver coils suffer from low coupling factors kC and induce low electromotive-force voltages. Today, receivers store and resonate incoming energy between the receiving coil and an off-chip capacitor until the voltage rises sufficiently high for a diode-bridge rectifier to steer power into a battery. The capacitor, however, requires board space and constrains the source to a particular frequency. The 180-nm CMOS power receiver presented in this paper removes the diode bridge, which establishes a minimum voltage below which the system cannot derive power, so that neither tuning nor a resonating capacitor is necessary. Experimental measurements show that the system draws power from 30-mV signals when kC is 0.0046 and coil separation is 11.35 mm, and this threshold voltage only changes 13.6 mV across 100-150 kHz, which is a 27.1% lower threshold voltage that is 36 Ã less sensitive than its resonating counterpart. The peak efficiency of the receiver when rectifying to 1.2 V is 82% at 224 Î¼W and 125 kHz and average efficiency is 76% for 90-386-mV coil voltages.},

abstract={Low voltage SRAM at a near-threshold voltage has two major sources of power waste: excess bit line swing due to the random variation of transistors and dynamic power consumption of the bit line swing of non-selected columns. In order to overcome these waste power consumption issues and achieve the highest energy-efficient operation of low voltage SRAM, the new CSHBL technique and CCC techniques, which is the improved version of the CSHBL, have been proposed. An SRAM fabricated using 65 nm technology adopting the CSHBL achieved an energy consumption of 26.4 pJ/Access/Mbit, and that of 13.8 pJ/Acess/Mbit is achieved by the SRAM macro that adopted CCC with 40 nm technology. This energy consumption is lower than values in previous works.},

abstract={Flicker noise up-conversion in voltage-biased oscillators can be effectively suppressed by inserting resistances in series to the drain of the transconductor MOSFETs. This solution avoids the degradation of the start-up margin and the adoption of area-demanding resonant filters with proper tuning. This paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis of 1/f noise up-conversion and quantitatively addresses the impact of two major contributions, namely the Groszkowski effect and the loop delay caused by stray capacitances at the drain node of the transistors. A simple flow for the design of an oscillator with suppressed flicker noise up-conversion is presented which is based on first-order closed-form formulas. Finally , theoretical estimates are compared to experimental results on a 65-nm CMOS VCO covering the 3.0-3.6 GHz band.},

A neuro-fuzzy controller is proposed to manage the mixed-mode operations as a host processor while reducing extra processing delay and power consumption on inter-domain communications. To solve the conventional problems of a large dimensional mixed-mode VLSI system such as throughput degradation due to long channel delay, limited functionality of fixed analog circuits, and mismatches from process variation, the proposed processor adopts 2-stage asynchronous mixed-mode pipeline, flexible channel configuration of each domain, and learning-based calibration technologies respectively.

abstract={Visual prostheses with a high number of electrodes are now of great research interest driven by the successful recent clinical trials. High channel devices are confronted with numerous challenges many of which can be addressed by adopting a multi-implant architecture. However now the difficulties lie in ensuring safety of the inter-implant interface by addressing the associated risks, often neglected in the past. This paper presents a multi-implant architecture-based 98-channel neurostimulator with an inter-implant interface consisting only of two wires, carrying both power and semi-duplex data. The interface is ac-coupled both to prevent high levels of dc current in the presence of insulation failures and to maintain a charge-balanced interface. The interface is also monitored within the stimulator itself for added means of safety. The stimulator is fabricated using a 0.35-Î¼m HVCMOS technology and occupies 4.9 Ã 4.9 mm2 without any external discrete components, making it suitable for a chip-scale packaging.},

abstract={A low power sub-sampling multi-channel 2.4-GHz receiver front-end is presented. Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) resonators which intrinsically exhibit high quality factor (Q) are exploited in the frequency synthesis to provide low phase noise signal with low power consumption. A low power solution to perform channel selection and filtering directly at RF by employing current reuse and using a BAW resonator is proposed. The filter is capable of tuning the bandwidth and thus making the front-end to be suitable for multi-band/multi-standard applications. The overall performance of the front-end is improved by additional discrete time filtering which also down-converts the wanted channel to baseband in quadrature. The proposed front-end is designed and integrated in a 0.18-Î¼m CMOS process. Measurements reveal that the front-end is capable of providing very narrow band filtering down to 300 kHz. The rejection at 10-MHz offset is 62 dB with conversion gain of 44.2 dB.},

Measurements show two-dimensional pattern scanning capabilities with a directivity of 17.0 dB, an array gain of ~26.5 dB at 110 GHz, and an EIRP of 23-25 dBm at 108-114 GHz.

abstract={A 1.2 V 4 Gb DDR4 SDRAM is presented in a 30 nm CMOS technology. DDR4 SDRAM is developed to raise memory bandwidth with lower power consumption compared with DDR3 SDRAM. Various functions and circuit techniques are newly adopted to reduce power consumption and secure stable transaction. First, dual error detection scheme is proposed to guarantee the reliability of signals. It is composed of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for DQ channel and command-address (CA) parity for command and address channel. For stable reception of high speed signals, a gain enhanced buffer and PVT tolerant data fetch scheme are adopted for CA and DQ respectively. To reduce the output jitter, the type of delay line is selected depending on data rate at initial stage. As a result, test measurement shows 3.3 Gb/s DDR operation at 1.14 V.},

title={An 86 mW 98GOPS ANN-Searching Processor for Full-HD 30 fps Video Object Recognition With Zeroless Locality-Sensitive Hashing}, 
year={2013},

pages={1615-1624}, 
abstract={Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching is an essential task in object recognition. The ANN-searching stage, however, is the main bottleneck in the object recognition process due to increasing database size and massive dimensions of keypoint descriptors. In this paper, a high throughput ANN-searching processor is proposed for high-resolution (full-HD) and real-time (30 fps) video object recognition. The proposed ANN-searching processor adopts an interframe cache architecture as a hardware-oriented approach and a zeroless locality-sensitive-hashing (zeroless-LSH) algorithm as a software-oriented approach to reduce the external memory bandwidth required in nearest neighbor searching. A four-way set associative on-chip cache has a dedicated architecture to exploit data correlation at the frame-level. Zeroless-LSH minimizes data transactions from external memory at the vector-level. The proposed ANN-searching processor is fabricated as part of an object recognition SoC using a 0.13 Î¼m 6 metal CMOS technology. It achieves 62 720 vectors/s throughput and 1140 GOPS/W power efficiency, which are 1.45 and 1.37 times higher than the state-of-the-art, respectively, enabling real-time object recognition for full-HD 30 fps video streams.},

year={2013},

number={4}, 
pages={907-916}, 
abstract={An all-digital dynamically adaptive clock distribution mitigates the impact of high-frequency supply voltage (VCC) droops on microprocessor performance and energy efficiency. The design integrates a tunable-length delay prior to the global clock distribution to prolong the clock-data delay compensation in critical paths during a VCC droop. The tunable-length delay prevents critical-path timing-margin degradation for multiple cycles after the VCC droop occurs, thus allowing a sufficient response time for dynamic adaptation. An on-die dynamic variation monitor detects the onset of the VCC droop to proactively gate the clock at the end of the tunable-length delay to eliminate the clock edges that would otherwise degrade critical-path timing margin. In comparison to a conventional clock distribution, silicon measurements from a 22 nm test chip demonstrate simultaneous throughput gains and energy reductions of 14% and 3% at 1.0 V, 18% and 5% at 0.8 V, and 31% and 15% at 0.6 V, respectively, for a 10% VCC droop.},

abstract={This paper introduces a single-photon detection technique for time-of-flight distance ranging based on the temporal and spatial correlation of photons. A proof-of-concept prototype achieving depth imaging up to 100 meters with a resolution of 340 Ã 96 pixels at 10 frames/s was implemented. At the core of the system, a sensor chip comprising 32 macro-pixels based on an array of single-photon avalanche diodes featuring an optical fill factor of 70% was fabricated in a 0.18-Î¼m CMOS. The chip also comprises an array of 32 circuits capable of generating precise triggers upon correlation events as well as of sampling the number of photons involved in each correlation event, and an array of 32 12-b time-to-digital converters. Characterization of the TDC array led to -0.52 LSB and 0.73 LSB of differential and integral nonlinearities, respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the TOF sensor under strong solar background light, i.e., 80 klux, revealed a repeatability error better than 10 cm throughout the distance range of 100 m, thus leading to a relative precision of 0.1%. In the same condition, the relative nonlinearity error was 0.37%. In order to show the suitability of our approach in a real-world situation, experimental results in which the depth sensor was operated in a typical traffic scenario are also reported.},

abstract={A discrete-time audio ÎÎ£ modulator for a MEMS microphone with digital output is presented that features a scalable signal bandwidth to also support ultrasonic frequencies for proximity sensing applications such as gesture recognition. The modulator achieves low power consumption and a small die area by using simple digital inverter instead of OTAs. To increase the robustness of the inverter approach, an LDO is used to provide an internally generated supply which regulates the inverter bias point. The LDO also improves the power supply rejection of the pseudo-differential architecture to above 78 dB. The presented ÎÎ£ modulator supports a scalable signal bandwidth up to 100 kHz, by dynamically adjusting the internal supply voltage depending on the sampling frequency. In the nominal 20-kHz audio band, it dissipates 140 Î¼W from a minimum 1.5-V supply and achieves a DR of 92.6 dB , a SNDR of 87.9 dB, and a THD of -102.7 dB, respectively.},

abstract={N-path switched-RC circuits can realize filters with very high linearity and compression point while they are tunable by a clock frequency. In this paper, both differential and single-ended N-path notch filters are modeled and analyzed. Closed-form equations provide design equations for the main filtering characteristics and nonidealities such as: harmonic mixing, switch resistance, mismatch and phase imbalance, clock rise and fall times, noise, and insertion loss. Both an eight-path single-ended and differential notch filter are implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology. The notch center frequency, which is determined by the switching frequency, is tunable from 0.1 to 1.2 GHz. In a 50-Î© environment, the N-path filters provide power matching in the passband with an insertion loss of 1.4-2.8 dB.

abstract={This paper presents a method to rapidly estimate the read and write stability of cells within an SRAM array without modifying the cell structure. The approach measures the read or write bit-line current for a few supply levels and apply the measurements to an estimation function to determine the read stability and write ability of the cell. The estimation function can be determined by regression using stability measurements for a subset of the memory. A low-area sensing circuit and an on-chip time-based ADC measures the bit-line current. The step size of the supply voltage for estimating the stability is 100 mV and for determining the estimation function is 25 mV with an accuracy of Â±1 mV. Measurement data show that the estimation error sigma is as small as 4.77% for the read stability and 1.3% for the write ability estimation. The validity of the approach is verified in measurements across multiple dice from a test chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2827-2838}, 
abstract={A configurable-bandwidth charge-domain filter (CDF) with bandwidth calibration and clock-pulse modulation (CPM) is proposed. The bandwidth calibration scheme controls the insertion loss at a pre-specified frequency by modulating the feedback gain and delay; this helps the CDF to suppress the sinc distortion and thus achieve near-ideal brick-wall filtering. For multi-frequency compensation, a multi-stage CDF architecture is utilized to organize the feedback delay. Together with non-decimation filtering, the noise folding effect as well as the chip area can be reduced. On the other hand, to provide a stable gain under variable channel bandwidth, a CPM scheme is proposed; it adjusts the clock period with a fixed pulse width by zero-insertion. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS technology, the proposed CDF achieves 58.9-dB adjacent-channel rejection (ACR), 85.5-dB stop-band attenuation (SBA), 41-dB conversion gain, and 19.5-MHz channel bandwidth at 320-MS/s input-sampling rate. Furthermore, for input-sampling rates range from 300 to 480 MS/s, the channel bandwidth can be configured from 5 to 26 MHz. At 1.2-V supply, the chip consumes 8.4-mW power and occupies 0.52-mm2 area.},

abstract={We propose low-leakage current embedded SRAMs with high-performance for mobile applications. The proposed SRAM has two standby modes depending on temperature; one is a low-voltage resume-standby mode to reduce the standby current (ISTBY) more effectively at room temperature, and the other is the conventional resume-standby to reduce ISTBY effectively at high temperature. These schemes are implemented in a single SRAM macro with an all-digital current comparator (ADCC) that chooses either mode by monitoring ISTBY automatically. ADCC has a time to digital converter (TDC) which is suitable for leakage measurement. Moreover, the proposed monitoring sequence can compensate the error of the measurement caused by the variation of the MOSFETs. A test chip was fabricated using 28 nm HKMG CMOS technology. The proposed 32 kb SRAM achieves 0.41 Î¼A standby leakage which is half of the conventional value. This SRAM also realizes a high-speed operation with an access time of 420 ps.},

abstract={High-speed signaling over high density interconnect on organic package substrates or silicon interposers offers an attractive solution to the off-chip bandwidth limitation problem faced in modern digital systems. In this paper, we describe a signaling system co-designed with the interconnect to take advantage of the characteristics of this environment to enable a high-speed, low area, and low-power die to die link. Ground-Referenced Signaling (GRS) is a single-ended signaling system that eliminates the major problems traditionally associated with single-ended design by using the ground plane as the reference and signaling above and below ground. This design employs a novel charge pump driver that additionally eliminates the issue of simultaneous switching noise with data independent current consumption. Silicon measurements from a test chip implementing two 16-lane links, with forwarded clocks, in a standard 28 nm process demonstrate 20 Gb/s operation at 0.54 pJ/bit over 4.5 mm organic substrate channels at a nominal 0.9 V power supply voltage. Timing margins at the receiver are >0.3 UI at a BER of 10-12. We estimate BER 10-25 at the eye center.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={2}, 
pages={465-472}, 
abstract={A class-D amplifier with pulse code modulated (PCM) digital input is developed for a low-power digital hearing aid. A 16-bit 40-kbps PCM digital input is noise-shaped by a third-order digital sigma-delta modulator (SDM) which provides 1.5-bit digital output. The 1.5-bit digital output of the digital SDM is converted to a three-level analog signal by a simple digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and then applied to an analog SDM. The analog SDM provides pulse density modulated (PDM) signal to drive a power switch. The PDM output is fed back to the input of the analog SDM in order to suppress the noise of the power switch. While the integrators of the analog SDM are implemented with switched-capacitor (SC) circuits for a well-defined frequency response of the modulator loop filter, the feedback path from the power switch output is realized with a continuous-time (CT) integrator for effective noise suppression. The class-D amplifier with PCM digital input has been implemented in a standard 0.13-Î¼m CMOS process. With 160-Î© load of speaker, the maximum output power delivered to the load is 1.14-mW while the efficiency of the power switch is 97-%. The signalmathchar"702D tomathchar"702D noise+distortion&nbsp;ratio (SNDR) and dynamic range (DR) of the class-D amplifier are measured to be 80.6-dB and 87-dB, respectively. The class-D amplifier consumes 0.38-mW from a 1.2-V power supply including the driving power of the power switch.},

abstract={A harmonic rejection mixer (HRM) with a programmable local oscillator (LO) frequency is presented. The design allows for the generation of multiple effective LO frequencies within a single HRM that are derived from a single primary clock frequency, without any modifications to the analog signal path. A 16-phase HRM with the proposed frequency synthesis technique is implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process. A clocking approach within a two-stage HRM is presented, which reduces HRM sensitivity to both gain and phase mismatch. The HRM synthesizes eight effective LO frequencies and shows an 11.9-dB gain, 11.2-dB DSB NF, and +5.4-dBm in-band IIP3 in the fundamental mode. Greater than 72-dB HR3, 71-dB HR5, and 67-dB HR7 is achieved over ten IC samples in this mode without calibration or harmonic filtering. Harmonic rejection greater than 61 dB for LO factors 2-6 and 54 dB for LO factor 7 is observed, when modifying the effective LO frequency. The HRM achieves S11 better than -10 dB over 50-830 MHz and has a total power consumption of 67 mW from a 1.2-V supply.},

Enhancements relative to the first-generation version include digitally background-calibrated open-loop V / I conversion in the VCRO to increase ADC bandwidth and enable operation from a single low-voltage power supply, quadrature coupled ring oscillators to reduce quantization noise, digital over-range correction to improve dynamic range and enable graceful overload behavior, and various circuit-level improvements. The ADC occupies 0.075 mm2 in a 65 nm CMOS process and operates from a single 0.9-1.2 V supply. Its sample-rate is tunable from 1.3 to 2.4 GHz over which the SNDR spans 70-75 dB, the bandwidth spans 5-37.5 MHz, and the minimum SNDR+ 10log(bandwidth/power dissipation) figure of merit (FOM) is 160 dB.},

abstract={In this paper, a new second-order discrete-time ÎÎ£ ADC using a noise-shaped two-step integrating quantizer is presented. The first quantization step (coarse) is utilized with a flash ADC.

High quantization resolution enhances the modulator stability whereas the extra order of noise-shaping improves the overall performance. The proposed ÎÎ£ ADC incorporating the noise-shaped two-step integrating quantizer manifests a second-order noise-shaping with a first-order loop filter. To accommodate the large number of quantization levels of the feedback-DAC, a new feedback topology is presented which uses both analog and digital signals.

abstract={In this paper, harmonic rejection (HR) mixing techniques to obtain a high level of HR are described. This is achieved by reducing the sensitivity to mismatches in devices operating at high frequencies. A design fabricated in a 110-nm CMOS process rejects up to the first 14 local oscillator (LO) harmonics and achieves third, fifth, and seventh HR ratios in excess of 52, 54, and 55 dB, respectively, without any calibration or trimming. This mixer also rejects flicker noise and has improved quadrature matching and IIP2 performance. By using a clock N times the desired LO frequency, this scheme rejects the (N-1)th LO harmonic only by an amount of 20log(N-1) dB. A new technique is presented that enables better HR for the (N-1)th harmonic while preserving the level of rejection for other harmonics. This mixer fabricated in a 55-nm standard CMOS process has a programmable number of 8, 10, 12, or 14 mixer phases and achieves an improvement of 29 dB for the (N-1)th harmonic while achieving 52 dB of rejection for the third harmonic.

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2442-2456}, 
abstract={An integrated fixed-frequency adaptive-on-time (AOT) DC-DC converter with fast transient response and enhanced high light-load efficiency is presented. At both Continuous-Conduction-Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous-Conduction-Mode (DCM) operation, the on-time is adaptively controlled by a frequency locked loop so that the switching frequency tracks the reference frequency with less than Â±0.5% error in the whole operating range. At CCM operation, the reference frequency is fixed at 1 MHz. At light load with DCM operation, the reference frequency hops between 1 MHz and 1 MHz/N where N = 2 i and i = 1 to 5 according to the loads without load current sensor. Frequency hopping is introduced to boost the efficiency as well as reduce the EMI noise problem. A glitch-free on-time control circuit is introduced to increase the track accuracy and speed of the frequency locked loop. A mode decision circuit with digital hysteretic window is used to ensure a smooth transition between CCM and DCM operation. An on-time generator with proper logics is used to suppress frequency bouncing during frequency hopping. A prototype with 1.8 V-3.2 V input voltage, 3.0 V-4.2 V output voltage and 0 mA-800 mA load current range has been fabricated in a 0.35 Î¼m 2P4M CMOS process. Load transient measurements verify that 8 Î¼s-20 Î¼s recovery time is achieved for load current increase. Measurement results also show a maximum efficiency of 94.8% is achieved at total output power of 3.269 W, and the light load efficiency is enhanced by the proposed frequency hopping technique with a predictable noise spectrum.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={2}, 
pages={487-501}, 
abstract={A novel low power compact loop filter using a single amplifier biquad (SAB) network is presented for continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma (ÎÎ£) modulators. This new technique reduces power consumption and die area by minimizing the number of active elements and simplifying the modulator topology. The new SAB network has a transfer function (TF) zero, which implements a local feedforward (FF) path in system-level diagram. By having a local FF branch embedded in the SAB network, the FF branches to the summing block in the SAB based feedforward modulator topology is reduced to half the number of FF branches in the conventional topology. Consequently, the SAB based modulator utilizes a switch-capacitor (SC) adder replacing the commonly used CT adder and the sample & hold blocks in the conventional architecture. The SAB based loop filter with reduced FF branches simplifies the design and implementation of the high-order continuous-time ÎÎ£ modulator. The proposed loop filter is a general filter, which can be used for both high and low oversampling ratios (OSRs). A 4th-order low pass continuous-time ÎÎ£ modulator is designed and implemented in 130 nm process to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Within a 7.2 MHz signal bandwidth, the measured dynamic range and SFDR of this prototype IC are 80 dB and 83.1 dB, respectively, and the total power consumption of 13.7 mW.},

year={2013},

pages={1302-1314}, 
abstract={Embedded flash memory implemented using standard I/O devices can open doors to new applications and system capabilities, as it can serve as a secure on-chip non-volatile storage for VLSI chips built in standard logic processes. For example, it is indispensable for adaptive self-healing techniques targeted for mitigating process variation and circuit aging related issues where system information must be retained during power down periods. Embedded non-volatile memory can also enable zero-standby power systems by allowing them to completely power down without losing critical data. There has been numerous device and circuit level research on high-density non-volatile memories such as flash, STT-MRAM, PRAM, and RRAM. However, only few attempts have been made to develop a cost effective moderate-density non-volatile solution using standard I/O devices. In this paper, a logic-compatible embedded flash memory that uses no special devices other than standard core and I/O transistors is demonstrated in a generic logic process having a 5 nm tunnel oxide. An overstress-free high voltage switch and a selective WL refresh scheme are employed for improved cell threshold voltage window and higher endurance cycles.},

abstract={Flying-Adder direct period synthesis is a technology that directly constructs output clock period from a known base time unit Î. In the past, it is mainly used for driving digital load. In this work, a new scheme is proposed to produce spectrally pure clock signal at certain frequencies which can be used to drive devices such as SoC on-chip ADC, DAC and etc. This scheme utilizes a Flying-Adder synthesizer as a fractional divider placed inside the PLL loop. Additionally, a PDFR technique is used to help improve the frequency resolution. Moreover, a unique accumulator is used to boost circuit speed. A 55 nm implementation is fabricated and is used to validate the architecture of this 2nd generation Flying-Adder PLL. The resolution of this enhanced integer-N PLL is 1.5 MHz across the entire VCO operating range with a 12 MHz input and loop bandwidth of 1 MHz. The power consumed is 8.3 mW at 2.3 GHz and the area is 0.16 mm2 . The significance of this fractional divider is discussed at the end. A brief comparison between this clock generator and others is given at the end as well.},

The cores operate over a supply voltage range from 200 mV (best samples) to 1.2 V with clock frequencies from 10 kHz to 94 MHz at room temperature. The lowest energy consumption per cycle of 9.94 pJ is observed at 325 mV and 133 kHz.

abstract={Among the stacked dies using through silicon via (TSV), data conflictions occur due to process mismatches, which decrease the data valid window and consume unwanted power due to the short circuit current. This paper presents the DLL-based data self-aligner (DBDA), which reduces data conflictions among stacked dies. The stacked dies employing the proposed DBDAs automatically align their data output timings without relying on any control signals from the master die or an extra signal among the stacked die. The DBDA reduces the data confliction time (tDC) due to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations from 500 ps to 50 ps and thereby reduces the short current from 3.62 mA to 0.41 mA. The proposed DBDA has two operation modes: the synchronous self-align mode (SSAM), in which the data is aligned in the external clock domain and the asynchronous self-align mode (ASAM). The lock time of DBDA is less than 20 cycles in SSAM. Additionally, the lock detector (LD) and proposed re-calibrator help the DBDA to find the optimal calibration period under temperature variation. They also reduce the calibration current of DBDA by 45.5%. A prototype DBDA implemented in 130 nm CMOS technology dissipates 247 Î¼W for 800 Mb/s/pin. For reduction of the leakage current during the power down mode or the self-refresh mode, this paper proposes a leakage current controller, which reduces the leakage power by 90.5%.},

abstract={Smaller transistors mean that capacitors are charged less uniformly, which increases the self-refresh current in the DRAMs used in mobile devices. Adaptive self-refresh using an on-chip thermometer can solve this problem. We propose an on-chip CMOS thermometer specifically designed for controlling the refresh period of a DRAM. This thermometer includes a novel temperature sensor which has been implemented and integrated into an LPDDR2 chip. The LPDDR2 chip is fabricated in a 44-nm DRAM process. The sensor has a temperature sensitivity of -3.2 mV/Â°C, over a range of 0Â°C to 110Â°C. Its resolution is 1.94Â°C and is only limited by the 6.2-mV step of the associated resistor ladder not by its own design. The linearity of the sensor permits one-point calibration, after which the errors in 61 sample circuits ranged between -1.42Â°C and +2.66Â°C. The sensor has an active area of 0.001725 mm2 and consumes less than 0.36 Î¼W on average with a supply of 1.1 V. At its lowest operating temperature, this thermometer reduces the IDD6 current of the LPDDR2 chip by almost half.},

pages={2296-2308}, 
abstract={Schottky-barrier diodes (SBD's) fabricated in CMOS without process modification are shown to be suitable for active THz imaging applications. Using a compact passive-pixel array architecture, a fully-integrated 280-GHz 4 Ã 4 imager is demonstrated. At 1-MHz input modulation frequency, the measured peak responsivity is 5.1 kV/W with Â±20% variation among the pixels. The measured minimum NEP is 29 pW/Hz1/2. Additionally, an 860-GHz SBD detector is implemented by reducing the number of unit cells in the diode, and by exploiting the efficiency improvement of patch antenna with frequency. The measured NEP is 42 pW/Hz1/2 at 1-MHz modulation frequency. This is competitive to the best reported performance of MOSFET-based pixel measured without attaching an external silicon lens (66 pW/Hz1/2 at 1 THz and 40 pW/Hz1/2 at 650 GHz). Given that incorporating the 280-GHz detector into an array increased the NEP by ~ 20%, the 860-GHz imager array should also have the similar NEP as that for an individual detector. The circuits were utilized in a setup that requires neither mirrors nor lenses to form THz images. These suggest that an affordable and portable fully-integrated CMOS THz imager is possible.},

abstract={A high-power broadband 260-GHz radiation source using 65-nm bulk CMOS technology is reported. The source is an array of eight harmonic oscillators with mutual coupling through four 130-GHz quadrature oscillators. Based on a novel self-feeding structure, the harmonic oscillator simultaneously achieves the optimum conditions for the fundamental oscillation and the 2nd-harmonic generation. The signals at 260 GHz radiate through eight on-chip slot antennas, and are in-phase combined inside a hemispheric silicon lens attached at the backside of the chip. Similar to the laser pulse-driven photoconductive emitter in many THz spectrometers, the radiation of this source can also be modulated by narrow pulses generated on chip, which achieves broad radiation bandwidth. Without modulation, the chip achieves a measured continuous-wave radiated power of 1.1 mW, and an EIRP of 15.7 dBm. Under modulation, the measured bandwidth of the source is 24.7 GHz. This radiator array consumes 0.8-W DC power from a 1.2-V supply.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2469-2477}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated CMOS humidity sensor for a smart RFID sensor platform. The sensing element is a CMOS-compatible capacitive humidity sensor, which consists of top-metal finger-structure electrodes covered by a humidity-sensitive polyimide layer. Its humidity-sensitive capacitance is digitized by an energy-efficient capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) based on a third-order delta-sigma modulator. This CDC employs current-efficient operational transconductance amplifiers based on current-starved cascoded inverters, whose limited output swing is accommodated by employing a feedforward loop-filter topology. A programmable offset capacitor is included to remove the sensor's baseline capacitance and thus reduce the required dynamic range. To reduce offset errors due to charge injection of the switches, the entire system is auto-zeroed. The proposed humidity sensor has been realized in a 0.16- Î¼m CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the CDC performs a 12.5-bit capacitance-to-digital conversion in a measurement time of 0.8 ms, while consuming only 8.6 Î¼A from a 1.2-V supply. This corresponds to a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit of 1.4 pJ/conversion-step. Combined with the co-integrated humidity sensing element, it provides a resolution of 0.05% RH in the range from 30% RH to 100% RH while consuming only 8.3 nJ per measurement, which is an order-of-magnitude less energy than the state-of-the-art.},

abstract={A Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) uses a two-phase search operation where early prediction on its pre-search results prematurely activates the subsequent main-search operation, which is later interrupted only if the final pre-search results contradict the early prediction.

abstract={A low power 2.4 GHz hybrid polyphase filter (PPF) based BFSK receiver with high frequency offset tolerance (FOT) at small modulation indexes (MIs) is presented for medium data rate wireless sensor network applications.

In the continuous-wave (CW) measurement, the PA achieves a saturated output power (POUT) of around 2 W with power-added efficiency (PAE) above 65% across the bandwidth of 0.7-1.0 GHz. To optimize the ET-PA system performance, several envelope shaping methods such as dc shifting, envelope scaling, envelope clipping, and envelope attenuation at back-off have been investigated carefully. A highly efficient monolithic CMOS envelope modulator (EM) integrated circuit (IC) is designed in a 0.35- Î¼m bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process to mate with our SiGe PA. With the LTE 16 QAM 5/10/20-MHz input signals, our ET-PA system achieves around 28 dBm linear POUT, passing the stringent LTE linearity specs such as the spectrum emission mask with an average composite system PAE of 42.3%/41.1%/40.2%, respectively. No predistortion is applied in this work.},

abstract={Energy-efficient spike-sorting DSPs are necessary to allow for the real-time processing of multi-channel, wireless, implantable neural recordings. Online, unsupervised clustering forms an integral part of on-chip spike sorting. However, previous spike-sorting DSPs did not include unsupervised clustering due to the large memory required for its implementation. We demonstrate the first multi-channel spike-sorting DSP chip that includes online, unsupervised clustering. On-chip clustering has been made possible by using a two-stage implementation of an online clustering algorithm, a noise-tolerant distance metric, and selectively clocked high-VT register banks. The 16-channel spike-sorting chip, implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, has a power dissipation of 75 Î¼W at a supply voltage of 270 mV. The implementation of on-chip clustering provides a 240Ã reduction in the output data rate, which is 3Ã higher than the data-rate reduction obtained from previous spike-sorting DSP chips.},

abstract={A CMOS oscillator employing differential transistor pairs working in Class-C in push-pull configuration is presented. The oscillator exhibits the same advantages enjoyed by complementary topologies on oscillators based on a single differential pair, while yielding a substantial power consumption reduction thanks to the Class-C operation. The phase-noise performance and the fundamental conditions required to keep the transistors working in Class-C are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, for an optimal performance, both nMOS and pMOS transistors should not be pushed into the deep triode region by the instantaneous resonator voltage, and a simple circuit solution is proposed to accommodate a large oscillation swing. A 0.18- Î¼m CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz. The phase noise at 2-MHz offset is below -120 dBc/Hz with a power dissipation of 2.2 mW, for a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit ranging from 189 to 191 dBc/Hz.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS power amplifier (PA) system designed with the explicit goal of customizing a high-output power transmitter for sensor applications, where the supply voltage from an energy storage element is often time varying. The PA is intended for use in a long-range sensor transceiver and can operate directly off a super-capacitor source. A constant output-power, regulatorless, series power-combined PA with a fully integrated tunable matching network is implemented in an attempt to eliminate all energy losses associated with a high-current voltage regulator. The PA monitors the output voltage at the off-chip antenna and digitally modulates the PA load impedance to maintain a constant target output power as the super-capacitor discharges. The PA system, integrated in a 90-nm CMOS process, has a peak output power of 24 dBm with an efficiency of 12% at 1.8 GHz, making it suitable for sensor data communication over distances of several hundred meters. As the PA supply varies from 2.5 to 1.5 V, the power control loop maintains a constant output power with an accuracy of $pm$ 0.8 dB.},

abstract={A fourth-order discrete-time delta-sigma modulator (DSM) was fabricated using a 65-nm CMOS technology.

It has a sampling rate of 1.1 GHz and an input bandwidth of 16.67 MHz with an oversampling ratio of 33. It uses high-speed opamps with a dc gain of only 10. Two different types of digital calibrations are used. We first employ the integrator leakage calibration to correct the poles of the integrators. We then apply the noise leakage calibration to minimize the leaking quantization noise from the first loop. The noise leakage calibration also relaxes the component-matching requirements. Both calibrations can operate in the background without interrupting the normal DSM operation. The chip's measured signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio and dynamic range are 74.32 and 81 dB, respectively. The chip consumes 94 mW from a 1 -V supply. The active area is 0.33 Ã 0.58 mm2.},

pages={2775-2784}, 
abstract={A fully integrated broadband power amplifier (PA) is implemented in a standard 45-nm CMOS SOI technology. The PA is designed using a dynamically biased stacked SOI transistor approach, which constructively adds drain-source voltage signals of individual transistors while keeping their gate voltages within source and drain voltage limits. The design overcomes both low gate-oxide breakdown and low source-drain reach through voltages of nanoscale CMOS transistors. The number, size, and topology of transistors in the stack are optimized to deliver a relatively high linear output power over a wide range of frequencies. The amplifier under a supply voltage of 4.5 V measures a flat gain of 6 dB with -1-dB bandwidth of 6 to 26.5 GHz ( X-band to K-band). At 18 GHz, the PA under a supply voltage of 7.2 V measures a saturated output power (PSAT) of 26.1 dBm ( ~ 400 mW), a linear output power (P1 dB) of 22.5 dBm, and a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 11%. With a lower power supply voltage of 4.5 V, the PAE increases to more than 20% and stays above 17% with relatively constant PSAT and P1 dB for several measured frequencies in the range of 6 to 20 GHz. The PA occupies an active chip area of only 0.16 mm2.},

abstract={Active and passive copper cables for data rates exceeding 10 Gb/s are typically limited to less than 20 m. Optical fiber on the other hand offers superior performance for run length greater than 100 m, but is costly. Although 100 m copper link is demonstrated for 10GBASE-T, it utilizes complex symbols at a lower symbol rate across multiple signaling lanes and dissipates substantial power for DSP. In this paper, we propose a 12 Gbps/lane active cable link that extends copper cables >100 meters using low power and area clocked repeaters powered through the cable that could potentially be embedded in the cable. The quality of the clock in such repeaters is the key component in maintaining a clean signal propagation through long distances. This paper introduces an FIR phase filtering technique in combination with an MDLL to deliver a low jitter forward clock. The total jitter at the end of the cable is 4.4 ps RMS. The link has repeating distances of 8 and 16 meters for data and clock, respectively. Each repeater occupies 1 mm2 of area in a 65-nm CMOS technology and dissipates 48 mW.},

The TDC consumes 3 mW from a 1.05-V supply and occupies an area of 0.004 mm2. A digital frequency-locked loop is used to track and correct for PVT variations in the TDC and no additional linearization or mismatch calibrations are required. The DPLL uses a 20-bit high dynamic range DAC to drive a VCO in order to effectively realize a DCO with 100-Hz frequency resolution.

abstract={A 10-Gb/s adaptive parallel receiver with joint crosstalk canceller (XTC) and decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is presented. A differentiator-based XTC and a one-tap DFE are adapted to cancel far-end crosstalk (FEXT) and inter-symbol interference (ISI), respectively. When the lengths of the coupled microstrip lines change, an FEXT detector measures and compares the powers of FEXT and XTC to digitally update the XTC coefficient. Then, an ISI detector measures and compares the powers of the received data and recovered data to digitally update the DFE coefficient. This adaptive parallel receiver was fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology. The maximum power consumption is 17.55 mW from a 1.3-V supply, and the core area occupies 0.0352 mm2. For a 10-Gb/s PRBS of 27-1 passing through 15-in FR4 printed-circuit-board traces with 8-mil spacing, the measured rms and peak-to-peak jitter of recovered data are 5.56 and 30.2 ps, respectively. The measured bit error rate is less than 10-12. The measured total calibration time is 2.424 Î¼s.},

title={A Spur-Frequency-Boosting PLL With a #x2212;74 dBc Reference-Spur Suppression in 90 nm Digital CMOS}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2104-2117}, 
abstract={An architectural solution for designing a low-reference-spur PLL is proposed. A spur-frequency boosting block is inserted between the phase-frequency detector and the charge pump to boost the charge pump input frequency. Hence, the spur at the reference frequency is eliminated and is frequency-boosted to a higher frequency, fB, at which the PLL gain is much less resulting in greater suppression. Quantitative analysis of the charge pump spurs is presented to clarify the different tradeoffs affecting the output spurs level. The proposed technique breaks the classical trade off between the different PLL parameters. It adds a degree of freedom in PLL design to reduce the reference spur level without reducing neither the loop bandwidth nor the voltage-controlled oscillator's gain (KVCO). A 3.6 GHz PLL prototype is fabricated using UMC 90 nm digital CMOS technology. A -74 dBc reference-spur suppression is measured along with a (KVCO/Ïref) ratio of 16.67 and a (ÏGBW/Ïref) ratio of 1/20. The proposed architecture provides additional spur suppression of 30 dB compared to a conventional PLL and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this PLL provides the best normalized reference-spur rejection in literature. The prototype occupies 0.063 mm2.},

pages={186-198}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 1 V multi-mode RF transceiver for wireless body area network (WBAN) applications. Operating in the 2.36 GHz Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs) and the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific & Medical (ISM) frequency bands, the transceiver implements rotated differential-phase shift keying (DPSK) and Gaussian filtered frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation for both IEEE 802.15.6 Narrow Band (NB) and Bluetooth Low-Energy (LE) PHY standards. Also included is a proprietary 900 MHz ISM band transmitter utilizing FSK modulation. The wireless transceiver operates half-duplex, and for IEEE 802.15.6 achieves -104/-96.5 dBm receiver input sensitivity (for 10% packet error rate) at data rates of 121.4/971.4 kbps and -94 dBm for Bluetooth LE (for 0.1% bit error rate) at 1 Mbps. Transmit power up to +3/+5 dBm is achievable for IEEE 802.15.6 and Bluetooth LE respectively. The transceiver consumes 4.8 mA during IEEE 802.15.6 & Bluetooth LE receive, and 4.6 mA during Bluetooth LE transmit at -10 dBm output power, from a 1.0 V supply. For IEE802.15.6 transmission at -10 dBm output power, 5.9 mW is consumed, dropping to 1.7 mW for proprietary 900 MHz transmission. This performance surpasses state-of-the-art power consumption and represents the first published transceiver for the IEEE 802.15.6 NB PHY standard. It is fabricated in a 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology and occupies approximately 5.9 mm2 .},

abstract={A 2.5-7.5-Gb/s transmitter with one-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) and adaptive far-end crosstalk (FEXT) cancellation is presented. To cancel the intersymbol interference, the one-tap FFE is also employed. A crosstalk canceller (XTC) is adapted to cancel FEXT by using inverse pulses. To cancel the FEXT due to the coupled microstrip lines with various spacing, the pulse amplitude of the XTC is digitally controlled by using the proposed duty cycle detection.

abstract={A 14-bit SAR ADC is presented that achieves 73.6 dB SNDR at 80 MSPS while using a 1.2-V-only supply. In order to overcome throughput limitations common to conventional SAR ADCs, several techniques are proposed. First, a flash sub-ADC is utilized to resolve the 5 MSBs quickly prior to SAR sequential decisions of the LSBs. Second, the DAC operation is time-interleaved by a factor of 2, increasing speed while allowing a single comparator to be shared between all DACs. Third, fully on-chip DAC charge redistribution allows the DAC settling time to be improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional techniques. Finally, the ADC is fully self-timed through the use of a replica timer circuit in order to take full advantage of the fast DAC settling and comparator decisions. Despite the increased speed, the ADC consumes only 31.1 mW and occupies a core area of 0.55 mm2.},

abstract={This paper presents a frequency-translating bandpass ÎÎ£ modulator that uses single-path mixing within the ÎÎ£ feedback loop to downconvert a 4-MHz signal band from IF1 = 225 MHz at the input to IF2 = 25 MHz at the output. The proposed ÎÎ£ modulator is designed with a sixth-order continuous-time loop filter and a 3-bit quantizer. The quantizer operates at a sampling frequency of 100 MHz, which is lower than IF1 and, therefore, reduces both the power consumption and the sensitivity to timing errors relative to a conventional bandpass ÎÎ£ modulator. Furthermore, the loop filter implements noise shaping primarily at IF 2, which reduces the sensitivity to coefficient variations. The prototype chip was fabricated in 65-nm CMOS with an active area of 0.55 mm2. It achieves an SNDR of 55 dB over a 4-MHz signal bandwidth, and consumes 13 mW from a 1-V power supply.},

abstract={The paper presents design optimization strategies and a comparison of the performance of SiGe HBT fundamental and push-push Colpitts and Colpitts-Clapp voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), with and without doublers and buffers, as possible solutions for efficient milliwatt-level, low-noise signal sources at submillimeter-wave frequencies. The fundamental frequency Colpitts VCO covers a 12% tuning range between 218 and 246 GHz (the highest for SiGe HBTs) with up to -3.6-dBm output power and 0.8% efficiency. The 300-GHz signal source, consisting of a Colpitts-Clapp VCO followed by a buffer amplifier and a doubler, shows -1.7-dBm output power around 290 GHz, -101-dBc/Hz phase noise at 10-MHz offset, 7.5% tuning range, and 0.4% efficiency. Finally, the push-push Colpitts-Clapp VCO exhibits the highest operation frequency, from 309 to 325 GHz, but with reduced efficiency of only 0.07% and 5% tuning range. It was concluded that the differential cascode buffer placed between the VCO and doubler was instrumental in achieving the best phase noise and output power with good efficiency and without compromising tuning range.},

pages={2734-2745}, 
abstract={This paper demonstrates a four-channel transceiver chip for medical ultrasonic imaging, interfacing to the capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs). The high-voltage transmitter (Tx) uses a three-level pulse-shaping technique with charge recycling to improve the power efficiency. The design requires minimum off-chip components and is scalable for more channels. The receiver is implemented with a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) topology and is optimized for tradeoffs between noise, bandwidth, and power dissipation. The test chip is characterized with both acoustic and electrical measurements. Comparing the three-level pulser against traditional two-level pulsers, the measured Tx efficiency shows 56%, 50%, and 43% more acoustic power delivery with the same total power dissipation at 2.5, 3.3, and 5.0 MHz, respectively. The CMUT receiver achieves the lowest noise efficiency factor compared with that of the literature (2.1 compared to a previously reported lowest of 3.6, in units of mPA Â·â(mW/Hz). In addition, the transceiver chip is tested as a complete system for medical ultrasound imaging applications, in experiments including Tx beamformation, pulse-echo channel response characterization, and ultrasonic Doppler flow rate detection.},

The employed architecture helps bridging the performance gap between the requirements of demanding and precision industrial applications and the performance of existing ECS interfaces. The interface operates with a sensor excitation frequency of 20 MHz, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than typical values. This high excitation frequency limits the eddy-current penetration depth in the target down to a few tens of micrometers, thus enabling the use of thin targets required in precision applications. The proposed interface consists of a low-power front-end oscillator that incorporates the sensor, and a two-channel offset-compensated synchronous demodulator. A ratio-metric measurement approach along with offset and 1/f noise reduction techniques is applied to improve the system stability. The interface has been realized in a 0.35-Î¼m 3.3 V BiCMOS technology and consumes 18 mW. Measurement results obtained using two flat sensing coils show a full-range non-linearity of the sensor interface of only 0.4%, and a resolution of 15.5 bits (65 nm on a 3 mm measurement range), with 1 kHz signal bandwidth. This translates into 1.5 pico-Henry inductance-measurement resolution, which is comparable with the performance of the most advanced LCR meters. Using the proposed solution, a long-term instability below 20 ppm (for 17 hours) and a thermal drift of 30 ppm/Â°C are obtained without any temperature compensation. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed interface achieves a considerably better trade-off between power consumption, resolution, bandwidth, and excitation frequency.},

pages={948-959}, 
abstract={As device technology is scaling down, Vth's of NAND flash cell show a wide distribution due to process variations such as random dopant fluctuation, etc. Since the extension of Vth distribution is directly related to degradation of program performance of NAND flash, it is more challenging to meet the market requirements for applications such as solid-state drivers (SSD). This paper presents a novel program scheme, called Adaptive Multi-pulse Program (AMP), for the scaled multi-bit/cell NAND flash devices. In the proposed program scheme memory cells are classified into several groups based on their own program speeds. F-N tunneling characteristic of NAND cell array is considered in determining the level of program bias for each group. Adaptive program pulses are applied to the predefined groups so that cells reach their target verify level at the same time, regardless of the difference of their program speed. Our experimental results show that AMP achieves 20% improvement on program performance due to the reduction of the number of verify executions by 39% in 3-bit/cell architecture NAND flash memory of 21 nm CMOS technology.},

abstract={An oscillator topology demonstrating an improved phase noise performance is proposed in this paper. It exploits the time-variant phase noise model with insights into the phase noise conversion mechanisms. The proposed oscillator is based on enforcing a pseudo-square voltage waveform around the LC tank by increasing the third-harmonic of the fundamental oscillation voltage through an additional impedance peak. This auxiliary impedance peak is realized by a transformer with moderately coupled resonating windings. As a result, the effective impulse sensitivity function (ISF) decreases thus reducing the oscillator's effective noise factor such that a significant improvement in the oscillator phase noise and power efficiency are achieved. A comprehensive study of circuit-to-phase-noise conversion mechanisms of different oscillators' structures shows the proposed class-F exhibits the lowest phase noise at the same tank's quality factor and supply voltage. The prototype of the class-F oscillator is implemented in TSMC 65-nm standard CMOS. It exhibits average phase noise of -136 dBc/Hz at 3 MHz offset from the carrier over 5.9-7.6 GHz tuning range with figure-of-merit of 192 dBc/Hz. The oscillator occupies 0.12 mm2 while drawing 12 mA from 1.25 V supply.},

abstract={A random intrinsic chip ID generation method using retention fails is implemented in 32 nm SOI embedded DRAM. A dynamic key algorithm employs a unique pair of 4 Kb binary strings for an ID record for secure authentication. These strings are generated by controlling a wordline low voltage to search for a number of fails matching the corresponding challenge numbers. The algorithm further includes field-tolerant authentication by detecting a number of common bits analytically guaranteed for successful recognition, while preventing ID spoofing during the read operation. This results in 100% successful unique ID generation and recognition in two temperature and three voltage conditions per chip for a total of ~ 420 k ID pair comparisons in 266 chips. The analytical model predicts a 99.999% successful recognition rate for 106 parts. Finally, a method to enable a field-tolerant ID using multiple domains will be discussed.},

abstract={ADC-BASED serial link receivers are emerging in order to scale data rates over high attenuation channels. Embedding partial equalization inside the front-end ADC can potentially result in lowering the complexity of back-end DSP and/or decreasing the ADC resolution requirement, which results in a more energy-efficient receiver. This paper presents a 6-b 1.6-GS/s ADC with a novel embedded DFE structure. A redundant cycle technique is proposed for a time-interleaved SAR ADC, which relaxes the DFE feedback critical path delay with low power/area overhead. The 6-b prototype ADC with embedded one-tap DFE is fabricated in an LP 90-nm CMOS process and achieves 4.75-bits peak ENOB and 0.46 pJ/conv.-step FOM at a 1.6-GS/s sampling rate. Enabling the embedded DFE while operating at 1.6 Gb/s over a 46-in FR4 channel with 14-dB loss at Nyquist bandwidth opens a previously closed eye and allows for a 0.2 UI timing margin at a BER=10-9. Total ADC power including front-end T/Hs and reference buffers is 20.1 mW, and the core time-interleaved ADC occupies 0.24 mm 2 area.},

abstract={To improve the reliability of MLC NAND flash memory, this paper presents an energy-efficient high-throughput architecture for decoding concatenated-BCH (CBCH) codes. As the data read from the flash memory is hard-decided in practical applications, the proposed CBCH decoding method is a promising solution to achieve both high error-correction capability and energy efficiency. In the proposed CBCH decoding, the number of on-chip memory accesses consuming much energy is minimized by computing and updating syndromes two-dimensionally. To achieve an area-efficient hardware realization, row and column decoders are unified into one decoder and some syndromes are computed when they are needed. In addition, the decoding throughput is enhanced remarkably by skipping redundant decoding processes. Based on the proposed CBCH decoding architecture, a prototype chip is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process to decode the (70528, 65536) CBCH code. The proposed decoder provides a decoding throughput of 17.7 Gb/s and an energy efficiency of 2.74 pJ/bit, being vastly superior to the state-of-the-art architectures.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1910-1920}, 
abstract={This paper presents an adaptive all-digital ripple mitigation technique for fully integrated capacitive dc-dc converters. Ripple control is achieved using a two-pronged approach where coarse ripple control is achieved by varying the size of the bucket capacitance, and fine control is achieved by charge/discharge time modulation of the bucket capacitors used to transfer the charge between the input and output, both of which are completely digital techniques. A dual-loop control was used to achieve regulation and ripple control. The primary single-bound hysteretic control loop achieves voltage regulation and the secondary loop is responsible for ripple control. The dual-loop control modulates the charge/discharge pulse width in a hysteretic variable-frequency environment using a simple digital pulse width modulator. The fully integrated converter was implemented in IBM's 130-nm CMOS process. Ripple reduces from 98 to 30 mV, when ripple control secondary loop is enabled for a load of 0.3 V and 4 mA without significantly impacting the converter's core efficiency. Measurement results show constant ripple, independent of output voltage. The converter achieves a maximum efficiency of 70% for Vin= 1.3 V and Vout= 0.5 V and a maximum power density of 24.5 mW/mm2, including the areas for the decoupling capacitor. The maximum power density increases to 68 mW/mm2 if the decoupling capacitor is assumed to be already present as part of the digital design.},

abstract={A Bang-Bang Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) with adaptive loop gain strategy is presented. The proposed strategy enhances CDR jitter performance even if jitter spectrum information is limited a priori. By exploiting the inherent hard-nonlinearity of Bang-Bang Phase Detector (BBPD), the CDR loop gain is adaptively adjusted based on a posteriori jitter spectrum estimation. Maximizing advantages of analog and digital implementations, the proposed mixed-mode technique achieves PVT insensitive and power efficient loop gain adaptation for high speed applications even in limited ft technologies. A modified CML D-latch improves CDR input sensitivity and BBPD performance. A folded-cascode- based Charge Pump (CP) is proposed to minimize CP latency. The 5 G/10 G CDR prototype is fabricated in 0.18 Î¼m CMOS technology to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for applications with high ratio of data-rate to ft. The proposed CDR recovers data with BER <; 2Â·10-13 and generates only 1.04 ps RMS and 7.5 ps peak-peak jitter. Jitter Tolerance (JTOL) test shows that the proposed CDR enhances low frequency jitter tracking and high frequency jitter filtering simultaneously for various jitter profiles. The CDR power consumption is 110.6 mW where only 3.9 mW is used for loop gain adaptation circuitry.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1689-1700}, 
abstract={A Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) resonator based 2.4-GHz low power receiver is presented in this work. The intrinsic high quality factor (Q) of the BAW resonator (around 400 at 2.4-GHz) is exploited to provide channel selection at RF and in the frequency synthesis. A novel way of addressing multiple channels (arbitrary frequency) using integer dividers and a BAW digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and thus avoiding the need for a PLL is proposed in this work. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to report a multi-channel (arbitrary frequency) receiver whose frequency synthesis depends solely on the low phase noise BAW DCO and does not include a PLL. A BAW pseudo-lattice with frequency and bandwidth tuning is proposed which significantly improves the rejection of unwanted signals in the channel filter. A quadrature sub-sampling mixer is used to down-convert the selected channel to baseband. The receiver is designed and integrated in a 0.18- Î¼m CMOS process. With Q-boosting, the channel filter provides bandwidth down-to 1-MHz. For a BFSK modulated signal, the receiver exhibits a sensitivity of -78 mathchar "702D dBm at a rate of 268-kbps for a BER of 10-3 . The total power consumption of the receiver is 5.94-mA from a 1.8-V power supply.},

pages={214-228}, 
abstract={An 8-channel scalable EEG acquisition SoC is presented to continuously detect and record patient-specific seizure onset activities from scalp EEG. The SoC integrates 8 high-dynamic range Analog Front-End (AFE) channels, a machine-learning seizure classification processor and a 64 KB SRAM. The classification processor exploits the Distributed Quad-LUT filter architecture to minimize the area while also minimizing the overhead in power Ã delay . The AFE employs a Chopper-Stabilized Capacitive Coupled Instrumentation Amplifier to show NEF of 5.1 and noise RTI of 0.91 Î¼Vrms for 0.5-100 Hz bandwidth. The classification processor adopts a support-vector machine as a classifier, with a GBW controller that gives real-time gain and bandwidth feedback to AFE to maintain accuracy. The SoC is verified with the Children's Hospital Boston-MIT EEG database as well as with rapid eye blink pattern detection test. The SoC is implemented in 0.18 Î¼m 1P6M CMOS process occupying 25 mm2, and it shows an accuracy of 84.4% in eye blink classification test, at 2.03 Î¼J/classification energy efficiency. The 64 KB on chip memory can store up to 120 seconds of raw EEG data.},

abstract={A quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE cellular system, implemented in 65-nm CMOS, is integrated in a multimedia SoC with BT and FM. A low-IF receiver with digital IRR tracking is selected for its smaller area and better noise figure. The receiver achieves a sensitivity of $-$ 110 dBm, an IIP3 of $-$ 9.5 dBm, and a calibrated image rejection ratio of 65 dBc, while consuming 61 mA. The polar transmitter architecture is chosen for its SAW-less TX capability, smaller area, and low current consumption. It achieves an ORFS (output radio frequency spectrum) of $-$68 dB and $-$64 dB at 400 kHz in GMSK and EDGE mode, respectively, while consuming 61 mA. The loop gain normalization, dc offset and AM/PM delay of the polar system are compensated to be better than 1% error, 1 mV, and 1.9 ns within 170 $mu$s, respectively. Several techniques are employed to minimize interference coupling within the SoC; these include frequency planning, circuit implementation, transceiver architecture optimization, and digital clock selection. The measured sensitivity and the output spectrum of the three wireless systems under full-feature phone operation are virtually unchanged.},

title={A Low-Power Processor With Configurable Embedded Machine-Learning Accelerators for High-Order and Adaptive Analysis of Medical-Sensor Signals},

volume={48},

pages={1625-1637}, 
abstract={Low-power sensing technologies have emerged for acquiring physiologically indicative patient signals. However, to enable devices with high clinical value, a critical requirement is the ability to analyze the signals to extract specific medical information. Yet given the complexities of the underlying processes, signal analysis poses numerous challenges. Data-driven methods based on machine learning offer distinct solutions, but unfortunately the computations are not well supported by traditional DSP. This paper presents a custom processor that integrates a CPU with configurable accelerators for discriminative machine-learning functions. A support-vector-machine accelerator realizes various classification algorithms as well as various kernel functions and kernel formulations, enabling range of points within an accuracy-versus-energy and -memory trade space. An accelerator for embedded active learning enables prospective adaptation of the signal models by utilizing sensed data for patient-specific customization, while minimizing the effort from human experts. The prototype is implemented in 130-nm CMOS and operates from 1.2 V-0.55 V (0.7 V for SRAMs). Medical applications for EEG-based seizure detection and ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detection are demonstrated using clinical data, while consuming 273 Î¼J and 124 Î¼J per detection, respectively; this represents 62.4&times; and 144.7&times; energy reduction compared to an implementation based on the CPU. A patient-adaptive cardiac-arrhythmia detector is also demonstrated, reducing the analysis-effort required for model customization by 20 &times;.},

year={2013},

pages={3134-3145}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a novel architecture of digital PLL. The goal of this architecture is to reach low jitter, fractional operation, and FSK modulation capability with low architecture complexity for small area, low power, and minimal design effort. The architecture is based on the bang-bang phase detector, so that usage of time-to-digital-converter circuits is avoided, with no need for any background calibration. The key enabling blocks are a phase interpolator-based exact fractional frequency divider, and a multi-output bang-bang phase detector. The prototype implemented in 130 nm reaches 1-psrms absolute jitter while operating in integer mode and 1.9 psrms absolute jitter while operating in full fractional mode, with an output frequency of 1 GHz and reference frequency of 25 MHz, consuming 7.4 mW from a supply of 1.3 V. FSK modulation of the 1 GHz carrier up to 300 kbps with a frequency deviation of Â±150 kHz is also implemented and measured .},

abstract={A prototype 13-b 1.33-Gsps digital-to-analog converter (DAC) implemented in a unique heterogeneous integration process (combining 0.45-Î¼m InP HBT with 0.18-Î¼m CMOS) is presented. Measured performance of greater than 70 dB SFDR is achieved across a 500-MHz bandwidth centered at 1 GHz (second Nyquist band). Heterogeneous integration enables each circuit element to be implemented in the transistor technology best suited to the circuit function. Low dc power is achieved by implementing the digital front-end in a standard silicon CMOS technology, while InP HBT technology is used to implement the high-speed/high-precision current-steering DAC core. The core DAC employs a segmented architecture with three unary most significant bits and an R-2R ladder for the ten least significant bits. No calibration circuitry is required to achieve better than 11 b of dc linearity. Dynamic performance is enhanced by employing an ultra-high-linearity return-to-zero (RZ) analog output deglitcher switch. Measured performance data for three different circuit design variations of the output switch (incorporating a varying mix of CMOS and InP HBT devices) is presented.},

abstract={ReRAM is a promising candidate for on-chip low-VDD NVM due to its superior write behavior, particularly for frequent-read-seldom-write applications. Nonetheless, this approach requires a robust and fast low-VDD read scheme. Current-mode sense amplifiers (CSA) are commonly used in NVM; however, they suffer low-yield and degraded speed at a low VDD, due to an insufficient on-off current difference ( I ON-OFF) and the need for large voltage head room (VHR). This study developed a body-drain-driven (BDD) read scheme to suppress VHR and provide resistance-aware dynamic bitline bias voltage for increasing I ON-OFF. The proposed scheme achieved 2.1 Ã faster read speed, > 1.7Ã higher yield, and > 2Ã longer BL length at 0.5 V VDD than conventional CSAs. A fabricated 65 nm 4 Mb ReRAM macro using the proposed read scheme and our logic-compatible ReRAM cell achieved a 45 ns random read access time at VDD=0.5 V.

abstract={A TV-band white-space transmitter covering a 16x-wide spectrum from 54 to 864 MHz is described. It features a systematic codesign between the architecture and circuits to address the harmonic-mixing problem. Specifically, it incorporates two-stage 6-/14-path harmonic-rejection mixers and low-Q passive-RC/-CLC filters to manage the unwanted harmonic emission fully on chip, achieving an uncalibrated harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) of minimally 59.3 dB (16 samples) for all in-/out-band harmonics. The employed 8-/16-phase LO generator is based on injection-locked 4-/8-phase correctors and even-ratio-only frequency dividers to save the LO-path power (2.5 to 14.2 mW) while lowering the required reference LO frequency (432 to 864 MHz). Without any predistortion, the EVM tested under a 64-QAM OFDM digital-TV signal is 2.9% at 96 MHz, 3.3% at 384 MHz, and 4.0% at 600 MHz. The first (second) adjacent channel leakage ratio is -46 dBc ( -43 dBc) at 6 MHz (12 MHz) offset. The power consumption is 53.1 to 75.2 mW and active area is 0.93 mm 2 in 65-nm CMOS.},

abstract={This paper presents a Î£Î modulator based on a gain-boost class-C inverter for audio applications.

abstract={A low quiescent current asynchronous digital- LDO (D-LDO) regulator integrated with a phase-locked loop (PLL)-modulated switching regulator (SWR) that achieves the near-optimum power management supply for core processor in system-on-chip (SoC). The parallel connection of the asynchronous D-LDO regulator and the ripple-based control SWR can accomplish fast-DVS (F-DVS) operation as well as high power conversion efficiency. The asynchronous D-LDO regulator controlled by bidirectional asynchronous wave pipeline realizes the F-DVS operation, which guarantees high million instructions per second (MIPS) performance of the core processor under distinct tasks. The use of a ripple-based control SWR operating with a leading phase amplifier ensures fast response and stable operation without the need for large equivalent-series-resistance, thus reducing the output voltage ripple for the enhancement of supply quality. The fabricated chip occupies 1.04 mm2 in 40 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that a 94% peak efficiency with a voltage tracking speed of 7.5 V/Î¼s as well as the improved MIPS performance by 5.6 times was achieved.},

abstract={This paper reports a high-frequency DC-DC boost converter capable of sustaining up to 4Ã the rated process voltage using high-voltage devices fabricated in standard 0.13 Î¼m 1.2 V CMOS without additional masking steps. Integrated Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBD) and high-voltage stacked composite NMOS switches enable processing of large voltages in a 100 MHz digitally assisted four-phase switched inductor (SI) boost converter architecture. A high-frequency digital delay-locked loop (DDLL) is employed to automatically stagger and synchronize each phase to a primary current-mode pulsed-width modulator (PWM) controller, thus eliminating the need for multiple current sensing circuits. The converter operates in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and utilizes integrated Schottky diode output rectifier stages to eliminate dead-time controllers and power hungry high side drivers. The converter operates at 100 MHz with four external 22 nH inductors and achieves an output conversion range of 3 V to 5 V from a 1.2 V input supply. It can deliver 240 mW at 3 V and 200 mW at 5 V with an efficiency of 60%, and ~ 180 mW at 3 V with peak efficiency of 64%.},

abstract={We propose a feedback class-C voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that has robust start-up and a large oscillation amplitude. It initially starts oscillating as a conventional cross-coupled LC-VCO for robust start-up and subsequently transforms automatically into an amplitude-enhanced class-C VCO when it reaches steady-state to give improved noise performance. Detailed analysis of the start-up conditions, enhanced oscillation swing, and amplitude stability provides valuable insight into oscillator design considerations. The proposed VCO is implemented in a 0.18-Î¼m CMOS process. The measured phase noise at room temperature is - 125 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset with a power dissipation of 3.4 mW at an oscillation frequency of 4.84 GHz. The figure-of-merit is -193 dBc/Hz.},

abstract={A 20-bit incremental ADC for battery-powered sensor applications is presented. It is based on an energy-efficient zoom ADC architecture, which employs a coarse 6-bit SAR conversion followed by a fine 15-bit ÎÎ£ conversion. To further improve its energy efficiency, the ADC employs integrators based on cascoded dynamic inverters for extra gain and PVT tolerance. Dynamic error correction techniques such as auto-zeroing, chopping and dynamic element matching are used to achieve both low offset and high linearity. Measurements show that the ADC achieves 20-bit resolution, 6 ppm INL and 1 Î¼V offset in a conversion time of 40 ms, while drawing only 3.5 Î¼A current from a 1.8 V supply.

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={2}, 
pages={598-610}, 
abstract={This paper explores the scalability of in-plane and perpendicular MTJ based STT-MRAMs from 65 nm to 8 nm while taking into consideration realistic variability effects. We focus on the read and write performances of a STT-MRAM based cache rather than the obvious advantages such as the denser bit-cell and zero static power. An accurate MTJ macromodel capturing key MTJ properties was adopted for efficient Monte Carlo simulations. For the simulation of access devices and peripheral circuitries, ITRS projected transistor parameters were utilized and calibrated using the MASTAR tool that has been widely used in industry. 6T SRAM and STT-MRAM arrays were implemented with aggressive assist schemes to mimic industrial memory designs. A constant JC0Â·RA/VDD scaling scenario was used which to the first order gives the optimal balance between read and write margins of STT-MRAMs. The thermal stability factor ensuring a 10 year retention time was obtained by adjusting the free layer thickness as well as assuming improvement in the crystalline anisotropy. Our studies based on the proposed scaling methodology show that in-plane STT-MRAM will outperform SRAM from 15 nm node, while its perpendicular counterpart requires further innovations in MTJ material in order to overcome the poor write performance scaling from 22 nm node onwards.},

abstract={A third-order single-loop continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (CTSDM) with 6-bit asynchronous successive approximation register (ASAR) quantizer and digital ÎÎ£ truncator for WCDMA/GSM/EDGE cellular systems is presented.

By using the 6-bit ASAR quantizer, the sampling frequency is lowered, which reduces the design efforts not only in system level but also in the modulator. In addition, the ac-coupled push-pull stage is employed to improve the high-frequency driving capability of the first integrator. Sampling at 65 MHz, the modulator achieves 83.4 dB dynamic range (DR) and 80/79.6 dB peak SNR/SNDR with 1.92 MHz bandwidth in WCDMA mode. In GSM/EDGE mode, the DR is 96.2 dB.

abstract={In this work we present an architecture for a low power SDR which draws on techniques from both narrowband low power radios and recent work in SDRs. The receiver consists of a wide tuning-range passive mixer, driven with resonant non-overlapping LO drive combined with a noise-power optimized multi-path baseband amplifier. LO generation circuitry drives the mixer with an 8-phase, 12.5% duty cycle LO, but does so directly from complementary LC-tank VCOs in order to resonate out the gate capacitance of the mixer. A capacitor sharing technique on the baseband side of the mixer doubles the RX frequency range of the 8-phase clock at no added cost in power or performance, while achieving a NF as low as 7 dB. The 1.8 mW low noise baseband amplifier reuses the bias current of its four input channels while rejecting the 3rd/5th harmonics by >34 dB. The receiver consumes 10â12 mW (including VCOs, pulse generation and baseband) over a frequency range of 0.7â3.2 GHz with a 1.3 V supply.},

The lattice asynchronous self-timed control digital low-dropout regulator with swift response and low quiescent current was also utilized to improve iDVS voltage transition response. Results show that the iDVS-based processor with the proposed adaptive instruction cycle control scheme can efficiently perform millions of instructions per second during iDVS transition.

Thus, we have studied D-band CMOS circuits to realize low-power ultrahigh-speed wireless communication. In the D band, however, since no sufficient device model is provided, research generally has to start from device modeling. In this paper, a design procedure for D-band CMOS circuits is overviewed from the device layer to the system layer, where the architecture is optimized to realize both low power and high data transfer rate. Finally, a 10 Gbps wireless transceiver with a power consumption of 98 mW is demonstrated using the 135 GHz band.},

abstract={This paper explores a new topology of charge-pump PLL intended for ÎÎ£-fractional-N frequency synthesis. Thanks to the adoption of a bang-bang phase detector and a two-path analog loop filter, the impact of charge-pump noise on PLL phase noise is reduced to negligible levels with no penalty on power dissipation. Additionally, the proposed topology enables an efficient cancellation of the ÎÎ£ quantization error, a novel scheme for the calibration of the loop filter parameters and a low-sensitivity VCO, which is beneficial in lowering the reference-spur level. The 3.0-to-4.0-GHz fractional-N synthesizer integrated in a 65-nm CMOS technology consumes 5 mW from a 1.2-V voltage supply. The flat phase noise is -105 dBc/Hz over the 5.5-MHz PLL bandwidth with a 40-MHz crystal reference.},

abstract={Ring oscillators (ROs) provide a low-cost digital VCO solution in fully integrated PLLs. However, due to their supply noise sensitivity and high noise floor, their applications have been limited to low-performance applications. The proposed architecture introduces an analog feed-forward adaptive phase-noise cancellation architecture that extracts and suppresses phase noise of ROs outside the PLL bandwidth. The proposed technique can improve the phase noise at an arbitrary offset frequency and bandwidth, and, after initial calibration for gain, it is insensitive to process, voltage, and temperature variations. An experimental fractional PLL, with a loop bandwidth of 200 kHz, is utilized to demonstrate the active phase-noise cancellation approach. The cancellation loop is designed to suppress the phase noise at 1-MHz offset by 12.5 dB and reference spur by 13 dB with less than 17% increase in the overall power consumption at 5.1-GHz frequency. The measured phase noise at 1-MHz offset after cancellation is -105 dBc/Hz. The proposed RO-PLL is fabricated in 90-nm CMOS process. With noise cancellation loop enabled, the PLL consumes 24.7 mA at 1.2-V supply.},

The proposed CTL can achieve a measured loss of -13.4 dB and a 3-db bandwidth of 3.4-9.0 GHz as a non-contact channel for a 1-mm communication distance. This wideband characteristic makes it possible to achieve high-speed communication using a single channel. The hysteresis buffer-based receiver recovers the transmitted data from the distorted waveforms derived from the AC coupling characteristics of the channel. The interference from the power delivery coil to the CTL is also evaluated. The simulated results showed that the interference was less than -57.8 dB at 13.56 MHz. The system could achieve a communication speed of 12 Gb/s with a BER <; 10-12 at a communication distance of 1 mm both with and without a wireless power supply of 75 mArms.

abstract={Density-prioritized memories such as NAND-ROM require a longer single-ended bitline (BL) sensing scheme to maintain high cell array efficiency and therefore suffer from a reduced BL sensing margin at ultra-low supply voltages (VDD) for read-0. This is the result of 1) reduced BL discharge driving current due to limited cell size and driving voltage; and 2) a larger BL false drop noise for read-1. This study proposes a data-aware sensing reference (DASR) scheme, capable of maintaining sensing margins for both read-0 and read-1 under given timing constraints. The key mechanism involved in maintaining the sensing margin is the adaptive changing of the reference voltage (VREF), such that the sensing headroom or potential range (VBL-VREF) for read-1 and read-0 overlap, as in differential BL sensing. Two 256 Kb DASR NAND-ROM macros, with and without code-inversion schemes, were fabricated using a 90 nm bulk CMOS logic process. The 256 Kb DASR NAND-ROM macros are functional down to 0.25 V. DASR also increases the access speed by 66.7% at 0.31 V VDD, compared with the conventional approach without the proposed DASR scheme.},

abstract={An energy-efficient and supply- and temperature-resilient resistive sensor interface in 130-nm CMOS technology is presented. Traditionally resistive sensors are interfaced with a Wheatstone bridge and an amplitude-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC). However, both the unbalanced Wheatstone bridge and the ADC are highly affected by supply voltage variations, especially in smaller CMOS technologies with low supply voltages. As alternative to ratiometric measuring, this paper presents a force-balanced Wheatstone bridge interface circuit with a highly digital architecture that combines the advantage of energy-efficient sensing with highly improved overall PSRR and temperature resilience in one circuit. The prototyped circuit has a noise-frequency-independent PSRR of 52 dB, even for supply-noise amplitudes up to +10 dB FS. The maximum absolute output error in a supply voltage range of 0.85-1.15 V is only 0.7%, while the maximum absolute output error in a temperature range of 100Â°C is only 0.56% or 56 ppm/Â°C. The complete interface is prototyped in 130-nm CMOS and consumes 124.5 Î¼W from a 1-V supply with a 10-kHz input bandwidth and 10.4-b resolution and 8.9-b linearity, resulting in a state-of-the-art sensor figure of merit of 13.03 pJ/bit-conversion.},

abstract={An ultra-low voltage reconfigurable 4-way to 32-way SIMD vector permutation engine is fabricated in 22 nm tri-gate bulk CMOS, consisting of a 32-entry Ã 256b 3-read/1-write ported register file with a 256b byte-wise any-to-any permute crossbar for 2-dimensional shuffle. The register file integrates a vertical shuffle across multiple entries into read/write operations, and includes clock-less static reads with shared P/N dual-ended transmission gate (DETG) writes, improving register file VMIN by 250 mV across PVT variations with a wide dynamic operating range of 280 mV-1.1 V. The permute crossbar implements an interleaved folded byte-wise multiplexer layout forming an any-to-any fully connected tree to perform a horizontal shuffle with permute accumulate circuits, and includes vector flip-flops, stacked min-delay buffers, shared gates, and ultra-low voltage split-output (ULVS) level shifters improving logic VMIN by 150 mV, while enabling peak energy efficiency of 585 GOPS/W measured at 260 mV, 50 Â°C. The permutation engine achieves: (i) nominal register file performance of 1.8 GHz, 106 mW measured at 0.9 V, 50 Â°C, (ii) robust register file functionality measured down to 280 mV with peak energy efficiency of 154 GOPS/W, (iii) scalable permute crossbar performance of 2.9 GHz, 69 mW measured at 1.1 V, 50 Â°C with sub-threshold operation at 240 mV, 10 MHz consuming 19 Î¼W, and (iv) a 64b 4 Ã 4 matrix transpose algorithm and AoS to SoA conversion with 40%-53% energy savings and 25%-42% improved peak throughput measured at 1.8 GHz, 0.9 V.},

abstract={A design methodology for synthesis of active N-path bandpass filters is introduced. Based on this methodology, a 0.1-to-1.2 GHz tunable 6th-order N-path channel-select filter in 65 nm LP CMOS is introduced. It is based on coupling N-path filters with gyrators, achieving a âflatâ passband shape and high out-of-band linearity. A Miller compensation method is utilized to considerably improve the passband shape of the filter. The filter has 2.8 dB NF, +25 dB gain, +26 dBm wideband IIP3 ( MHz), an out-of-band 1 dB blocker compression point B1dB,CP of +7 dBm (Îf = +50 MHz) and 59 dB stopband rejection. The analog and digital part of the filter draw 11.7 mA and 3-36 mA from 1.2 V, respectively. The LO leakage to the input port of the filter is â¤-64 dBm at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. The proposed filter only consists of inverters, switches and capacitors and therefore it is friendly with process scaling.},

abstract={This paper presents a multiple code-rate turbo decoder using the reciprocal dual trellis to improve the hardware efficiency. For a convolutional code with code rate k/(k+1), its corresponding reciprocal dual code with rate 1/(k+1) has smaller codeword space than the original code while k > 1, leading to a simplified trellis of the high code-rate code. The proposed decoder architecture can decode code rate k/(k+1) constituent convolutional codes for k=1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. Moreover, two parallel soft-in/soft-out (SISO) decoders are exploited in our turbo decoder by using the quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) interleaver to improve the decoding speed. After fabricated in 1P9M CMOS 40 nm process, the proposed decoder with 1.27 mm2 core area can achieve 535 Mbps throughput at 8/9 code rate, and the energy efficiency is 0.068 nJ/bit/iteration at 0.9 V.},

These filters are appropriate for the channel selection stage of a Zigbee receiver and show with a single trim for process over a 120Â°C temperature range less than 2% deviation in the bandwidth and center frequency.

abstract={A coarse-fine time-to-digital converter (TDC) is presented with a calibrated coarse stage followed by a stochastic fine stage. On power-up, a calibration algorithm based on a code density test is used to minimize nonlinearities in the coarse TDC. By using a balanced mean method, the number of registers required for the calibration algorithm is reduced by 30%. Based upon the coarse TDC output, the appropriate clock signals are multiplexed into the stochastic fine TDC. The TDC is incorporated into a 1.99-2.5-GHz digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) in 0.13-Î¼m CMOS. The DPLL consumes a total of 15.2 mW of which 4.4 mW are consumed in the TDC. Measurements show an in-band phase noise of -107 dBc/Hz which is equivalent to 4-ps TDC resolution, approximately an order of magnitude better than an inverter delay in this process technology. The integrated random jitter is 213 fs rms for a 2-GHz output carrier frequency with 700-kHz loop bandwidth. The calibration reduces worst-case spurs by 16 dB.},

abstract={A high-efficiency, large output-power, mm-wave digital transmitter architecture is proposed for high data rate m-ary QAM transmission. Because it operates entirely in digital mode, without any matching networks, it is scalable in frequency up to at least 50 GHz and portable to future generations of CMOS technologies. It consists of n broadband mm-wave IQ power-DAC pairs directly modulated in amplitude and phase by 4 x n independent digital data streams. The output signals combine in free space to form a programmable ASK, BPSK, QPSK, and m-ary QAM mm-wave transmitter. Several proof-of-concept circuits with one DAC cell, and with one and two IQ pairs of DAC cells were fabricated in 45-nm SOI CMOS. Using a series-stacked differential output stage with four cascoded n-MOSFETs driven in saturation by a CMOS-inverter chain, each power-DAC cell demonstrates a 24.3 dBm output power with 21.3% drain efficiency and 14.6% PAE, at 45 GHz directly into 50-Î© loads. The peak drain efficiency is 30% at 22.5 dBm output power and 19.4% PAE. Experiments show 5-Gb/s BPSK, and simultaneous 2-Gb/s BPSK and 2-Gb/s ASK modulation per DAC cell in the 44-48 GHz range. Eye diagrams at 28 Gb/s further demonstrate the broadband operation of the DAC cell and its suitability as a large-swing NRZ modulator driver in fiberoptic links.},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a 40-nm CMOS 10.3-GS/s 6-bit Flash ADC used as the analog frontend of a universal DSP-based receiver that meets the requirements for all the NRZ 10G Ethernet (10GE) standards, for both fiber and copper channels. The 4-way interleaved ADC consists of a pair of frontend variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) driving four sets of track-and-hold (T/H) switches, followed by fine VGAs that drive 6-bit comparator arrays. A Wallace-tree adder is utilized as the thermometer-to-binary encoder allowing comparator re-ordering and redundancy. Also integrated is an 8-bit calibration DAC that is used as a reference to nullify the accumulated offset of the entire signal path, as well as to compensate for the nominal nonlinearity of the fine VGA and the resistor ladder. After calibration, the peak SNDR of the ADC is about 34 dB with bandwidth ranging from 3.5 to 6 GHz over all VGA gain settings. The ADC, along with its entire clock path, occupies 0.27 mm 2 and consumes 242 mW from a 0.9-V supply.},

abstract={A heterogeneous multi-core processor is proposed to achieve real-time dynamic object recognition on HD 720p video streams. The context-aware visual attention model is proposed to reduce the required computing power for HD object recognition based on enhanced attention accuracy. In order to realize real-time execution of the proposed algorithm, the processor adopts a 5-stage task-level pipeline that maximizes the utilization of its 31 heterogeneous cores, comprising four simultaneous multithreading feature extraction clusters, a cache-based feature matching processor and a machine learning engine. Dynamic resource management is applied to adaptively tune thread allocation and power management during execution based on the detected amount of tasks and hardware utilization to increase energy efficiency. As a result, the 32 mm2 chip, fabricated in 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology, achieves 30 frame/sec with 342 8-bit GOPS peak performance and 320 mW average power dissipation, which are a 2.72 times performance improvement and 2.54 times per-pixel energy reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art.},

title={A 60-GHz Dual-Mode Class AB Power Amplifier in 40-nm CMOS}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={10}, 
pages={2323-2337}, 
abstract={A 60-GHz dual-mode power amplifier (PA) is implemented in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology. To boost the amplifier performance at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, a new transistor layout is proposed to minimize the device and interconnect parasitics while the neutralized amplifier stage is co-optimized with input transformer to improve the power gain and stability. The transformer-based power-combining PA consists of two unit amplifiers, operating in Class AB for better back-off efficiency. To further reduce the power consumption and hence extend battery lifetime, one unit PA is tuned off in low-power mode. A switch is used to short the output of this non-operating unit PA to reduce the combiner loss and improve the efficiency. The PA achieves a measured saturated output power (PSAT) of 17.0 dBm (12.1 dBm) and 1-dB compressed power (P1dB) of 13.8 dBm (9.1 dBm) in the high-power (low-power) mode. The power-added efficiencies (PAEs) at PSAT and P1dB are 30.3% and 21.6% respectively for the high-power mode. Compared to Class A, the PA operating in Class AB shows 5.3% improvement in measured PAE at P1dB with no compromise in linearity. The PA with the power combiner only occupies an active area of 0.074 mm 2. The reliability measurements are also conducted and the PA has an estimated lifetime of 80613 hours.},

title={An Asynchronous Sampling-Based 128 $times$ 128 Direct Photon-Counting X-Ray Image Detector with Multi-Energy Discrimination and High Spatial Resolution}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={2}, 
pages={541-558}, 
abstract={This paper presents a direct photon-counting X-ray image detector with a HgI2 photoconductor for high-quality medical imaging applications. The proposed sampling-based charge preamplifier with asynchronous self-reset enables a pixel to detect single X-ray photon energy with higher sensitivity and faster processing rate. The use of the correlated double sampling enabled by the sampling-based architecture also reduces flicker noise and contributes to the achievement of high pixel-to-pixel uniformity. Discrimination of the energy level of the detected X-rays is performed by the proposed compact in-pixel ADC with low power consumption. Three 15-bit counters in each pixel count up energy-discriminated photons for the reconstruction of multispectral X-ray images. A 128 Ã 128 X-ray image detector with a pixel size of 60 Ã 60 Î¼m2 is implemented and measured using a 0.13-Î¼m/0.35-Î¼m standard CMOS process. It discriminates 3 energy levels of photon energy with a gain of 107 mV/ke- and a static power consumption of 4.6 Î¼W/pixel. The measured equivalent noise charge (ENC) and minimum detectable energy level of the detector pixel are 68 e- rms and 290 e-, respectively. The measured maximum threshold dispersion in the pixel array is 164 e- rms without any calibration. The functionality of our chip is also successfully demonstrated using real X-ray images.},

abstract={This paper presents a chipset including an asymmetrical QPSK/OOK transceiver SoC and a JPEG image encoder for wireless capsule endoscopy. The transceiver SoC supports bi-directional telemetry for high data-rate image transmission with QPSK modulation and low data-rate command link with OOK modulation. A low power JPEG encoder is designed to compress raw image data with compression ratio as high as 15:1 using sub-sampling technique in YUV color plane. Implemented in 0.18 Î¼m CMOS, the QPSK TX consumes 5 mW at -6 dBm of output power with 3 Mb/s data rate while the OOK RX achieves -65 dBm of sensitivity at 500 kb/s data rate with 4.5 mW power consumption. A prototype capsule has been implemented with the chipset and the performance has been verified with in vivo animal experiment. With duty cycling, the average power consumption of TX is 2.5 mW when transmitting at 3 fps frame rate.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2693-2704}, 
abstract={This paper presents a low-power decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) receiver front-end and a two-step minimum bit-error-rate (BER) adaptation algorithm. A high energy efficiency of 0.46 mW/Gbps is made possible by the combination of a direct-feedback finite-impulse-response (FIR) DFE, an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) DFE, and a clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuit with adjustable timing offsets. Based on this architecture, the power-hungry stages used in prior DFE receivers such as the continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), the current-mode summing circuit for a multitap DFE, and the fast selection logic for a loop-unrolling DFE can all be removed. A two-step adaptation algorithm that finds the equalizer coefficients minimizing the BER is described. First, an extra data sampler with adjustable voltage and timing offsets measures the single-bit response (SBR) of the channel and coarsely tunes the initial coefficient values in the foreground. Next, the same circuit measures the eye-opening and bit-error rates and fine tunes the coefficients in background using a stochastic hill-climbing algorithm. A prototype DFE receiver fabricated in a 65-nm LP/RF CMOS dissipates 2.3 mW and demonstrates measured eye-opening values of 174 mV pp and 0.66 UIpp while operating at 5 Gb/s with a -15-dB loss channel.},

abstract={An 8.5-11.5-Gbps SONET transceiver with referenceless clock and data recovery (CDR) employing an algorithmic frequency acquisition scheme is presented.

M-DQFD eliminates the dead-zone problem associated with high dispersion and low SNR links. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS process, the transceiver complies with stringent OC-192 jitter requirements. With a 400- Î¼s acquisition time, the receiver achieves a high-frequency jitter tolerance of 0.58UIpp at 10-mVppd input sensitivity. The transmitter output exhibits a random jitter of 205fsrms.

abstract={A scalable 64-lane chip-to-chip I/O, with per-lane data rate of 2-16 Gb/s is demonstrated in 32-nm low-power CMOS technology. At maximum aggregate bandwidth of 1.024 Tb/s across 50-cm channel length, the link consumes 2.7 W from a 1.08-V supply, corresponding to 2.6 pJ/bit. As bandwidth demand decreases, scaling the per-lane data rate to 4 Gb/s and power supply to 0.65 V provides 1/4 of the maximum bandwidth while consuming 0.2 W. Across a 1-m channel, the link operates at a maximum per-lane data rate of 16 Gb/s; thus, providing up to 1.024 Tb/s of aggregate bandwidth with 3.2 pJ/bit power efficiency from a 1.15-V supply. A length-matched dense interconnect topology allows clocking to be shared across multiple lanes to reduce area and power. Reconfigurable current/voltage mode transmitter driver and CMOS clocking enable a highly scalable power-efficient link. Optional low-dropout regulators provide >22-dB supply noise rejection at the package resonance frequency of 200 MHz. System-level optimization of duty-cycle and quadrature error correctors across the clock hierarchy provides optimized clock phase placement and, thus, enhances link performance and power. A lane failover mechanism provides design robustness to mitigate channel or circuit defects. The active circuitry occupies 1.3 mm2.},

abstract={High-resolution mm-wave array beamformers have applications in medical imaging, gesture recognition, and navigation. A scalable array architecture for 3D imaging is proposed in which single-element phase coherent transceiver (TRX) chips, with programmable TX pulse delay capability, are mounted on a common board to realize the array. This paper presents the design of the enabling TRX chip: a highly integrated 94 GHz phase-coherent pulsed-radar with on-chip antennas. The TRX achieves 10 GHz of frequency tuning range and 300 ps of contiguous pulse position control, enabling its usage in the large-array imager with time-domain TX beamforming. The TRX is capable of transmitting and receiving pulses down to 36 ps, translating to 30 GHz of bandwidth. Interferometric measurements show the TRX can obtain single-target range resolution better than 375 Î¼m (limited by equipment). Based on delay measurements, the time of arrival rms error would be less than 1.3 ps which, if used in a 3D imaging array, leads to less than 0.36 mm of RMS error in voxel size and position.},

abstract={A phase noise and spur filtering technique suppresses the phase-noise contribution to the receiver noise figure in the presence of a -15 dBm blocker by 25 dB consuming only 8 mA, bridging the performance gap between ring oscillators and LC-oscillators.

abstract={This paper presents a fully-integrated IR-UWB radio, designed to operate within the limits of mm-scale micro-battery for cubic-mm sensor nodes. It includes an RF front-end, battery current limiter, baseband modem with I2C interface, and temperature-compensated relaxation oscillator for frequency generation without a crystal. The peak current draw from a modern mm-scale battery must be <;100 Î¼A, below a radio's active power consumption. Thus, duty-cycling the radio only at the packet level is not an option, and so this IR-UWB radio includes an integrated modem which duty-cycles the RF front-end at the bit-level. A current limiter protects the battery from over-current conditions, and the radio operates from on-chip storage capacitance that is recharged between bits. The radio operates at 30 kb/s with a center frequency of 9.8 GHz. It consumes 291 Î¼W average power in transmit mode while broadcasting 0.1 dBm pulses, and 306 Î¼W in receive mode with a sensitivity of -77 dBm. The area of the radio is 2.73 mm<;sup>2<;/sup>.},

At 1.0-V typical supply voltage, 250-MHz search frequency is achieved. The power consumption of fully paralleled search operation at 250 MHz is 9.3 W, which is 66% smaller than previous work.

volume={48},

abstract={This paper presents a power-efficient 10/12 bit 40 kS/s SAR ADC for sensor applications. It supports resolutions of 10 and 12 bit and sample rates from DC up to 40 kS/s to accommodate a variety of sensor applications. A Data-Driven Noise-Reduction method is introduced to selectively enhance the comparator noise performance. In this way, a higher ADC resolution can be achieved with a small increase of the power consumption. A self-oscillating comparator is used to generate the bit-cycling clock internally. In this way, the ADC only requires an external clock at the sample-rate frequency. A segmented capacitive DAC with 250 aF unit elements is applied to save power and to reduce DNL errors at the same time. The implemented prototype in 65 nm CMOS occupies an area of 0.076 mm 2. For the two supported resolutions (10/12 bit), the ADC achieves an ENOB of 9.4 and 10.1 bit while consuming 72 and 97 nW from a 0.6 V supply at 40 kS/s. This leads to power efficiencies of 2.7 and 2.2 fJ/conversion-step for 10 bit and 12 bit resolution, respectively. Furthermore, the leakage power, which is below 0.4 nW, ensures that the efficiency can be maintained down to very low sample rates.},

A harmonic rejection (HR) filter is introduced to improve linearity across a frequency range of 0.1-1.5 GHz. Instead of using time-domain averaging of phase interpolators (PI) in a conventional DPC, the frequency-domain filter directly cancels the 3rd- and 5th-order harmonics of the phase interpolated signal. The architecture is designed using an inverter-based PI circuit structure to improve power consumption and area. The inverter nonlinearity is improved using resistive averaging. The residual INL and DNL are further reduced by nonlinear weighting of the interpolation. Designed and fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology, the DPC demonstrates a maximum INL and DNL of 1.33 and 0.52 LSB while consumes a power of 4.3 mW and occupies 0.06 mm2 area.},

abstract={A 3-W audio class-D amplifier compatible with AM/FM radio while requiring minimal external filtering is presented. The amplifier uses driver slew rate control to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the FM band and digital modulation to spread the PWM common-mode signal and place a null at the tuned AM channel. Two original feedback techniques are employed to linearize the H-bridge. One cancels signal-dependent propagation delays in the H-bridge to improve harmonic distortion and eliminate high-frequency noise folding into the audio band. The second technique boosts the power supply rejection ratio to simplify and reduce the cost of supply filters. The amplifier system, implemented in a standard 110-nm CMOS process, operates with a supply voltage ranging from 2.7 to 6.6 V and achieves an SNR of 95 dB and 85% efficiency.},

title={Co-Integration of an RF Energy Harvester Into a 2.4 GHz Transceiver}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1565-1574}, 
abstract={This paper presents an RF energy harvester embedded in a low-power transceiver (TRX) front-end. Both the harvester and the TRX use the same antenna and operate at the same frequency of 2.4 GHz. To decouple the harvester from the TRX, different concepts are proposed regarding the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). To avoid loading the TX, the harvester is decoupled with an nMOS switch that can be enabled with a start-up rectifier. Concerning the RX, the decoupling mechanism relies on the nonlinear input impedance of the main RF-DC converter. The harvester also includes a supply management circuit for over-voltage protection and charging energy storage devices with a constant current or voltage. The energy harvester has been co-integrated with the low power TRX in a 130 nm CMOS process and achieves a measured peak power conversion efficiency of 15.9%. For input power levels of at least -9 dBm, it is able to charge up a supply capacitor to a regulated voltage of 1.34 V. The impact of the harvester on the TRX performance is measured with respect to an identical TRX front-end without harvester, showing little impact on the TRX performance. Both TX output power and RX noise figure are degraded by less than 0.5 dB. As an additional feature, the start-up rectifier is also used for demodulation of On-Off-Keying (OOK) signaling, which can be used as a secondary wake-up channel. Since the required area for the harvester is only 0.019 mm2 (â 2% of the total active TRX area), it can be added to the TRX at almost no cost.},

abstract={In this paper a class-D smart speaker driver is presented that can deliver 2.65 W at 1% THD into a 4Î© load. Maximal output power is maintained at low battery voltage by supplying the class-D amplifier from a DC-DC boost converter. Speaker damage is avoided by a speaker protection algorithm that runs on an embedded DSP. The protection algorithm estimates the membrane excursion and voice coil temperature using a speaker model that tracks the speaker impedance which is determined by measuring the speaker current with less than 2% relative error. A sample & hold technique is presented that rejects the load current ripple by sampling at the moments where the instantaneous load current equals the average current. At full output power the combined efficiency of the class-D amplifier and DC-DC boost converter is higher than 80%. The complete system is implemented on a single chip that measures 6.6 mm2 and is fabricated in a 0.14 Î¼m CMOS technology with a 5 V gate-oxide option.},

title={Increase of Crosstalk Noise Due to Imbalanced Threshold Voltage Between nMOS and pMOS in Subthreshold Logic Circuits}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1986-1994}, 
abstract={An abnormal increase in crosstalk noise in subthreshold logic circuits is observed for the first time. When the threshold voltages ( V TH) of nMOS and pMOS are imbalanced and the on-resistance of the aggressor driver is much lower than that of the victim driver, large crosstalk noise is observed, because the on-resistance has an exponential dependence on V TH in the subthreshold region being different from normal voltage operations. A simple crosstalk noise model is also proposed and verified with SPICE simulations. In a crosstalk noise test chip with a 1.5-mm interconnect in 40-nm CMOS at a power supply voltage ( V DD) of 0.3 V, the measured noise amplitude increases from 32% of V DD to 71% of V DD, when V TH imbalance is realized by tuning body bias in pMOS. This body bias tuning can be used to mitigate the crosstalk problem in chip designs.

abstract={TSV-based 3D die-stacking technology enables the reuse of pre-designed, pre-tested logic dies stacked with multiple memory layers (NSTACK) in various configurations to form a universal-memory-capacity platform (UMCP). However, conventional 3D memories suffer speed, power and yield overheads due to the large parasitic load of TSV and cross-layer PVT variations when implemented in large NSTACK with wide IO, especially using via-last TSVs. This work proposes a semi-master-slave (SMS) memory structure with self-timed differential-TSV signal transfer (STDT) scheme to improve the speed, power, and yield of 3D memory devices, while providing high scalability in NSTACK for 3D-UMCP. The SMS scheme achieves the following: 1) a constant-load logic-SRAM interface across various NSTACK; 2) high tolerance for variations in cross-layer PVT, and 3) at-speed pre-bonding KGD sorting. The STDT scheme employs a TSV-load tracking scheme to achieve small TSV voltage swing for suppressing power and speed overheads of cross-layer TSV signal communication resulting from large TSV parasitic loads, particularly in UMCP designs with scalable NSTACK and wide-IO. To verify the viability of the proposed structure and scheme, we developed a 2-layer 32 kb 3D-SRAM testchip with layer-scalable test-modes using a via-last TSV process with die-to-die bonding. This testchip confirmed the functionality and demonstrated superior scalability in NSTACK with small speed overheads.},

abstract={A fully integrated 265 VRMS input AC-DC interface is demonstrated in a 0.35-Î¼m CMOS technology, requiring only one optional external low-voltage SMD capacitor for improved performance. The converter can directly interface the universal line voltage (50-60 Hz) and converts this into a regulated DC voltage of 3.3 V. High input voltage operation is made possible through separation of the mains input from the active circuits by custom layout high-voltage capable passive components in between. A compact model of an ideal AC-DC capacitive step-down converter is presented and the proposed circuit architecture is designed to mimic ideal operation and approach the maximum attainable power throughput accordingly. The prototype converter demonstrates a maximum output power of 12.7 Î¼W on a die area of 6 mm2 and enables integrated circuits to be supplied straight from the ubiquitous mains voltage, hereby circumventing the need for traditional converters using expensive and bulky high-voltage discrete components.},

Among the different technologies, UWB is known to potentially offer the best precision. This paper presents a fully integrated low-power UWB impulse radio receiver dedicated to communication and ranging applications. The new architecture based on double quadrature is used to reach sub-cm ranging precision while limiting the speed requirements and complexity of ADC and digital signal processing. Much attention has been paid to rejecting the out-of-band signals which could degrade receiver performance while fully exploiting the available spectrum in the [3-5 GHz] band.

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={8}, 
pages={1795-1805}, 
abstract={Conventional continuous-time ÎÎ£ modulators that use non-return-to-zero (NRZ) feedback DACs suffer from distortion due to intersymbol interference (ISI) and are sensitive to clock jitter. Using a return-to-zero (RZ) DAC solves the problem of ISI, but exacerbates clock jitter sensitivity. The clock jitter sensitivity of an NRZ DAC can be reduced using a switched-capacitor (SC) DAC, but the large peak-to-average ratio of the DAC waveform degrades modulator linearity. In this work, we introduce the switched-capacitor return-to-zero (SCRZ) DAC, which combines the low clock jitter sensitivity of the SC DAC with the low distortion of an RZ DAC. The efficacy of the SCRZ principle is borne out by measurement results from a modulator that achieves a DR/SNR/SNDR of 87.1/84.5/82.3 dB in a 2 MHz bandwidth while dissipating 16.5 mW from a 1.8-V supply. The converter, designed in a 0.18- Î¼m CMOS technology, reduces clock jitter sensitivity by 28 dB when compared with a traditional RZ DAC.},

pages={2608-2617}, 
abstract={A charge-recycling circuit and system that reuses the energy between two or more stacked CPUs is proposed in order to double the life of a battery. In this architecture, CPUs are divided into upper and lower load groups, and electrical charges are shared among the stacked CPUs and a tank capacitor. Charges are temporarily stored in the tank capacitor and are then reused. To control divided loads, a high-speed and energy-efficient regulator is needed. Internal circuit voltage variation between the upper and lower modules is determined by seven low-drop-out (LDO) regulators, a voltage-boosting capacitor circuit, and the tank capacitor. As a result, stable voltage can be supplied to each CPU, even if the upper and lower loads are different or a battery is being used. The LDOs improve the margin of collection in the tank capacitor or task schedule operation, and power efficiency is raised even further. The circuit can be implemented on silicon without a large external control circuit and inductor such as a switching regulator. This circuit was applied to an in-vehicle lock-step system because the upper and lower loads and tasks are the same. Additionally, by using the proposed task scheduling to maximize efficiency, this circuit can be applied not only to lock-step systems but also to general systems. Test chips were fabricated using 90-nm standard CMOS technology. Although the maximum power efficiency of a conventional circuit with a simple LDO is 44.4%, efficiency of the proposed charge-recycling circuit turned out to be as high as 87.1% with the test chips.},

volume={48}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1701-1709}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 65 nm CMOS digital polar transmitter with on-chip power amplifier (PA) for WCDMA and WLAN application. The proposed architecture is composed of a digital interpolation filter for up-sampling of the input amplitude-control word (ACW), a 9-bit switched-capacitor array for the digital polar modulation (DPM), and a 6-bit PA array to achieve the output power range for the target applications. A linearization technique is implemented by adaptively changing the PA bias voltage according to the RF envelope. To generate this bias voltage, the RF envelope of the PA input is extracted by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) with the ACW signals as its input. A scaled replica of the PA, which only needs to operate at the Amplitude Modulation (AM) frequency, is employed to sense the RF envelope and to regulate the PA bias voltage with an analog feedback loop to minimize the distortion in the AM path. Even without amplitude pre-distortion, the transmitter system measures RMS-EVM of 2.83% and 4.07% for WCDMA and WLAN 54-Mb/s 64-QAM OFDM respectively while providing a peak output power of 20.4 dBm with PAE 32.3%.},

The design does not use any static component such as op-amp or preamplifier that causes large dissipation of static power. DAC settling speed and power are also relaxed thanks to this architecture. Besides, the process insensitive asynchronous logic further reduces the delay of SA loop rather than using worst case delay cells to compensate the process variation problem. The ADC was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS and achieves 54.6 dB SNDR at 170 MS/s with only 2.3 mW of power consumption, leading to a FoM of 30.8 fJ/conversion-step.},

abstract={AMD's 32-nm x86-64 core code-named âPiledriverâ features a resonant global clock distribution to reduce clock distribution power while maintaining a low clock skew. To support a wide range of operating frequencies expected of the core, the global clock system operates in two modes: a resonant-clock (rclk) mode for energy-efficient operation over a desired frequency range and a conventional, direct-drive mode (cclk) to support low-frequency operation. This dual-mode feature was implemented with minimal area impact to achieve both reduced average power dissipation and improved power-constrained performance. In Piledriver, resonant clocking achieves a peak 25% global clock power reduction at 75 Â°C, which translates to a 4.5% reduction in average application core power.},

abstract={In previous SRAM designs, reducing minimum operating voltage (VDDmin) inevitably resulted in devices with a large cell area (A). This work proposes an L-shaped 7T cell (L7T) and read-bitline (RBL) swing expansion scheme (RBL-EXPD) to minimize A*VDDmin for low-voltage applications. This L7T features an area-efficient cell layout and a read-disturb free decoupled 1T read port (RP) capable of providing a wide space for write margin improvement. The RBL-EXPD employs (1) boosted RBL (BRBL), (2) 1T-RP with asymmetric-VTH, (AV-1TRP) and (3) offset cell-VDD biasing (OFS-CVDD) to expand RBL swing in both the upward and downward directions securing both `High' and `Low' sensing margins. A 65 nm 256-row 32 Kb L7T SRAM macro-fabricated using BRBL and AVTH-RP achieved a 260 mV VDDmin. The resulting A*VDDmin is ~50% lower than that of conventional 8T SRAM devices.},

number={10}, 
pages={2390-2402}, 
abstract={This paper presents an approach to simultaneously cancel flicker noise and IM3 in Gilbert-type mixers, utilizing negative impedances. For proof of concept, two prototype double-balanced mixers in 0.16- Î¼m CMOS are fabricated. The first demonstration mixer chip was optimized for full IM3 cancellation and partial flicker noise cancellation; this chip achieves 9-dB flicker noise suppression, improvements of 10 dB for IIP3, 5 dB for conversion gain, and 1 dB for input P1 dB while the thermal noise increased by 0.1 dB. The negative impedance increases the power consumption for the mixer by 16% and increases the die area by 8% (46 Ã 28 Î¼m 2). A second demonstration mixer chip aims at full flicker noise cancellation and partial IM3 cancellation, while operating on a low supply voltage (0.67 Ã VDD); in this chip, the negative impedance increases the power consumption by 7.3% and increases the die area by 7% (50 Ã 20 Î¼m 2). For one chip sample, measurements show >10-dB flicker noise suppression within Â±200% variation of the negative impedance bias current; for ten randomly selected chip samples, >11-dB flicker noise suppression is measured.},

title={A High-Speed 7.2-ns Read-Write Random Access 4-Mb Embedded Resistive RAM (ReRAM) Macro Using Process-Variation-Tolerant Current-Mode Read Schemes}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={3}, 
pages={878-891}, 
abstract={ReRAM is a promising next-generation nonvolatile memory (NVM) with fast write speed and low-power operation. However, ReRAM faces two major challenges in read operations: 1) low read yield due to wide resistance distribution and 2) the requirement of accurate bit line (BL) bias voltage control to prevent read disturbance. This study proposes two process-variation-tolerant schemes for current-mode read operation of ReRAM: parallel-series reference-cell (PSRC) and process-temperature-aware dynamic BL-bias (PTADB) schemes. These schemes are meant to improve the read speed and yield of ReRAM, while taking read disturbance into consideration. PSRC narrows the reference current distribution to achieve high read yield against resistance variation. PTADB achieves small fluctuations in BL bias voltage to prevent read disturbance, while providing rapid BL precharge speeds. This study fabricated a 4-Mb ReRAM macro to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes for both SLC and MLC operations. The fastest sub-8-ns (7.2 ns) read-write random access time among megabit scaled embedded NVM macros has been demonstrated.},

volume={48},

pages={864-877}, 
abstract={Decreasing read cell current (ICELL) has become a major trend in nonvolatile memory (NVM). However, a reduced ICELL leaves the operation of the sense amplifier (SAs) vulnerable to bitline (BL) level offset and SA input offset. Thus, small- ICELL NVMs suffer from slow read speed or low read yield. In this study, we propose a new current-sampling-based SA (CSB-SA) to suppress the offset due to device mismatch, while maintaining tolerance for insufficient precharge time. These features enable CSB-SA to achieve a read speed 6.3 Ã-8.1Ã faster than previous SAs, for sensing 100 nA ICELLs on a 2 K-cell bitline. We fabricated a CMOS-logic-compatible, 90 nm, 512 Kb OTP macro, using the CSB-SA. This OTP macro achieves a random access time of 26 ns for reading sub-200 nA ICELL. Measurements confirm that this 90 nm CSB-SA is also capable of sub-100 nA sensing.},

Twenty-four transistor-based stress sensors for measuring either in-plane shear stress or the difference of in-plane normal stresses are strategically distributed over the chip area.

The ADC operates up to 2 MS/s at 1 V and 5 kS/s at 0.4 V, and its power scales linearly with sample rate down to leakage levels of 53 nW at 1 V and 4 nW at 0.4 V. Leakage power-gating during a SLEEP mode in between conversions reduces total power by up to 14% at sample rates below 1 kS/s. Prototyped in a low-power 65 nm CMOS process, the ADC in 10-bit mode achieves an INL and DNL of 0.57 LSB and 0.58 LSB respectively at 0.6 V, and the Nyquist SNDR and SFDR are 55 dB and 69 dB respectively at 0.55 V and 20 kS/s. The ADC achieves an optimal FOM of 22.4 fJ/conversion-step at 0.55 V in 10-bit mode. The combined techniques of DAC resolution and voltage scaling maximize efficiency at low resolutions, resulting in an FOM that increases by only 7x over the 5-bit scaling range, improving upon a 32x degradation that would otherwise arise from truncation of bits from an ADC of fixed resolution and voltage.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new control scheme of zeroth-order control (ZOC) for PWM DC-DC converters in which the pole frequencies of the control loop are no longer dependent on the values of the inductor, output capacitor, or the output load current. In the proposed scheme, the output voltage of the converter is regulated by a comparator. The main control loop of the converter regulates the inductor energy which is built up to an optimum value to be delivered to the output by means of the time interval between the rising edge of the main switch driving pulse and the comparator output pulse. A boost DC-DC converter with the proposed ZOC has been implemented and fabricated in a commercial 0.35 Î¼m BCDMOS process. A maximum efficiency of 88% is achieved at a total output power of 480 mW with the switching frequency of 833 kHz when the input voltage and the output voltage are 3.7 V and 8 V, respectively. Over 85% efficiency is maintained for a wide range of the output load current from 40 mA to 300 mA.},

abstract={A broadband CMOS direct-conversion receiver with on-chip frequency divider has been integrated in a 0.13- Î¼m CMOS process. The key feature of the proposed receiver front-end is a single low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) driving a current-mode passive mixer terminated by a low-input-impedance transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The receiver chain has improved robustness to out-of-band interference and outstanding linearity. We employ a broadband common-gate (CG) LNTA with dual feedback to improve both gain and noise figure (NF) without breaking the fixed relationship between input impedance, transconductance gain, and load impedance. A LNTA load impedance boosting technique suppresses noise-amplification due to TIA, commonly found in passive mixers. The core circuit (RF and baseband signal path) consumes only 13 mW, and the prototype receiver achieves >22.4-dB conversion gain, dB NF, and â¥ -1.5 dBm IIP3 from 1.4 to 5.2 GHz. Maximum conversion gain of 24.3 dB and minimum NF of 6.5 dB are achieved at 1.4 and 2 GHz, respectively. The chip active area is 1.1 mm 2 with the entire RF signal path operated from a 1.2-V supply.

abstract={We propose a Sub-threshold (Sub-Vt) Self-Adaptive VDD Scaling (SSAVS) system for a Wireless Sensor Network with the objective of lowest possible power dissipation for the prevailing throughput and circuit conditions, yet high robustness and with minimal overheads. The effort to achieve the lowest possible power operation is by means of adjusting VDD to the minimum voltage (within 50 mV) for said conditions. High robustness is achieved by adopting the Quasi-Delay-Insensitive (QDI) asynchronous-logic protocols where the circuits therein are self-timed, and by the embodiment of our proposed Pre-Charged-Static-Logic (PCSL) design approach; when compared against competing approaches, the PCSL is most competitive in terms of energy/operation, delay and IC area. By exploiting the already existing request and acknowledge signals of the QDI protocols, the ensuing overhead of the SSAVS is very modest. The filter bank embodied in the SSAVS is shown to be ultra-low power and highly robust. When benchmarked against the competing conventional Dynamic-Voltage-Frequency-Scaling (DVFS) synchronous-logic counterpart, no one system is particularly advantageous when the operating conditions are known. However, when the competing DVFS system is designed for the worst-case condition, the proposed SSAVS system is somewhat more competitive, including uninterrupted operation while its VDD self-adjusts to the varying conditions.},

pages={1487-1496}, 
abstract={We demonstrate a micropower low-noise CMOS amplifier array that reuses bias current to improve the fundamental noise-power tradeoffs of fully-differential amplifier designs. The presented circuit implements current-reuse by stacking the differential input pairs of four amplifiers. The output drain currents of each channel's differential pair are used as the tail currents for the differential pairs of the succeeding channel. Orthogonal current-reuse improves the noise and power tradeoff by sharing bias devices to conserve headroom. With four channels (n = 4), there are 16 unique output currents (2n) from the stack, each of which is a linear combination of the four inputs. Amplified versions of the original input signals are reconstructed by appropriately combining the small-signal output currents in output stages that operate at much lower bias currents. With an input-referred noise of 3.7 Î¼Vrms and a bandwidth of 19.9 kHz, a single channel achieves a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 3.0. Amortizing the bias current across the amplifier's four channels yields an effective NEF of 1.64. The total power consumption is 15.6 Î¼W, or 3.9 Î¼W per path from a 1.5 V supply. Orthogonal biasing suppresses crosstalk between the channels, providing an isolation of 40 dB under 3-Ï mismatch. The implemented circuit was fabricated in a standard 130 nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.125 mm2. The proposed technique is useful for a variety of applications ranging from low-power neural recording arrays to multiphase radio baseband amplifiers.},

abstract={Tomlinson-Harashima (TH) precoding is a transmitter equalization technique in which the post-cursor intersymbol interference (ISI) is canceled by means of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with modulo (MOD)-based amplitude limitation. TH equalizers are suited for asymmetric links, such as DRAM interfaces, where the transmitter contains the equalization complexity and the receiver is kept simple. To increase the data rate, we propose the application of pipelining and half-rate operation to the ISI subtraction in the equalizer's feedback path. A TH equalizer with 8 taps, 6 bit resolution, and 2-PAM/4-PAM support has been implemented in 22-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS technology. In measurements, the feedback delay reduction techniques allow us to equalize 34-cm-long PCB traces having 12-dB loss with 7 Ã ISI reduction for 5.0-Gb/s 2-PAM signaling, and in 10.0-Gb/s 4-PAM mode completely closed eye diagrams are opened. The measured efficiency of the 145 Î¼mÃ 115 Î¼m transmitter is 1.2 pJ/bit in 4-PAM mode at 5.0 Gbaud with disabled equalization and increases linearly with 14 Î¼W/Gbaud per 1% increase of the equalization tap weights.},

abstract={This paper presents a 3 megapixel 100 fps 2.8 Î¼m pixel pitch CMOS image sensor (CIS) layer with built-in self-test (BIST) for three-dimensional (3D) integrated imagers. A modular CIS sub-array is proposed with new readout and control scheme. It needs only one micro-bump (Î¼bump) per sub-array, instead of per-pixel or per-column, to release the design rule restriction of the 3D stacking process. The proposed readout structure with in-pixel two-dimensional (2D) decoding function achieves high spatial resolution, without degrading the frame rate. A BIST circuit is also proposed to filter out unqualified CIS layer before chip stacking, improving the yield performance of the final 3D integrated imagers, without adding extra transistor in the pixel. A CIS chip with 16 Ã 8 sub-arrays and a pixel size of 2.8 Ã 2.8 Î¼m2 was fabricated in TSMC 0.18 Î¼m CIS process. The experimental results demonstrate the successful parallel output images of 3 megapixels with 16 Ã 8 modules at 100 fps. This shows that the imaging resolution is expandable by the proposed modular sub-array design and is expected to achieve 100 fps at multi-mega imaging for high-speed HDTV camera applications.},

abstract={The integration of a Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) with a High Power Amplifier (HPA) offers various benefits for application in array antennas for radar purposes. Among the most distinct advantages are removal of a single point of failure from the antenna system, individual bias control for local efficiency optimization, the high switching frequency which separates the spurious contributions from the carrier and the improved control of the HPA supply voltage rise- and fall times. The latter provides the possibility to control the RF pulse shapes thereby reducing the temporal side lobes and enhancing the output signal spectrum. An S-band HPA with integrated SMPS is designed, fabricated and tested. The SMPS includes the control circuitry for the switches. The SMPS is optimized to operate at a switching frequency of 100 MHz. The MMIC delivers an output power of 10 W with an HPA efficiency of more than 40% and an SMPS efficiency of more than 75%. This paper presents an overview of the design aspects and the obtained results.},

abstract={This paper presents two class-C CMOS VCOs with a dynamic bias of the core transistors, which maximizes the oscillation amplitude without compromising the robustness of the oscillation start-up, thereby breaking the most severe trade-off in the original class-C topology. An analysis of several different oscillators, starting with the common class-B architecture and arriving to the proposed class-C design, shows that the latter exhibits a figure-of-merit (FoM) that is closest to the ideal FoM allowed by the integration technology. The class-C VCOs have been implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process with a thick top metal layer. They are tunable between 3.4 GHz and 4.5 GHz, covering a tuning range of 28%. Drawing 5.5 mA from 1.2 V, the phase noise is lower than -152 dBc/Hz at a 20 MHz offset from a 4 GHz carrier. The resulting FoM is 191 dBc/Hz, and varies less than 1 dB across the tuning range.},

abstract={An ultra wideband (UWB) 64-channel responsive neural stimulator system-on-chip (SoC) is presented. It demonstrates the first on-chip neural vector analyzer capable of wirelessly monitoring magnitude, phase and phase synchronization of neural signals. In a closed-loop, abnormal phase synchrony triggers the programmable-waveform biphasic current-mode neural stimulator. To implement these functionalities, the SoC integrates 64 neural recording amplifiers with tunable switched-capacitor (SC) bandpass filters, 64 multiplying 8-bit SAR ADCs, 64 programmable 16-tap FIR filters, a tri-core CORDIC processor, 64 biphasic current stimulation channels, and a 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB wireless transmitter onto a 4 mm Ã 3 mm 0.13 Î¼m CMOS die. To minimize both the area and power dissipation of the SoC, the SAR ADC is re-used as a multiplier for FIR filtering and as a DAC and duty cycle controller for the biphasic neural stimulator. The SoC has been validated in the early detection and abortion of seizures in freely moving rodents on-line and in early seizure detection in humans off-line.},

abstract={A 0.016-mm2 144-Î¼ W three-stage amplifier capable of driving 1-to-15-nF capacitive load (CL) is described. It is optimized via combining current-buffer Miller compensation and parasitic-pole cancellation (via an active left-half-plane zero circuit) to extend the CL drivability with small power and area. Fabricated in 0.35-Î¼ m CMOS, the minimum gain-bandwidth product (GBW), slew rate (SR) and phase margin measured over 1-to-15-nF CL are 0.95 MHz, 0.22 V/ Î¼s and 52.3 Â°, respectively. The results at 15-nF CL correspond to 2.02x-improved small-signal FOMS (=GBWÂ·CL/Power), and 1.44x-improved large-signal FOML (=SRÂ·CL/Power) with respect to prior art. The sizing and optimization are systematically guided by Local Feedback Loop Analysis. It is an insightful control-centric method allowing the pole-zero placements to be more analyzable and comparable at the system level.},

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1138-1150}, 
abstract={This paper describes a new approach to low-phasenoise LC VCO design based on transconductance linearization of the active devices. A prototype 25 GHz VCO based on this linearization approach is integrated in a dual-path PLL and achieves superior performance compared to the state of the art. The design is implemented in 32 nm SOI CMOS technology and achieves a phase noise of - 130 dBc/Hz at a 10 MHz offset from a 22 GHz carrier. Additionally, the paper introduces a new layout approach for switched capacitor arrays that enables a wide tuning range of 23%. More than 1500 measurements of the PLL across PVT variations were taken, further validating the proposed design. Phase noise variation across 55 dies for four different frequencies is Ï < 0.6 dB. Also, phase noise variation across supply voltages of 0.7-1.5 V is 2 dB and across 60 Â°C temperature variation is 3 dB. At the 25 GHz center frequency, the VCO FOMT is 188 dBc/Hz. Additionally, a digitally assisted autonomic biasing technique is implemented in the PLL to provide a phase noise and power optimized VCO bias across frequency and process. Measurement results indicate the efficacy of the autonomic biasing scheme.},

abstract={Accurate measurement of synchronization cycle time is required for ultra-low power wireless sensor nodes with stringent power budgets. A multi-stage gate-leakage-based timer with boosted charging is proposed to address the high jitter of prior-art gate-leakage-based timers. The key approaches are faster load capacitor charging, wider voltage swing, and an improved gain sensing inverter. The proposed timer reduces RMS jitter by 8.1Ã and synchronization uncertainty by 4.1Ã, which allows hourly tracking with 200 ms uncertainty while consuming 660 pW. A novel closed-loop temperature compensation scheme with dynamic leakage adjustment is also proposed to achieve temperature sensitivity of 31 ppm/Â°C.},

abstract={Low-power high-speed optical receivers are required to meet the explosive growth in data communication systems. This paper presents a 26 GHz transimpedance amplifier (TIA) that employs a transformer-based regulated cascode (RGC) input stage which provides passive negative-feedback gain that enhances the effective transconductance of the TIA's input common-base transistor; reducing the input resistance and isolating the parasitic photodiode capacitance. This allows for considerable bandwidth extension without significant noise degradation or power consumption. Further bandwidth extension is achieved through series inductive peaking to isolate the photodetector capacitance from the TIA input. The optimum choice of series inductive peaking value and key transformer parameters for bandwidth extension and jitter minimization is analyzed. Fabricated in a 0.25-Âµm SiGe BiCMOS technology and tested with an on-chip 150 fF capacitor to emulate a photodiode, the TIA achieves a 53 dBÎ© single-ended transimpedance gain with a 26 GHz bandwidth and 21.3 pA/$sqrt{rm Hz}$ average input-referred noise current spectral density. Total chip power including output buffering is 28.2 mW from a 2.5 V supply, with the core TIA consuming 8.2 mW, and the chip area including pads is 960 Âµm x 780 Âµm.},

abstract={This paper presents a direct-conversion, multi-standard TV receiver implemented in a 0.13 Î¼m CMOS technology occupying less than 4 mm2. The receiver is compliant with several direct broadcasting satellite (DBS) standards, including DVB-S, DVB-S2, and ABS-S. A novel automatic frequency tuning (AFT) technique is adopted based on a searching algorithm to ensure less than 6% bandwidth deviation of the different bandwidths (over 40 bandwidth channels) for multi-standard applications. Moreover, digitally-assisted DC offset calibration is used to improve second-order distortion and calibration time of the receiver and the residual output offset achieved is less than 3 mV. An integrated Î£Î fractional-N synthesizer utilizing an optimized automatic frequency calibration (AFC) scheme enables a fast and high-precision calibration process for dual-VCO phase-locked loop (PLL) operation. The measured linearity exceeds the desired target with the minimum margin in excess of 7 dBm, and the maximum carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) values are better than 30 dB over wide input power levels, ensuring robust reception in variable environments. All circuit blocks are operated at 2.8 V stabilized by an LDO and consuming a total current of about 56 mA.},

abstract={A CMOS image sensor architecture with built-in single-shot compressed sensing is described. The image sensor employs a conventional 4-T pixel and per-column Î£Î ADCs. The compressed sensing measurements are obtained via a column multiplexer that sequentially applies randomly selected pixel values to the input of each Î£Î modulator. At the end of readout, each ADC outputs a quantized value of the average of the pixel values applied to its input. The image is recovered from the random linear measurements off-chip using numerical optimization algorithms. To demonstrate this architecture, a 256x256 pixel CMOS image sensor is fabricated in 0.15 Î¼m CIS process. The sensor can operate in compressed sensing mode with compression ratio 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 at 480, 960, or 1920 fps, respectively, or in normal capture mode with no compressed sensing at a maximum frame rate of 120 fps. Measurement results demonstrate capture in compressed sensing mode at roughly the same readout noise of 351 Î¼Vrms and power consumption of 96.2 mW of normal capture at 120 fps. This performance is achieved with only 1.8% die area overhead. Image reconstruction shows modest quality loss relative to normal capture and significantly higher image quality than downsampling.},

abstract={This paper presents a 10 Gb/s burst-mode receiver (BMRx) that was designed to have high linearity over a >; 20 dB (optical power) dynamic range. Such a linear BMRx (LBMRx) enables electronic dispersion compensation or multilevel modulation formats in bursty optical links. The LBMRx consists of a variable-gain transimpedance amplifier and a variable-gain post-amplifier. A gain from 47 dBÎ© to 85 dBÎ© was achieved on a single die. Fast (<; 50ns) gain adjustment is achieved using replica based, feedforward automatic gain control and peak detectors, which are reset between bursts using an external reset signal. A sensitivity of - 23.2 dBm at a bit-error rate of 1.1 Ã 10-3 was measured using a PIN photodiode. A 0.5 dB penalty is incurred if a 0 dBm burst precedes the burst under consideration; hence the LBMRx can support a dynamic range of 22.7 dB. A 150 ns preamble was used, the guard time between bursts was 25.6 ns. Total harmonic distortion (at 250 MHz) less than 5% was measured for an optical power ranging from - 25 dBm to 0 dBm. The chip was designed in a 0.25 Î¼m SiGe:C BiCMOS technology, has an area of 2.4 Ã 2.1 mm2 and consumes 650 mW from 2.5 V/3.3 V supplies.},

abstract={The realization of a low-cost passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tag requires the ability to fabricate the system in a bulk CMOS process without any additional process steps. A recently presented single-poly C-Flash memory bitcell provides an ultralow-power option for implementation of a nonvolatile memory array for use in an RFID system, using only core masks. This cell requires the application of a 10-V potential difference between the cell's control lines for program and erase operations. Providing the required voltages, while using only standard devices results in several design challenges for the voltage drivers, such as the elimination of gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) currents. In this paper, we present a pair of voltage driver architectures that utilize novel techniques to overcome these challenges. In addition, for the first time, we present an in-depth analysis of the dynamic behavior of standard level shifters. This analysis is applied to our proposed GIDL-free level shifters to provide a sizing methodology for optimization of the area, energy-per-operation, and delay of these circuits. The drivers were designed and fabricated in a TowerJazz 0.18- Î¼m bulk CMOS technology, providing the required functionality with a low static-power figure of 47-49 pW and 0.03-0.36 pJ energy-per-operation.},

abstract={Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) have recently appeared as a new paradigm for vision sensing and processing. They feature unique characteristics such as contrast coding under wide illumination variation, micro-second latency response to fast stimuli, and low output data rates (which greatly improves the efficiency of post-processing stages). They can track extremely fast objects (e.g., time resolution is better than 100 kFrames/s video) without special lighting conditions. Their availability has triggered a new range of vision applications in the fields of surveillance, motion analyses, robotics, and microscopic dynamic observations. One key DVS feature is contrast sensitivity, which has so far been reported to be in the 10-15% range. In this paper, a novel pixel photo sensing and transimpedance pre-amplification stage makes it possible to improve by one order of magnitude contrast sensitivity (down to 1.5%) and power (down to 4 mW), reduce the best reported FPN (Fixed Pattern Noise) by a factor of 2 (down to 0.9%), while maintaining the shortest reported latency (3 Î¼s) and good Dynamic Range (120 dB), and further reducing overall area (down to 30 Ã 31 Î¼m per pixel). The only penalty is the limitation of intrascene Dynamic Range to 3 decades. A 128 Ã 128 DVS test prototype has been fabricated in standard 0.35 Î¼m CMOS and extensive experimental characterization results are provided.},

The proposed 6-b two-voltage selector occupies only 61% of the area needed for a 6-b tree-type two-voltage selector. This study also develops a generalized architecture for an area-efficient voltage selector for multiple outputs.

abstract={This paper describes the design of a low power, energy-efficient CMOS smart temperature sensor intended for RFID temperature sensing. The BJT-based sensor employs an energy- efficient 2nd-order zoom ADC, which combines a coarse 5-bit SAR conversion with a fine 10-bit ÎÎ£ conversion. Moreover, a new integration scheme is proposed that halves the conversion time, while requiring no extra supply current. To meet the stringent cost constraints on RFID tags, a fast voltage calibration technique is used, which can be carried out in only 200 msec. After batch calibration and an individual room-temperature calibration, the sensor achieves an inaccuracy of Â±0.15Â°C (3Ï) from -55Â°C to 125Â°C . Over the same range, devices from a second lot achieved an inaccuracy of Â±0.25Â°C (3Ï) in both ceramic and plastic packages. The sensor occupies 0.08 mm2 in a 0.16 Î¼m CMOS process, draws 3.4 Î¼A from a 1.5 V to 2 V supply, and achieves a resolution of 20 mK in a conversion time of 5.3 msec. This corresponds to a minimum energy dissipation of 27 nJ per conversion.},

abstract={This paper presents an iterative decoder for faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) and orthogonal signaling multi-carrier systems. FTN signaling is a method of improving bandwidth efficiency at the expense of higher processing complexity in the transceiver. The decoder can switch between orthogonal and FTN signaling modes and exploits channel properties to improve bandwidth efficiency. The decoder is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process and occupies a total area of 0.8 mm2 with decoder core taking up 0.567 mm2. The power consumption of the chip is 9.6 mW at 1.2 V when clocked at 100 MHz, providing a peak information throughput of 1 Mbps and with an energy efficiency of 0.6 nJ per bit per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, those measurement results are from the first ever silicon implementation of a decoder for FTN signaling.},

abstract={A 100-MHz PWM fully integrated buck converter utilizing standard package bondwire as power inductor with enhanced light-load efficiency which occupies 2.25 mm2 in 0.13-Î¼m CMOS is presented. Standard package bondwire instead of on-chip spiral metal or special spiral bondwire is implemented as power inductor to minimize the cost and the conduction loss of an integrated inductor. The accuracy requirement of bondwire inductance is relaxed by an extra discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) calibration loop, which solves the precise DCM operation issue of fully integrated converters and eliminates the reverse current-related loss, thus enabling the use of standard package bondwire inductor with various packaging techniques. Optimizations of the power transistors, the input decoupling capacitor (CI), and the controller are also presented to achieve an efficient and robust high-frequency design. With all three major power losses, conduction loss, switching loss, and reverse current related loss, optimized or eliminated, the efficiency is significantly improved. An efficiency of 74.8% is maintained at 10 mA, and a peak efficiency of 84.7% is measured at nominal operating conditions with a voltage conversion of 1.2 to 0.9 V. Converters with various bondwire inductances from 3 to 8.5 nH are measured to verify the reliability and compatibility of different packaging techniques.},

abstract={We propose Bubble Razor, an architecturally independent approach to timing error detection and correction that avoids hold-time issues and enables large timing speculation windows. A local stalling technique that can be automatically inserted into any design allows the system to scale to larger processors. We implemented Bubble Razor on an ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor in 45 nm CMOS without detailed knowledge of its internal architecture to demonstrate the technique's automated capability. The flip-flop based design was converted to two-phase latch timing using commercial retiming tools; Bubble Razor was then inserted using automatic scripts. This system marks the first published implementation of a Razor-style scheme on a complete, commercial processor. It provides an energy efficiency improvement of 60% or a throughput gain of up to 100% compared to operating with worst case timing margins.},

abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated transceiver chipset based on the WiGig/IEEE 802.11ad standard targeting mobile usage. The chipset is developed for single-carrier (SC) modulation, which is suitable for reduced power consumption. However, the SC modulation is sensitive to in-band amplitude variations, mainly made worse by the gain variations of analog circuits and multipath delay spread. In order to compensate for these gain variations, the proposed chipset employs built-in TX in-band calibration and an RX frequency domain equalizer (FDE). The proposed techniques relax the requirement for high speed analog circuits, leading to less power consumption while minimizing the increase of hardware size. The test chip achieves 1.8 Gb/s MAC throughput for up to 40 cm and 1.5 Gb/s for up to 1 m while consuming 788 mW in TX and 984 mW in RX mode.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel on-chip compensation scheme, the Time-Mode Miller Compensation (TMMC), for DC-DC converter in which the compensation components are integrated on-chip. Using this proposed scheme, the DC-DC converter is stably compensated and insensitive to process variations, with significantly small compensation components ( 1 pF and 80 kÎ© in this work) consuming very small silicon area owing to the characteristic of the TMMC. The small compensation components make the chip size small, with 0.12 mm2 of core area (w/o power transistors) using 0.18 Î¼m I/O process. This core size is as small as that of the digital DC-DC converters implemented with less than sub-50 nm process.

year={2013}, 
volume={48}, 
number={11}, 
pages={2920-2933}, 
abstract={Highly reliable solid-state drives (SSDs) with error-prediction low-density parity-check (EP-LDPC) and error-recovery schemes are proposed. Since the reliability of the nand flash memory of the SSD is seriously degraded as the scaling, the conventional error-correction scheme is becoming useless. Thus, LDPC error-correcting code (ECC) is considered to be the next-generation ECC for SSD. However, many read cycles are required and the LDPC scheme consumes an unacceptably long read time. To solve this problem, the proposed EP-LDPC scheme realizes the 7 Ã fewer sequential read cycles than the conventional LDPC scheme. Instead of reading repeatedly, the EP-LDPC scheme estimates errors from VTH, write/erase cycles, data-retention time, and inter-cell coupling information. The bit error rate (BER) estimation is based on the prerecorded table which stores the relations among write/erase cycles, data-retention time, neighboring cell data, and BER. As a result, the acceptable data-retention time of the SSD increases by more than 10 Ã. Additionally, the proposed error-recovery scheme is executed and reduces the bit error if the BER of the data exceeds the error-correction capability of EP-LDPC scheme. Program-disturb error-recovery pulse and data-retention error-recovery pulse reduce the BER of the nand flash memory by 76% and 56%, respectively.},

abstract={The modelling of large systems of spiking neurons is computationally very demanding in terms of processing power and communication. SpiNNaker - Spiking Neural Network architecture - is a massively parallel computer system designed to provide a cost-effective and flexible simulator for neuroscience experiments. It can model up to a billion neurons and a trillion synapses in biological real time. The basic building block is the SpiNNaker Chip Multiprocessor (CMP), which is a custom-designed globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) system with 18 ARM968 processor nodes residing in synchronous islands, surrounded by a lightweight, packet-switched asynchronous communications infrastructure. In this paper, we review the design requirements for its very demanding target application, the SpiNNaker micro-architecture and its implementation issues. We also evaluate the SpiNNaker CMP, which contains 100 million transistors in a 102-mm2 die, provides a peak performance of 3.96 GIPS, and has a peak power consumption of 1 W when all processor cores operate at the nominal frequency of 180 MHz. SpiNNaker chips are fully operational and meet their power and performance requirements.},

abstract={Achieving wireless communications at 5-30 Mb/s in energy-harvesting Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications requires energy efficiencies better than 100 pJ/b. Impulse-radio ultrawideband (UWB) communications offer an efficient way to achieve high data rate at ultralow power for short-range links. We propose a digital UWB transmitter (TX) system-on-chip (SoC) designed for ultralow voltage in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS. It features a PLL-free architecture, which exploits the duty-cycling nature of impulse radio through aggressive duty cycling within the pulse modulation time slot for high energy efficiency and minimum jitter accumulation. Wide-range on-chip adaptive forward back biasing is used for threshold voltage reduction, PVT compensation, and tuning of both the carrier frequency and the output power. To ensure spectral compliance with output power regulations without the use of bulky and expensive off-chip filters, a programmable pulse-shaping functionality is integrated in the digital power amplifier based on a 7-9-GS/s, 5-b current DAC. Operated at 0.55 V, it achieves a record energy efficiency of 14 pJ/b for the TX alone and 24 pJ/b for the complete SoC with embedded power management. The TX SoC occupies a core area of 0.93 mm2.},

title={On-Chip Two-Tone Synthesizer Based on a Mixing-FIR Architecture}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={2105-2116}, 
abstract={A low-distortion current-steering two-tone sinusoidal signal synthesizer based on a mixing-finite impulse response (FIR) architecture is proposed. The proposed robust synthesizer adopts only digital blocks. It implements a two-stage cascade FIR harmonic cancellation technique that generates a single tone quasi-sinusoidal waveform and suppress the odd-order harmonics up to the 21st order. Differential-mode circuitry and a 50% duty cycle clock are also utilized to cancel the even-order harmonics. The single-tone signal is further up-converted to the desired local oscillator (LO) frequency band, thereby producing the desired two-tone sinusoidal signals. The proposed synthesizer contains a current mirror array implementing the FIR tap coefficients. Accuracy is enhanced using dynamic element matching. The other building blocks consist of a 24-phase clock generator, a current combiner, and a passive mixer with bootstrapped MOS switches. This two-tone synthesizer can be used to conduct a linearity built-in self-test. It is fabricated in 130-nm standard CMOS technology, occupying a 0.056-mm2 silicon area. Measurement shows better than -68 dBc third-order intermodulation (IM3) below 480-MHz LO frequency without calibration. For the LO frequency <;76.8 MHz and the two-tone difference <;2 MHz, an IM3 better than -75 dBc can be achieved. The imbalance between the two-tone amplitudes is measured <;0.1 dB across the whole frequency range from dc to 1 GHz.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={6}, 
pages={1655-1663}, 
abstract={The impact of random telegraph noise (RTN) on circuit delay has been experimentally verified using a dual ring oscillator (ROSC) array test structure. The proposed on-chip monitor utilizes the tested-and-proven beat frequency detection technique to measure RTN-induced frequency shifts with high precision (>0.01%) and short sampling time (>1 μs). The main idea is to pair an ROSC in the first array with an ROSC having a similar frequency from a second array, so that the frequency measurement resolution is not compromised at sub-0.5-V supply voltages. RTN-induced frequency shifts at different supply voltages, temperatures, and stress conditions were measured from a 32-nm high-k metal-gate test chip. The impact of RTN on logic and SRAM performance was analyzed based on the measured RTN data. We also present the quantitative results of logic timing margin and SRAM noise margin, with and without RTN. According to this paper, RTN appears to have a modest 1% impact on circuit operating frequency in 32 nm, even under pessimistic conditions (i.e., Vdd = 0.6 V, multiple RTN traps in circuit path).},

abstract={This paper presents a digitally controlled 2-/3-phase 6-ratio switched-capacitor (SC) dc-dc converter with low output voltage ripple and high efficiency. To achieve wide input and output voltage ranges, six voltage conversion ratios are generated with only two discrete flying capacitors by using both 2and 3-phase operations. An adaptive ripple reduction scheme is proposed to achieve up to four times reduction in the output voltage ripple. The complexity of controller design is reduced by using digital synthesis, and the technique is scalable with process. Fast loop response is achieved by using synchronized hysteretic control. The SC converter was fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. It can deliver a maximum power of 250 mW to an output of 0.5-3 V with a wide input voltage range of 1.6-3.3 V. Compared to an SC converter with only 2-phase operation, the maximum efficiency improvement is 20%. The converter achieves a peak efficiency of 91%.},

abstract={A processor array containing 1000 independent processors and 12 memory modules was fabricated in 32-nm partially depleted silicon on insulator CMOS. The programmable processors occupy 0.055 mm2 each, contain no algorithmspecific hardware, and operate up to an average maximum clock frequency of 1.78 GHz at 1.1 V. At 0.9 V, processors operating at an average of 1.24 GHz dissipate 17 mW while issuing one instruction per cycle. At 0.56 V, processors operating at an average of 115 MHz dissipate 0.61 mW while issuing one instruction per cycle, resulting in an energy consumption of 5.3 pJ/instruction. On-die communication is performed by complementary circuit and packet-based networks that yield a total array bisection bandwidth of 4.2 Tb/s. Independent memory modules handle data and instructions and operate up to an average maximum clock frequency of 1.77 GHz at 1.1 V. All processors, their packet routers, and the memory modules contain unconstrained clock oscillators within independent clock domains that adapt to large supply voltage noise. Compared with a variety of Intel i7s and Nvidia GPUs, the KiloCore at 1.1 V has geometric mean improvements of 4.3× higher throughput per area and 9.4× higher energy efficiency for AES encryption, 4095-b low-density parity-check decoding, 4096-point complex fast Fourier transform, and 100-B record sorting applications.},

title={A Wideband Noise-Canceling CMOS LNA With Enhanced Linearity by Using Complementary nMOS and pMOS Configurations}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1331-1344}, 
abstract={A complementary noise-canceling CMOS low-noise amplifier (LNA) with enhanced linearity is proposed. An active shunt feedback input stage offers input matching, while extended input matching bandwidth is acquired by a π-type matching network. The intrinsic noise cancellation mechanism maintains acceptable noise figure (NF) with reduced power consumption due to the current reuse principle. Multiple complementary nMOS and pMOS configurations commonly restrain nonlinear components in individual stage of the LNA. Complementary multigated transistor architecture is further employed to nullify the third-order distortion of noise-canceling stage and compensate the second-order nonlinearity of that. High third-order input intercept point (IIP3) is thus obtained, while the secondorder input intercept point (IIP2) is guaranteed by differential operation. Implemented in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the experimental results show that the proposed LNA provides a maximum gain of 17.5 dB and an input 1-dB compression point (IP1 dB) of -3 dBm. An NF of 2.9-3.5 dB and an IIP3 of 10.6-14.3 dBm are obtained from 0.1 to 2 GHz, respectively. The circuit core only draws 9.7 mA from a 2.2 V supply.},

title={A Fully Passive Compressive Sensing SAR ADC for Low-Power Wireless Sensors}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={8}, 
pages={2154-2167}, 
abstract={The compressive sensing (CS) theory states that the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to reduce the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) conversion rate and save power. However, most previous CS frameworks require dedicated analog CS encoders built by power-hungry active amplifiers, which limit the overall power saving. Differently, this paper proposes a fully passive switched-capacitor-based CS framework that directly embeds CS into a successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC. The proposed CS-SAR ADC can operate in two modes: the Nyquist mode and the CS mode. In the CS mode, the CS-SAR ADC quantizes the input once every four-time sampling, reducing the conversion rate and the circuit power by four times compared to the Nyquist mode. A prototype chip is fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. At 0.8 V and 1 MS/s, the chip consumes 19.2 μW in the Nyquist mode and 5 μW in the CS mode. Discrete-tone signals are converted and reconstructed with a peak signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of 61 dB and maximum bandwidth occupancy of 8.2%. Speech signals are also used to demonstrate the capability of the chip to compressively sense real-world signals. Compared to prior CS works, it improves the post-reconstruction SNDR by 18 dB and the energy efficiency by 13 times.},

pages={1591-1604}, 
abstract={This paper presents a high-performance digitizer based on column-parallel single-slope analog-to-digital converter (SS-ADC) topology for readout of a back-illuminated 3-D-stacked CMOS image sensor. To address the high power consumption issue in high speed digital counters, a passing window (PW)-based hybrid counter topology is proposed. In this approach, the memory cells in the digital counters of SS-ADCs are disconnected from the global bus during non-relevant timing. To address the high column fixed pattern noise (FPN) under bright illumination conditions, a double auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is proposed. In this technique, the AZ process is employed twice at reset and signal level, respectively. The double AZ scheme not only allows the comparator to serve as a crossing detector around the common-mode level, but it also enables low-voltage comparator design. The proposed techniques are experimentally verified in a prototype chip designed and fabricated in the TSMC 40 nm low-power CMOS process. The PW technique saves 52.8% of power consumption in the hybrid digital counters. Dark/bright column FPN of 0.0024%/0.028% is achieved employing the proposed double AZ technique for digital correlated double sampling. A single-column digitizer consumes a total power of 66.8 μW and occupies an area of 5.4 μm × 610 μm.},

abstract={This paper presents a 32 Gb/s non-return-to-zero optical link using 850-nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser-based multi-mode optics with 14-nm bulk FinFET CMOS circuits. The target application is the integration of optics on to the first-level package, connecting high-speed optical I/O directly to an advanced CMOS host chip (e.g., processor and switch) to increase package I/O bandwidth density and lower overall system power and cost. The optical link is designed for maximum link margin to tolerate high optical losses created by low-cost optical packaging. The transmitter (TX) uses a three-tap, 1/2-unit-interval-spaced feed-forward equalizer to improve eye opening. The receiver (RX) uses a low-bandwidth, low-noise transimpedance amplifier and a speculative one-tap decision-feedback equalizer for high sensitivity. The TX and RX power efficiencies are 3.3 and 1.4 pJ/bit, respectively. The TX optical modulation amplitude (OMA) is 1.2 dBm, and the RX sensitivity is -11.7 dBm OMA at a bit error rate of 10⁻¹² with PRBS31 data, providing 12.9-dB link margin.},

abstract={This paper presents the architectural concept and implementation of a mostly digital voltage-controlled oscillator-analog-to-digital converter (VCO-ADC) with third-order quantization noise shaping. The system is based on the combination of a VCO and a digital counter. It is shown how this combination can function as a continuous-time integrator to form a high-order continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (CT-SDM). The counter consists only of digital building blocks, and the VCOs are implemented using ring oscillators, which are also digital-friendly. No traditional analog blocks, such as opamps, OTAs, or comparators, are used. As a proof of concept, we have implemented a third-order VCO-based CT-SDM for a 10-MHz bandwidth in the low-power version of a 65-nm CMOS technology. This prototype shows a measured performance of 71/66.2/62.5-dB DR/SNR/SNDR at a 10-MHz bandwidth while consuming 1.8 mW from a 1.0-V analog and 1.9 mW from a 1.2-V digital supply. With digital calibration, the nonlinearity could be pushed below the noise level, leading to an improved peak SNDR of 66 dB.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={3056-3070}, 
abstract={A reconfigurable power management structure for inductive power delivery has been proposed by adaptively employing either resonant voltage or current mode (VM or CM) to improve the inductive power transmission performance against coils' coupling distance (d), orientation (φ), and load impedance (RL) variations. At the presence of these variations, unlike conventional VM and CM power managements with poor voltageand power-conversion efficiencies (VCE and PCE), respectively, the proposed voltage/current-mode inductive power management (VCIPM) chip can achieve high VCE by automatically switching to CM when the receiver (Rx) coil voltage (VR) is smaller than the required load voltage (VL), and achieve high PCE by operating in VM when VR > VL. In addition, since VM and CM are only suitable for small and large RL within the range of hundreds of ohms and above, respectively, the VCIPM chip can extend the RL range. The VCIPM chip also eliminates the need for two off-chip capacitors by performing rectification, regulation, and over-voltage protection (OVP) in one step with one off-chip capacitor. In VM, intentional reverse current is employed for both voltage regulation and OVP, while the Rx coil switching frequency (fsw) is adjusted for voltage regulation in CM. The theory behind the proposed VCIPM structure has been presented and validated by simulations and measurements. A VCIPM prototype chip was fabricated in a 0.35-μm 2P4M standard CMOS process occupying 0.52-mm2 active area. In measurements, the VCIPM chip, operating at 1 MHz, achieved a high VCE of 4.1 V/V for RL of 100 kΩ by operating in CM with fsw = 166.6 kHz, and extended d and φ from 6 to 13.5 cm (125%) and 30° to 75° (150%), respectively, compared to its VM counterpart by ad- ptively switching from VM to CM.},

abstract={With advances in semiconductor technology, the threshold voltage variation has worsened, which has a great impact on the speed and stability of static random access memory (SRAM). This paper proposes a pipeline replica bitline (RBL) delay technique designed to reduce the timing variation of SRAM sense amplifiers. This design takes full advantage of all cells in the RBL as replica cells (RCs). A tunable pipeline structure is applied to control the discharge of groups of RCs. The structure is designed based on theoretical analysis and fabricated using an SMIC 28-nm CMOS process. The measurement results show that the delay variation can be reduced by approximately 43% and 32% compared with the conventional RBL and multistage RBL, respectively. Furthermore, with slight tuning of the normal 28-nm foundry process, four wafers were obtained under extreme conditions to comprehensively test the proposed technique. The results show that the proposed technique is more stable than other techniques in any extreme condition.},

abstract={This paper presents an electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition and biomarker-extraction system based on flexible, thin-film electronics. There exist commercial, single-use, flexible, pre-gelled electrode arrays; however, these are fully passive, requiring cabling to transfer sensitive, low-amplitude signals to external electronics for readout and processing. This work presents an active EEG acquisition system on flex, based on amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The system incorporates embedded chopper-stabilized a-Si TFT low-noise amplifiers, to enhance signal integrity, and a-Si TFT compressive-sensing scanning circuits, to enable reduction of EEG data from many channels onto a single interface, for subsequent processing by a CMOS IC. Further, the system uses an algorithm, by which spectral-energy features, a key EEG biomarker, are extracted directly from the compressed signals. We demonstrate a prototype, performing EEG acquisition from a human subject, and compressed EEG data. The TFT amplifier achieves a noise PSD of 230 nV/√Hz. reconstruction and seizure detection via analog replay of patient Seizure detection, at up to 64× compression, achieves error rates <;8%.

abstract={This paper presents a power- and area-efficient front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is directly integrated with an array of 32 × 32 piezoelectric transducer elements to enable next-generation miniature ultrasound probes for real-time 3-D transesophageal echocardiography. The 6.1 × 6.1 mm2 ASIC, implemented in a low-voltage 0.18-μm CMOS process, effectively reduces the number of receive (RX) cables required in the probe's narrow shaft by ninefold with the aid of 96 delay-and-sum beamformers, each of which locally combines the signals received by a sub-array of 3 × 3 elements. These beamformers are based on pipeline-operated analog sample-and-hold stages and employ a mismatch-scrambling technique to prevent the ripple signal associated with the mismatch between these stages from limiting the dynamic range. In addition, an ultralow-power low-noise amplifier architecture is proposed to increase the power efficiency of the RX circuitry. The ASIC has a compact element matched layout and consumes only 0.27 mW/channel while receiving, which is lower than the state-of-the-art circuit. Its functionality has been successfully demonstrated in 3-D imaging experiments.},

abstract={This paper presents an impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) receiver design for precise wireless ranging using a newly proposed direct sampling with time-extension (DTE) method. To overcome the problems encountered in high-speed sampling for impulse signals, the DTE method, which exploits the characteristics of an impulse, is proposed. The proposed method performs high-speed sampling only during the period when short pulses exist, and quantizes the sampled signal during the dead time where no pulses exist. The high-speed impulse signal can be easily digitized using low-speed analog-to-digital converter. We designed and fabricated the IR-UWB receiver using a 65-nm CMOS process. The measurement result shows a 1.9-mm resolution for indoor wireless ranging within a 1-m range. The receiver has a power consumption of 70 mW at 1.2 V and energy efficiency of 1554 nJ/pulse.},

number={8}, 
pages={2026-2037}, 
abstract={This paper presents an energy efficient full-duplex (FD) current-mode transceiver for on-chip global interconnects. As it shares the same signaling port for transmitting and receiving signal, the wire efficiency is increased by 2× compared to unidirectional transceivers. The proposed hybrid transceiver has a directional inverter/buffer (DIB) circuit which inverts the outbound signal whereas conveys the incoming signal maintaining the same phase with a gain greater than one. As a result, the incoming signal is seamlessly separated from the strong outbound signal just by weighted addition of the two compound signals on the either sides of the DIB by a transconductor (gm) circuit. This is in contrast to existing subtraction based signal dissociation architecture. Importantly, the inbound signal retrieval process is a constructive one where the two components of the incoming signal are added up to provide inherent gain, making it suitable for lossy on-chip link. Moreover, the DIB circuit has very low active impedance at its input/output node and hence supports high bandwidth transmission without using any passive terminator. A prototype design has been implemented in 0.18-μm CMOS process for a global interconnect of 5 mm length. Measured results give an efficiency of 0.19 pJ/b/mm for an FD operation of 4.0 Gb/s.},

pages={1753-1767}, 
abstract={Polyphase-FFT (P-FFT) techniques allow for low power implementations of high performance multi-channel filter banks by utilizing computation sharing like a standard fast Fourier transform (FFT). Additionally, it enables a longer “effective window length” than is possible in a standard FFT. This characteristic breaks the trade-off between the main-lobe width and the side-lobe amplitudes in normal finite impulse response filters. Thus, P-FFT techniques have been employed for the channelization of wideband input signals in high speed digital communication receivers. In this paper, we present a prototype analog P-FFT based filter bank in discrete time that is used to channelize wideband input signals so as to reduce the speed and dynamic range requirement of the ADCs. The four-channel I/Q prototype is implemented using TSMC's 65 nm GP technology. Based on passive switches, the design operates at high speed, consumes low power, and offers high linearity performance. The measured transfer function shows >38 dB side-lobe suppression at 1 GS/s operation. The average measured IIP3 is +25 dBm differential power and the total integrated output noise is 208 μVrms. The total power consumption for the P-FFT filter bank (eight-channels total) is 34.6 mW (34.6 pJ/conv).},

A data rate of 28.16 Gb/s is achieved in 16 QAM by four-channel bonding. The transmitter, receiver, and phase-locked loop consume 186, 155, and 64 mW, respectively. The core area of the transceiver is 3.9 mm2. For the proposed two-stream FI transceiver, four-channel bonding in 64 QAM is realized with a data rate of 42.24 Gb/s and an EVM of less than -23 dB. The front end consumes 544 mW in transmitting mode and 432 mW in receiving mode from a 1.2-V supply. The core area of the transceiver is 7.2 mm2.},

abstract={A 6.78-MHz wireless power receiver using a 3-mode reconfigurable resonant regulating rectifier for resonant wireless power transfer is presented. The proposed receiver improves power conversion efficiency and reduces die area and off-chip components by achieving power conversion plus voltage regulation in one stage, using only four on-chip power transistors and one off-chip capacitor. Moreover, the proposed 3-mode operation reduces the output voltage ripples and accomplishes switching synchronization easily during mode switching. The proposed pulsewidth modulation controller using ramp-stacking technique and type-II compensation achieves tight voltage regulation in the full loading range with fast transient responses. An adaptive sizing method is also employed to further improve the light-load efficiency of the receiver. Fabricated in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS process using 5-V devices, the receiver regulates the output voltage at 5 V and delivers a maximum power of 6 W. The measured peak efficiency reaches 92.2% when delivering an output power of 3.5 W. For a load step between 0.5 and 5 W, the overshoot and undershoot are less than 300 mV and the settling times are less than 16 μs.},

abstract={A 65-nm CMOS, 18-mm2, 1.5-GHz 64 × 64 crosscorrelator with 128 on-chip analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) enables real-time synthetic aperture radiometric imaging. This brief enables high-resolution synthetic aperture radiometry by greatly improving the integration and energy efficiency of the mixed-signal baseband cross-correlator. The design supports analog-in and digital correlation out, removing approximately 5 W of power that would otherwise be needed for I/O between the ADCs and the digital correlation core. The prototype 6.144T correlation/s 1.5 Gsamples/s 64 × 64 correlator is designed for satellite-based radiometric imaging of water in the atmosphere. Massive parallelism together with an optimized correlation scheme leads to a measured energy consumption of only 0.35 pJ/correlation/cycle. A correlation efficiency greater than 90% is achieved for input signal levels greater than -30 dBm.},

abstract={Previous 6T SRAMs commonly employ a wordline voltage underdrive (WLUD) scheme to suppress half-select (HS) disturbs in read and write cycles, at the expense of reduced cell read current (ICELL) and degraded write margin (WM). This paper proposes the dual-split-control (DSC) scheme, including split WLs and split cell VSS (CVSS), for 6T SRAM to maintain a compact cell area and improve HS cell stability during the read and write cycles without degrading ICELL and WM. A segmented CVSS-strapping scheme is developed to suppress the ground bounce on the split-CVSS lines. The CVSS voltage for S6T can be generated by either a constant voltage source or a charge-sharing-based CVSS generation scheme. A 28-nm 256-kb DSC6T SRAM macro was fabricated and achieves a 280-mV lower VDDmin than a conventional 6T SRAM.},

The RX employs a two-stage continuous-time linear equalizer as the analog front end and integrates a low-cost sign-based zero-forcing engine relying on edge-data correlation to automatically adjust the tap weights of the TX-FFE. By embedding low-pass filters with an adaptively adjusting bandwidth into the data-sampling path and adopting high-linearity compensating phase interpolators, the clock data recovery achieves both high jitter tolerance and low jitter generation.

abstract={This paper presents a 4 + 2T SRAM for embedded searching and in-memory-computing applications. The proposed SRAM cell uses the n-well as the write wordline to perform write operations and eliminate the write access transistors, achieving 15% area saving compared with conventional 8T SRAM. The decoupled differential read paths significantly improve read noise margin, and therefore reliable multi-word activation can be enabled to perform in-memory Boolean logic functions. Reconfigurable differential sense amplifiers are employed to realize fast normal read or multi-functional logic operations. Moreover, the proposed 4 + 2T SRAM can be reconfigured as binary content-addressable memory (BCAM) or ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) for searching operations, achieving 0.13 fJ/search/bit at 0.35 V. The chip is fabricated in 55-nm deeply depleted channel technology. The area efficiency is 65% for a 128 x 128 pushed-rule array including all peripherals such as column-wise sense amplifier for read/logic and row-wise sense amplifier for BCAM/TCAM operations. Forty dies across five wafers in different corners are measured, showing a worst-case read/write VDDmin of 0.3 V.},

abstract={A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) inductor-free 3-D hover sensor is presented. This paper solved the low-signal component issue, which is the biggest problem in 3-D hover sensing. For this purpose, we propose a power- and cost-effective high-voltage driving technique in the self-capacitance sensing scheme (SCSS) and lateral resolution optimization of a touch panel. In addition, the huge panel offsets in the SCSS from both vertical panel capacitance (CSV) and horizontal panel capacitance (CSH) can effectively be eliminated by exploiting the panel's natural characteristics, without using other costly resources. Therefore, in the proposed design, the total calibration block is minimized only for parasitic capacitance mismatches. Last, by adopting new driving scheme, two-phase simultaneous sensing is enabled to increase the SNR further. The proposed hover sensing system achieved a 39-dB SNR at a 1-cm hover point under a 240-Hz scan rate condition in noise experiments, while consuming 183 μW/electrode and 0.73 mm²/sensor, which are the lowest power per electrode performance and the smallest die-area per sensor performance, respectively, in comparison to the state-of-the-art 3-D hover systems.},

abstract={This paper presents a power- and area-efficient 16-way time-interleaved (TI) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) achieving 24-GS/s conversion speed and 6-bit resolution in 28-nm CMOS. A voltage-time hybrid pipeline technique exploiting the comparator input-voltage-output-time dependency is reported to enhance the throughput of successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADCs. A reference-buffer-free capacitive digital-to-analog (CDAC) converter is utilized to mitigate the crosstalk problem in TI-ADCs. Timing mismatches between individual sub-ADCs are estimated with a reference-ADC dithering technique and corrected by digitally controlled delay lines (DCDL). The techniques collectively enabled a very compact design, obviating any input buffer or hierarchical sampling structures. The ADC core consumes 23 mW and occupies an area of 0.03 mm2. A signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of 35 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 54 dB were measured for a 40-MHz input. For a Nyquist input, the prototype measured an SNDR of 29 dB and an SFDR of 41 dB with all timing mismatch spurs suppressed below -50 dBc after skew calibration.},

abstract={This paper presents a reference error calibration scheme for successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) verified with two prototypes. Such a reference error often occurs in high-speed SAR ADCs due to the signal dependent fast switching transient, and leads to a large differential nonlinearity and missing codes, eventually degrading conversion accuracy. The calibration concept aims to differentiate the error outputs and correct them by simply performing a subtraction in the digital domain. It runs in the background with a little hardware overhead, and does not depend on the type of the input signal or reduce the dynamic range. Two prototypes were measured which are made up of different reference generation circuits. Design #1 has the reference voltage from off-chip and a 3-pF decoupling capacitor on-chip, while design #2 includes an on-chip reference buffer. Both designs were fabricated in 65-nm CMOS and achieve at least 9-dB improvement on signal-to-(Noise + Distortion) ratio (SNDR) after calibration. The total core area is around 0.012 mm2 for both chips and the Nyquist SNDR of designs #1 and #2 is 59.03 and 57.93 dB, respectively.},

abstract={This paper presents a readout method and circuit for large, capacitive-type touch-screen panels (TSPs). Despite the considerable amount of RC time delay of large-area TSPs, the proposed readout method with a receiver (Rx) input seriescapacitor improves the settling speed of signals transferred from the transmitter (Tx) to the Rx, by reducing the RC time delay. Combined with the Rx input series-capacitor, a capacitive-input fully differential filtered charge integrator effectively cancels out the display noise and reduces the self-noise in capacitive-type TSPs. The proposed Rx circuit was implemented using 0.35-μm CMOS. Using a 65-in metal-mesh TSP with 169 Tx and 97 Rx electrodes mounted on a liquid-crystal display for testing, the proposed readout method achieved 65% reduction of signal settling time within an accuracy of ≥3τ for the longest signal path of the TSP. Using the RC time delay reduction technique, the Tx driving frequency could be boosted by as much as 400 kHz, and the measured signal-to-noise ratio of 43.5 dB was obtained for finger touch at a 120-Hz scan rate, resulting in a figureof-merit of 0.26 nJ/node, while the overall power consumption was 76 mW.},

abstract={A highly digital two-stage fractional-N phaselocked loop (PLL) architecture utilizing a first-order 1-bit ΔΣ frequency-to-digital converter (FDC) is proposed and implemented in a 65nm CMOS process. Performance of the first-order 1-bit ΔΣ FDC is improved by using a phase interpolatorbased fractional divider that reduces phase quantizer input span and by using a multiplying delay-locked loop that increases its oversampling ratio. We also describe an analogy between a time-to-digital converter (TDC) and a ΔΣ FDC followed by an accumulator that allows us to leverage the TDC-based PLL analysis techniques to study the impact of ΔΣ FDC characteristics on ΔΣ FDC-based fractional-N PLL (FDCPLL) performance. Utilizing proposed techniques, a prototype PLL achieves 1 MHz bandwidth, -101.6 dBc/Hz in-band phase noise, and 1.22psrms (1 kHz-40 MHz) jitter while generating 5.031GHz output from 31.25MHz reference clock input. For the same output frequency, the stand-alone second-stage fractional-N FDCPLL achieves 1MHz bandwidth, -106.1dBc/Hz in-band phase noise, and 403fsrms jitter with a 500MHz reference clock input. The two-stage PLL consumes 10.1mW power from a 1V supply, out of which 7.1 mW is consumed by the second-stage FDCPLL.},

pages={1563-1575}, 
abstract={This paper describes a 5.8 Gb/s adaptive integrating duobinary decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) for use in next-generation multi-drop memory interface. The proposed receiver combines traditional interface techniques like the integrated signaling and the duobinary signaling, in which the duobinary signal is generated by current integration in the receiver. It can address issues such as input data dependence during integration, need for precursor equalization, high equalizer gain boosting, and sensitivity to high-frequency noise. The proposed receiver also alleviates DFE critical timing to provide gain in speed, and embed DFE taps in duobinary decoding to provide gain in power and area. The adaptation for adjusting the equalizer common-mode level, duobinary zero level, tap coefficient values, and timing recovery is incorporated. The proposed DFE receiver was fabricated in a 45 nm CMOS process, whose measurement results indicated that it worked at 5.8 Gb/s speed in a four-drop channel configuration with seven slave ICs, and the bathtub curve shows 36% open for 10-10 bit error rate.},

year={2017},

pages={218-228}, 
abstract={For multilevel cell (MLC) phase change memory (PCM), resistance drift (R-drift) phenomenon causes cell resistance to increase with time, even at room temperature. As a result, the fixed-threshold-retention (FTR) raw-bit-error-rate (RBER) surpasses practical ECC correction ability within hours after being programmed. This study proposes a resistance drift compensation (RDC) scheme to mitigate R-drift issue. The proposed RDC scheme realizes PCM drift compensation and features RDC pulse to suppress ECC decoding failure. The proposed approach was validated using a 90-nm 128M cells PCM chip and an FPGA-based memory controller verification system. The MLC PCM FTR RBER has been suppressed by over 100×, thereby bringing it within ECC capability. The effectiveness of the RDC scheme was verified up to 106 cycles.},

title={Dynamic Waveform Shaping With Picosecond Time Widths}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={2}, 
pages={389-405}, 
abstract={In this paper, we present a scalable architecture in silicon that allows synthesis and dynamic waveform shaping of periodic mm-wave signals, either generated on-chip or quasi-optically through radiation in free space capable of producing pulse trains with picosecond time signatures. This is achieved through an architecture that allows extraction of multiple harmonics above fmax with simultaneous amplitude and phase control. Signal synthesis is achieved through controlled interference of multiple traveling waves with rich harmonic components and delays. The first example, presented in this paper, is where the signal synthesis is achieved on-chip demonstrating a pulse train at the output with a measured pulsewidth of 2.6 ps and a 0.46-mW output power. The second example is a four-element array with integrated antennas, which allows signal synthesis in space and is demonstrated to show reconfigurable radiation of pulse trains with a 2.6-ps pulsewidth, pure tones at a fundamental frequency of 107.5 GHz with an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 4.6 dBm and a second harmonic of 215 GHz with EIRP of 5.0 dBm, as well as any combination of these two harmonics with arbitrary amplitudes and delays. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper demonstrates the sharpest on-chip and radiated pulses with dynamic waveform shaping in any integrated circuit technology. This can open the door to innovations in broadband terahertz imaging, sensing, and spectroscopy.},

A complete equalization front end with per-path adaptation and per-sampler offset calibration enables 60-Gb/s operation over realistic channels. Current integration in the front end for energy-efficient equalization is combined with integration phase dithering to realize a robust baud-rate CDR. Correlation of the adaptive error sampler output with the phase dithering sequence indicates the direction of phase offset, and the resulting baud-rate CDR saves power and complexity compared to an oversampling CDR by not requiring additional clock phases/deserializers.

pages={1521-1541}, 
abstract={This paper presents several design techniques to widen the operating frequency range and increase the locking range of dynamic current-mode latch-based inductor-less millimeter-wave frequency dividers. A self-calibration technique is introduced to guarantee frequency locking over a wide frequency range with low-input amplitude and over process, voltage, and temperature variations, thereby optimizing power consumption and ensuring robustness. Three divide-by-four prototypes incorporating the aforementioned techniques are designed to cover a frequency range exceeding 16-67 GHz. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, the prototypes achieve min-average-max increases of 10%-47.5%-121.4% in fractional bandwidth over the state of the art. The first and third prototypes consume 3.7/6.2 mA (min/max) from a 1-V supply and achieve a figure of merit of 4.1/7.15 GHz/mW (min/max), while the second prototype consumes 3.9/6.7 mA (min/max) from a 1.1-V supply and achieves a figure of merit of 3/6.98 GHz/mW (min/max). The prototypes occupy the active areas of 11 × 42/11 × 53 μm2 (min/max). Finally, with the selfcalibration scheme, the dividers operate with input power less than -10 dBm, supply voltage variation of ±100 mV.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={2448-2462}, 
abstract={This paper presents an IC optimized to interface small-scaled electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters. The interface IC tracks the optimum conduction angle of the implemented active AC-DC input stage, enabling maximum power point tracking without the need for a system clock, harvester disconnection, or any external sensor. The optimum conduction angle tracking control nominally requires 815 nW. An energy buffer can autonomously be charged via the interface, employing a hysteretic input voltage-controlled inductive DC-DC boost converter, to 4.2 V for IC input powers between 2.6 μW and 1.2 mW with a peak power conversion efficiency of 95%. The 4.2 V is even reached when harvesting from weak vibrations of only 0.2 m/s2 acceleration peak amplitudes and input voltages of around 570 mV. Buffer charging with up to 91% of the maximal available harvester power is accomplished, and cold startup is enabled.

abstract={This paper introduces different classes of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture that non-uniformly samples the analog input and shifts from conventional voltage quantization to a hybrid quantization paradigm wherein both voltage and time quantization are utilized. In this architecture, the sampling rate adapts to the input frequency, which maintains an alias-free spectrum and enables an anti-aliasing (AA) filtering in the digital domain to relax the analog AA filter. In addition, the digital AA filter can generate uniform outputs from non-uniform samples to interact with the synchronous digital signal processor seamlessly and benefit from reconfigurability and technology scaling. To prove the concept, a flash-based non-uniform sampling ADC is proposed and the circuit non-idealities of key building blocks are analyzed. A silicon prototype is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS, which utilizes a 15-level voltage quantizer and a shared time quantizer with maximum resolution of 9 ps. Combined with the digital AA filter, it improves SNR by 30 dB in comparison with a conventional 4-bit uniformly sampled Nyquist-rate ADC and measures an EVM of -28 dB for a 64 quadrature amplitude modulation input signal under a 30-dB higher blocker.},

abstract={This paper presents an intrinsically linear wideband polar digital power amplifier (DPA) operating in semi class-E/F2 mode.

Measurement results of the fabricated prototype in 40-nm bulk CMOS show -46 and -40 dBc adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) for 20and 40-MHz orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, respectively. The measured error vector magnitudes (EVM) are -36 dB and -33 dB, respectively. Measured results indicate a PSAT, peak drain efficiency (DE), and power-added efficiency (PAE) of 14.6 dBm, 44%, and 26%, respectively, using a 0.5-V supply for the output stage at 2.2 GHz.},

abstract={A fully integrated CMOS power amplifier (PA) that efficiently generates high-voltage RF waveforms directly from a 4.8-V supply using only low-voltage thin-oxide transistors is introduced. High-voltage operation is achieved via implicit ~100% efficient dc-dc conversion enabled by stacking and flying individual class-D PA cells in a House-of-Cards (HoC) topology. By dynamically reconfiguring digitally controlled HoC slices to support different voltage conversion ratios and capacitively coupling their outputs, a Doherty-like high-efficiency backoff profile is achieved without using any magnetic impedance inverter. A test chip, implemented in 65-nm low-power CMOS, operates directly from 4.8 V using only 1.2-V transistors, and attains above 40% battery-to-RF efficiency at both 23-dBm peak power and at 6-dB backoff at 720 MHz. When applying a 10-MHz 16-quadrature amplitude modulation signal, the PA achieves an error vector magnitude of 3.6%-rms without using any predistortion techniques with an average output power and power-added efficiency of 15.7 dBm and 26.5%.},

title={A Fully Integrated Digital Low-Dropout Regulator Based on Event-Driven Explicit Time-Coding Architecture}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={11}, 
pages={3071-3080}, 
abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated digital low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator based on event-driven control architecture. The focus of the paper is to scale the off-chip output capacitor of an LDO conventionally used to compensate fast load current change. To shrink the output capacitor size, it is paramount to shorten control latency. This can be done by employing a high-speed error amplifier in analog LDO designs and by using fast clock in digital synchronous LDO designs. However, those approaches become less suitable for sub-1-V supply voltage due to the headroom problem of analog circuits and/or increase power dissipation due to the high-frequency clock. In this paper, we tackle the tradeoff between power consumption and control latency by introducing an event-driven approach. Our event-driven approach enables to perform regulation tasks only when the output voltage deviates significantly from a set point, simultaneously achieving short latency and low-power dissipation. We prototyped an eventdriven digital LDO that supports 400-μA load current at 0.5-V input and 0.45-V output voltage. The measurements show 40-mV droop voltage and 96.3% peak current efficiency with an on-chip integrated 0.4-nF output capacitor.},

abstract={This paper presents Gb/s-speed circuit building blocks in 32-nm CMOS SOI, for a > 20-Gb/s Cartesian direct-modulation W-band transmitter. Transmitter systems nonidealities and performance limitations are discussed, and circuit design techniques and analyses are presented. The transmitter employs two 2-b high-speed RF digital-to-analog converters driven in quadrature, 20-dB gain W-band LO drivers, and 30-Gb/s high-speed digital retimers and deserializers, and is capable of supporting BPSK/PAM4/QPSK/16-QAM modulation schemes, at a saturated output power Psat of +4 dBm. A maximum data rate of 20 Gb/s was achieved when operating in QPSK mode, 4 Gb/s in 16-QAM mode, and 12 Gb/s in both BPSK and PAM4 modes. The chip occupies 1.4×0.8 mm2, and consumes 110 mW in BPSK/PAM4 modes and 220 mW in QPSK and 16-QAM modes, resulting in the state-of-the-art 9-, 11-, and 55-pJ/b peak efficiencies, respectively. A mixer-first wideband W-band receiver that includes a passive mixer and a wideband transimpedance amplifier is also presented. Measurements of the receiver chip demonstrated its capability to downconvert and amplify highly complex modulated waveforms (> 256-QAM), and at high data rates, up to 60 Gb/s in 64-QAM, which proves the feasibility of building high dynamic range mm-wave receivers with bandwidth greater than 30 GHz. The receiver chip was also built in 32-nm CMOS SOI, occupying a core area of 0.18×0.1 mm2.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={1904-1914}, 
abstract={Ultra-low voltage operation is key to achieving energy-efficient operation for microcontroller (MCU) systems. Variation resiliency, high speed operation, and short design time are the most important challenges for these systems. This paper overcomes these challenges in a new design strategy that enables standard cell design with differential transmission gate logic. The commercial toolchain is extended with in-house developed add-ons and makes use of two custom libraries with different device lengths to allow high speed vs. low leakage trade-offs. The design flow is used to prototype two highly efficient 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 MCU systems in 40-nm CMOS. The core of the first prototype scales down to 190 mV and 0.8-MHz and reaches 16.07 pJ/cycle at 31.2-MHz and 440 mV. The second prototype benefits from the dual libraries and reduces core energy consumption by 50% at the same speed performance. Minimum energy operation is thus achieved at an even lower voltage (370 mV) with the M0 core consuming only 8.80 pJ/cycle at 13.7-MHz, breaking the sub-10-pJ/cycle barrier for a 6-35-MHz range.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={1}, 
pages={98-112}, 
abstract={Energy-efficient computing and ultralow-power computing are strong requirements for various application areas, such as internet of things and wearables. While for some applications integer and fixed-point arithmetic suffice, others require a larger dynamic range, typically obtained using floating-point (FP) numbers. Logarithmic number systems (LNSs) have been proposed as energy-efficient alternative, since several complex FP operations translate into simple integer operations. However, additions and subtractions become nonlinear operations, which have to be approximated via interpolation. Even efficient LNS units (LNUs) are still larger than standard FP units (FPUs), rendering them impractical for most general-purpose processors. We show that, when shared among several cores, LNUs become a very attractive solution. A series of compact LNUs is developed, which provide significantly more functionality (such as transcendental functions) than other state-of-the-art designs. This allows, for example, to evaluate the atan2 function with three instructions for only 183.2 pJ/op at 0.8 V. We present the first shared-LNU architecture where these LNUs have been integrated into a multicore system with four 32-b-OpenRISC cores and show measurement results demonstrating that the shared-LNU design can be up to 4.1× more energy-efficient in common nonlinear processing kernels, compared with a similar area design with four private FPUs.},

abstract={This paper proposes a multistage noise-shaping continuous-time sigma-delta modulator (CTΣΔM) with on-chip RC time constant calibration circuits, multiple feedforward interstage paths, and a fully integrated noise-cancellation filter (NCF). The core modulator architecture is a cascade of two singleloop second-order CTΣΔM stages, each of which consists of an integrator-based active-RC loop filter, current-steering feedback digital-to-analog converters, and a 4-b flash quantizer. On-chip RC time constant calibration circuits and high-gain multistage operational amplifiers are realized to mitigate quantization noise leakage due to process variation. Multiple feedforward interstage paths are introduced to: 1) synthesize a fourth-order noise transfer function with dc zeros; 2) simplify the design of NCF; and 3) reduce signal swings at the second-stage integrator outputs. Fully integrated in 40-nm CMOS, the prototype chip achieves 74.4 dB of signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR), 75.8 dB of signal-to-noise ratio, and 76.8 dB of dynamic range in 50.3 MHz of bandwidth (BW) at 1 GHz of sampling frequency with 43 mW of power consumption (P) from 1.1/1.15/2.5-V power supplies. It does not require external software calibration and possesses minimal out-of-band signal transfer function peaking. The figureof-merit (FOM), defined as FOM = SNDR + 10 × log10(BW/P), is 165.1 dB.},

Instead of relying on bulky external inductors with high quality factor as in the conventional parallel-synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (P-SSHI) approach, we propose a flipping-capacitor rectifier (FCR) topology to achieve voltage inversion of the piezoelectric energy harvester through a reconfigurable capacitor array. This fundamentally preserves a fully integrated solution without inductors while achieving a high-energy extraction capability. Measurement results from FCR1 using discrete components shows an output power enhancement of up to 3.4×, which is close to the theoretical prediction. We also fabricated a sevenphase FCR3 with four MIM capacitors and 21 switches using a 0.18-μm 1.8/3.3/6 V CMOS process, occupying an active area of ~1.7 mm2. Additionally, we implemented an active rectifier based on a common-gate comparator with phase alignment to ensure high-speed operation while minimizing the diode voltage drop. A phase generate-and-combine circuit eliminates redundant switching activities. Systematic optimization of the three main energy loss mechanisms during the finite flip time: 1) phase offset; 2) incomplete charge transfer; and 3) reduced conduction time, is also introduced. Measurement results show that the output power enhancement can reach up to 4.83× at an excitation frequency of 110 kHz.},

abstract={This paper presents a mixed-signal power amplifier (PA) with real-time hybrid Class-G and dynamic load trajectory manipulation (DLTM) operation that achieves PA efficiency enhancement into the deep power back-off (PBO) region. Moreover, we dynamically manipulate the PA load impedance trajectory that travels from the optimum output power (Pout) load impedance to the optimum efficiency load impedance during PBO, which creates PA PBO efficiency peaking. The introduced digitally intensive mixed-signal PA architecture enables precise and optimum real-time hybrid PA operation and ensures both PA output amplitude and phase accuracy. DLTM operation also extends the PA RF carrier bandwidth. A prototype PA is fully integrated in a standard 65-nm bulk CMOS process. Its load modulation network is realized by an on-chip compact transformer balun and two on-chip switch-controlled capacitors. The PA achieves +24.6-dBm (+24.4-dBm) peak Pout and 45.6% (45.8%) maximum drain efficiency (DE) at 2.4 GHz (2.8 GHz). DLTM operation extends the PA Pout and 1-dB bandwidth from 41.7% to 53.8%. By combining the real-time hybrid Class-G and DLTM operation with mixed-signal linearization, the PA delivers +17.6/+17.3-dBm (+17.3/+17-dBm) 10M-Sym/s 64QAM/256QAM at 2.4 GHz (2.8 GHz) with 27.5/26.7% (26.2/24.1%) DE, -29.2/-30.4-dB (-31.3/-31.5 dB) rms error vector magnitude (EVM), and -25.3/-25.1-dBc (-26.4/-26.1-dBc) adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR).

abstract={This paper presents a 28-GHz four-channel phased-array receiver in 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology for fifth-generation cellular application. The phased-array receiver employs scalar-only weighting functions within each receive path and then global quadrature power combining to realize beamforming. We discuss both the theory and nonidealities of this architecture and then circuit design details for our phased-array front-end prototype. Differential low-noise amplifiers and dual-vector variable-gain amplifiers are used to realize each front end in a compact area of 0.3 mm2. Across 4-b phase settings, each array element achieves 5.1-7 dB noise figure, -16.8 to -13.8 dBm input-referred 1-dB compression point, and -10.5 to -8.9 dBm input-referred third-order intercept point. The average gain per element is 10.5 dB at 29.7 GHz, whereas the 3-dB bandwidth is 24.5% (26.5-33.9 GHz). Root-mean-squared gain and phase errors are less than 0.6 dB and 5.4° across 28-32 GHz, respectively, and all four elements provide well-matched and well-isolated responses. Power consumption is 136 mW per element, equaling 546 mW for the four-element array.},

abstract={Broadband 0.03-1.1 THz signal generation and radiation are demonstrated based on an oscillator-free direct digital-to-impulse architecture with a 1.9-ps full width at half maximum and 130-GHz 3-dB bandwidth (BW) (200-GHz 10-dB BW) centered at 160 GHz. The radiated pulse achieves a peak pulse effective isotropic-radiated power of 19.2 dBm and peak pulse-radiated power of 2.6 mW. An ON/OFF impulse-shaping technique is introduced and implemented to suppress undesired ringing and to increase dc-to-radiated efficiency. The frequency-comb spectrum of the radiated pulse train with 5.2-GHz repetition rate is measured up to 1.1 THz. At a distance of 4 cm, the measured received SNR at 1 and 1.1 THz is 28 and 22 dB, respectively. A 1.1-THz tone is measured with a 10-dB spectral width of 2 Hz, demonstrating an extremely narrow spectral line width (two parts per trillion). Time-domain picosecond pulses are characterized using a custom femtosecond-laser-based terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system. Coherent spatial combining from two widely spaced chips is demonstrated. It is shown that the starting time of the radiated pulses is locked to the edge of the input digital trigger with a timing jitter of 270 fs. The chip is fabricated in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS process technology.},

abstract={A space-filling clock tree is presented, which takes an advantage of LC resonant clocking, to obtain a uniform phase and amplitude multiply-by-3 clock from a unique Sierpinski-coupled ring oscillator (SCRO) array. The three-stage interleaved SCROs resemble the Sierpinski triangle, and are synchronized with a common frequency to all. The SCRO further provides an aligned output phase relationship to reduce skew. The triangle clock grid with a side length of 3.2 mm is filled by a space-filling clock tree. The 3-D stacked transformers at the tree endpoints extract the third harmonic of the SCRO array oscillation and scale the voltage amplitude of the extracted clock. The transformers also perform a built-in bandpass filtering function to remove injected noise. An experimental prototype integrated in a 90-nm CMOS operates at 2.85-4.3 GHz and consumes 19.2-49 mW under 0.7-1 V supply voltages. With 300-mV added supply noise, jitter was measured as 3.4 ps (rms) and 17.7 ps (pp). The measured results reveal substantial improvements in both power and jitter from this approach.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

abstract={Closed-loop neuromodulation is essential for the advance of neuroscience and for administering therapy in patients suffering from drug-resistant neurological conditions. Neural stimulation generates large differential and commonmode (CM) artifacts at the recording sites, which easily saturate traditional recording front ends. This paper presents a neural recording chopper amplifier capable of handling in-band 80-mVpp differential artifacts and 650-mVpp CM artifacts while preserving the accompanying small neural signals. New techniques have been proposed that introduce immunity to CM interference, increase the input impedance of the chopper amplifier to 1.6 GQ, and increase the maximum realizable resistance of dutycycled resistors (DCR) to 90 GQ. These techniques enable our recording front-end to achieve a dynamic range of 74 dB (200 Hz- 5 kHz) and 81 dB (1-200 Hz). Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, the prototype occupies an area of 0.069 mm2/channel, and consumes 2.8 μW from a 1.2-V supply. The input-referred noise is 5.3 μVrms (200 Hz-5 kHz) and 1.8 μVrms (1-200Hz). The total harmonic distortion for a 40-mVp input at 1 kHz is -76 dB. This work improves the input impedance by 5.3× for chopped front-ends, linear-input range by 2×, maximum resistance of DCR by 32×, and tolerance to CM interferers by 6.5×, while maintaining comparable power and noise performance.},

It also achieves a 0.3% gain error and a 400-μA offset, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art systems. The heart of the system is a robust 260-μΩ shunt resistor made from the lead frame of a standard HVQFN plastic package. The resulting voltage drop is then digitized by a precision ΔΣ ADC and a bandgap reference (BGR). At the expense of current handling capability, a ±5-A version of the CSS uses a 10-mQ on-chip metal shunt to achieve just a 4-μA offset. Both designs are realized in a standard 0.13-μm CMOS process and draw 13 μA from a 1.5-V supply. Compensation of the spread and nonlinear temperature dependency of the shunt resistor Rshunt is accomplished by the use of a fixed polynomial master curve and a single room temperature calibration. This procedure also effectively compensates for the residual spread and nonlinearity of the ADC and the BGR.},

abstract={Effect of silicon technology limitations, including transistor nonidealities, layout parasitics, and low-quality factor on-chip passive components on millimeter wave stacked switching power amplifiers operating at the W-band frequencies (75-110 GHz), is presented in this paper. To mitigate the performance degradation in output power and PAE arising from such causes, high-breakdown voltage, high-fmax multiport stacked-transistor topologies are proposed for realizing power amplifiers with high output power and high efficiency at 75-110 GHz. A 90-nm silicon germanium (SiGe) BiCMOS process is used to propose active structures comprising of two and three stacked transistors with integrated layout parasitics that achieve fmax and breakdown voltage of 295 GHz and 8 V and 260 GHz and 11 V, respectively. Functionality of such multiport transistor topologies is demonstrated in proof-of-concept implementations, including a five-stage two-stacked switching power amplifier (PA) that achieves peak output power and PAE of 22 dBm and 19% at 85 GHz, and a six-stage three-stacked PA that achieves peak output power and PAE of 23.3 dBm and 17% at 83 GHz, respectively. For comparison with conventional switching PA designs using native transistor footprints, a five-stage W-band nonstacked Class-E amplifiers is also fabricated in the same 90-nm SiGe BiCMOS process with output power and PAE of 19.5 dBm and 16% at 88 GHz. The superior performance of output power and PAE in designs using the multiport transistor topologies highlights the benefit of the proposed approach.},

abstract={This paper presents a new fully digital architecture for an RF phase modulator with significantly improved phase resolution. The modulator utilizes 32 variable delay-lines in a delay-locked loop (DLL) configuration to provide 1-3 GHz operation with coarse 5-bit resolution. A 5-bit low-glitch multiplexer with accurate delay control on the control lines is used to select different taps of the DLL according to the baseband digital phase data to generate the desired phase modulated signal at the output. To further increase the effective resolution, a high speed 10-bit input, 5-bit output digital delta-sigma modulator (DSM) is added in front of the multiplexer. The DSM compensates for the phase truncation occurring in the 5-bit DLL. The impact of delay mismatch and phase offset in the DLL on the phase modulator output performance are studied. The phase modulator IC is implemented in 45-nm CMOS SOI and achieves <;2% rms EVM together with 55-dB rejection of close-to-carrier emissions for an 8-Mb/s GMSK signal at 2.3 GHz, with power consumption below 35 mW.},

abstract={This paper describes the design of a 25 Gb/s energy-efficient CMOS optical receiver with high input sensitivity. By incorporating a current-boosting preamplifier with a dual-path time-interleaved integrating-type optical receiver, it provides 1:2 demultiplexing operation with a tolerance to lower bandwidth photodiodes. The bandwidth of current amplifier is chosen as $0.35\times $ operating data rate for maximizing the receiver signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results show that the receiver can achieve 25 Gb/s operation when integrated with a 9 or 17 GHz GaAs photodiode. Input sensitivities in the two cases are -7.2 dBm (w/i a 9 GHz photodiode) and -10.8 dBm (w/i a 17 GHz photodiode), respectively, for a bit error rate of less than $10^{-12}$ . In addition, a single-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is embedded to compensate photodiode bandwidth and improve input sensitivity. Integrated with a low-cost 9 GHz photodiode, the input sensitivity and timing margin of the receiver are improved by 2 dB and 0.25 UI, respectively, after DFE compensation. By utilizing a current integrator and time-interleaved comparators, its energy efficiency is 1.13 pJ/b at 25 Gb/s under a 1.2 V power supply. Fabricated in a 40 nm bulk-CMOS technology, the core circuit occupies a chip area of 0.007 mm2 only.},

The LNA is interfaced to the detector through a low transformation ratio (i.e., high-impedance node) to achieve an efficient wideband signal transfer. The front end achieves both a low 1/f -noise corner and a low noise-equivalent power (NEP) by combining a large area, high resistive value load resistor together with a minimum size heterojunction bipolar transistor. At 56 GHz and optimum bias, the prototype provides a 61-MV/W responsivity which combined with a 194-nV/√Hz white noise level result in a 3.2-fW/√Hz NEP when the input power is modulated with a frequency above the 30-Hz flicker noise corner.

pages={2463-2474}, 
abstract={This paper introduces a multi-step switching scheme for a digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) that emerges as a new way of achieving nanosecond-transient and fine-grained on-chip voltage regulation. The multi-step switching scheme takes advantage of the adaptive pipeline control and asynchronous clocking for area- and power-efficient digital controller utilization. It speeds up the transient response by varying the pass transistor sizing in two available lengths of coarse steps as per the perturbation, while maintaining a small output voltage ripple by toggling in a finer step at steady operation. A prototype proving the proposed concept, i.e., a 0.6-1.0-V input, 50-200-mV dropout, and 500-mA maximum loading DLDO with an on-chip 1.5-nF output capacitor, is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process to verify the effectiveness of this scheme. By employing the multi-step switching scheme and adaptive control, the DLDO achieved a fast transient response to nanoseconds loading current change, and a 100 mV per 10-ns reference voltage switching, as well as a resolution of 768 levels (~9.5 bits) with a 5-mV output ripple. The quiescent current consumed by this DLDO at steady operation is down to 300 μA .},

abstract={This paper introduces a high-order continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) that applies digital-domain noise coupling (DNC) based on the structural advantages of the successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which makes the implementation of second-order noise coupling very simple. Due to digital-domain implementation as well as the SAR ADC where the key building blocks are embedded for the proposed DNC, compact size and efficient power consumption could be designed. For low circuit noise, a feedback DAC is implemented with a tri-level current-steering DAC. Tri-level data-weight averaging (TDWA) improves the linearity of the DAC. With the proposed DNC and TDWA, a prototype CT DSM fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS achieves a peak 74.4-dB SNDR and an 80.8-dB dynamic range (DR) for a 10-MHz BW with an oversampling ratio of 16, resulting in a Schreier FoMDR of 174.5 dB. The chip area occupies 0.1 mm², and the power consumption is 4.2 mW.},

abstract={This paper presents a highly digital, 0-1 MASH capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC). The CDC works by sampling a reference voltage on the sensing capacitor and then quantizing the charge stored in it by a 9-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter. The residue is fed to a ring voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) ΔΣ and quantized in time domain. The outputs from the two stages are combined to produce a quantized output with the first-order noise shaping. The proposed two-stage architecture reduces the impact of the VCO's nonlinearity. A digital calibration technique is used to track the VCO's gain across process, voltage, and temperature. The absence of any operational amplifier and low oversampling ratio for the VCO results in high energy efficiency. A prototype CDC in a 40-nm CMOS process achieves a 64.2-dB SNR while operating from a 1-V supply and using a sampling frequency of 3 MHz. The prototype achieves a CDC figure of merit of 55 fJ/conversion-step.},

abstract={A new multiple-loop design technique for high-performance low-dropout (LDO) regulator designs has been proposed and successfully implemented in many commercial products for portable smart phone and tablet PC applications. The proposed LDO is composed of five loops that allows designers to obtain a good tradeoff between quiescent current and other performances, such as undershoot, overshoot, and so on. A total of one bandgap reference and 38 LDOs (including n-type and p-type LDOs, which will be named NLDO and PLDO, respectively) were integrated in one power-management IC chip for powering an application processor inside mobile devices. The proposed LDO has been fabricated based on 0.13-μm CMOS process and supplies various current capacities from 50 to 600 mA; 38 LDOs have been designed and supply different output voltage levels from 0.7 to 3.0 V. One of the proposed NLDOs consumes 14 μA of the quiescent current and features under 56/24 mV of undershoot/overshoot at VOUT = 1V as the load current steps up from 0 to 300 mA with 300 mA/1 μs on a 1-μF output capacitor. The measured output load and line regulations are 1.8 and 0.4 mV, respectively. The measured integrated output noise from 10 Hz to 100 kHz at ILOAD = 10% of maximum current shows 80 μVrms.

abstract={This paper presents a body-coupled communication (BCC) transceiver (TRX) that mitigates all the practical impairments of the body channel at once. The proposed pseudo orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (P-OFDM) TRX combines baseband BPSK-OFDM with frequency-shift keying (FSK) to alleviate the impacts of variable ground effect and variable skin-electrode contact impedance, which have been the two major issues on the BCC. It can tolerate up to 20 dB of channel gain variation with measured bit error rate improvement of >70% compared to FSK modulation alone. The RC relaxed contact impedance monitor continuously monitors and compensates the variable skin-electrode contact impedance at both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The proposed power-gated 8-point inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform with no floating-point multipliers (FPMs) reduces the gate count and power by 54% and 30% compared to conventional FPMs, respectively. Additionally, the simple floating-point adder (FPA) reduces the gate count and energy consumption by 34% and 20% compared to conventional FPAs, respectively. A high input impedance glitch-free FSK demodulation RX with variable threshold limiter and all digital cycle correction is also proposed to support a scalable data rate (200 Kbps-2 Mbps). The 0.54 mm2 TRX in 65-nm CMOS consumes 1.1 mW.},

A hybrid impedance control scheme is presented where the total number of driver slices is used for coarse impedance control, and analog loop-based voltage control is used for fine impedance control of the TX. A finite-impulse response compensation circuit to compensate for the data dependent current due to equalization is also presented. The TX consumes 120.8 mW with 0.9- and 1.2-V supplies, provides 0.25-0.9 Vpp output swing, and achieves total jitter of 6.49 ps-pp and random jitter of 220 fs-rms at 32.75 Gb/s with bit error rate of 1e-12.},

abstract={A 0.065-mm2 single-channel calibration-free 12-b analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling at 600 MS/s in 28-nm ultrathin body bias fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) is presented. The selected hybrid architecture, incorporating pipelined and asynchronous successive approximation register ADC, demonstrates advantages and suitability of different design techniques utilizing forward body bias (FBB) capability of FD-SOI. Using an FBB voltage range of 0-1.8 V has enabled an signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) improvement of more than 9 dB. An integrated body bias generator ensures the required voltages for FBB. This paper demonstrates 61.5-dB and 60.7-dB SNDR at low and Nyquist input frequency, respectively, at 600-MS/s sampling frequency. The Walden FoM of 37.2 fJ/conv-step and Schreier FoM of 162.5 dB at 600 MS/s are achieved in Nyquist conditions. Speed robustness of the architecture has been demonstrated by achieving 57-dB SNDR at 800MS/s, >50-dB SNDR up to 950 MS/s, and 58.5-dB SNDR till 500-MHz input frequency at 600 MS/s.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={1399-1411}, 
abstract={Design techniques to improve energy efficiency of serial link transceivers are presented. Power consumption is reduced by using: low-power clock generation, recovery, and distribution schemes; charge-based circuits to implement analog front-end and samplers/flip-flops; and a partially segmented voltage-mode (VM) output driver. An LC-oscillator based digital phase-locked loop (PLL) is used to generate a low jitter clock that is shared between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). The clock recovery unit uses a local ring-oscillator based PLL to reduce the number of phase interpolators and the amount of high-frequency clock distribution. Charge-based samplers that were shown to operate with limited return-to-zero voltage swings and consume only dynamic power are modified to provide non-return-to-zero outputs and used extensively in the deserializer and Rx front-end circuits. A partially segmented VM output driver with embedded 2-tap de-emphasis is proposed to reduce power consumption of pre-drivers. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the 14 Gb/s transceiver prototype employs aforementioned techniques and achieves an energy efficiency of 2.8 mW/Gb/s. The Tx achieves a phase margin of 0.36 UI (BER = 10-12) at the end of an 11 dB loss channel with an energy efficiency of 0.89 mW/Gb/s. The Rx recovers clock with 1.8 psrms long term absolute jitter at BER <; 10-12 and achieves an energy efficiency of 1.69 mW/Gb/s. The LC-oscillator based digital PLL achieves an integrated jitter of 0.605 psrms with an energy efficiency of 0.5 mW/GHz at 7 GHz output frequency.},

A de-multiplexed wordline interleaving scheme is presented to compensate for bitcell area overhead. The interleaving technique achieves 9% reduction in decoder area and 50% reduction in clock load within the decoder. A sense amplifier circuit with reduced sensitivity to process variations is proposed to further enhance the reliability of the differential read-out.

abstract={Counterfeiting is a major issue plaguing global supply chains. In order to mitigate this problem, a wireless authentication tag is presented that implements a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and authenticated encryption modes. The tag uses Keccak, the cryptographic core of SHA3, to update keys before each protocol invocation, limiting side-channel leakage. Power-glitch attacks are mitigated through state backup on ferroelectric capacitor-based nonvolatile flip-flops with a fully integrated energy backup storage, which needs a 2.2× smaller area compared with conventional approaches. The 130 nm CMOS tag harvests wireless power through a 433 MHz inductive link and communicates with a reader by a pulse-based modulation that minimizes the wireless power dead time. The proposed regulating voltage multiplier simultaneously rectifies, boosts, and regulates a >0.55 V ac input to a 1.5 V supply voltage with <;1.1% line and load regulation while requiring only one on-chip decoupling capacitor. The bidirectional data telemetry operates at 125 kb/s, while requiring 4% (downlink) and 6.25% (uplink) duty cycles. Full system operation including the tag, reader, and server protocol is demonstrated in the presence of worst-case power interruption events.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={1703-1718}, 
abstract={High-capacity wireless links at millimeter-Waves are candidate for backhaul infrastructure to small-cell mobile networks. However, the use of high-order modulation schemes sets challenging phase-noise specifications for integrated frequency synthesizers. Moreover, the use of adaptive modulation suggests local oscillators exploiting noise scaling, up to several decibel depending on channel conditions. In this paper, multi-core switch-coupled LC voltage-controlled oscillators are proposed to achieve ultra-low phase noise and scalable noise performance according to system requirements in a power-efficient way. A theoretical model investigating the effect of LC core component mismatches shows very good agreement with experiments. Design insights are provided, key in order to take effective advantage from the proposed low-noise technique. A quad-core ~20 GHz oscillator prototype, followed by a frequency quadrupler, has been realized in 55-nm BiCMOS technology. Measured performances are ~70-to-81 GHz frequency range with -106.5-dBc/Hz minimum phase noise at 1-MHz offset from an 80-GHz carrier with 50-mW power consumption and 1.2-V supply. To authors' knowledge, this is the lowest phase noise measured in the E-Band using integrated technologies and CMOS-compatible supplies. When noise requirements are relaxed, auxiliary cores are turned off rising phase noise by 6 dB but with power consumption reduced down to 18 mW only.},

Leveraging the proposed design methodologies, the E-band LNA achieves a figure of merit ≈10.5-dB better than state-of-the-art designs in the same band and comparable to LNAs at lower frequencies. The RX achieves 30.8-dB conversion gain with <;1-dB in-band ripple over a 27.5-GHz BW-3-dB while demonstrating a 7.3-dB minimum NF with less than 2-dB variation from 61.4 to 88.9-GHz.

abstract={A precision-scalable processor for low-power ConvNets or convolutional neural networks is implemented in a 40-nm CMOS technology. To minimize energy consumption while maintaining throughput, this paper is the first to implement dynamic precision and energy scaling and exploit the sparsity of convolutions in a dedicated processor architecture. The processor's 256 parallel processing units achieve a peak 102 GOPS running at 204 MHz and 1.1 V. It is fully C-programmable through a custom generated compiler and consumes 25-287 mW at 204 MHz and a scaling efficiency between 0.3 and 2.7 effective TOPS/W. It achieves 47 frames/s on the convolutional layers of the AlexNet benchmark, consuming only 76 mW. This system hereby outperforms the state-of-the-art up to five times in energy efficiency.},

abstract={A 170-GHz fully integrated single-chip heterodyne frequency modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) imaging radar using a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology (fT/fmax = 220/280 GHz) is reported. This system demonstrates a wide bandwidth of 27.5 GHz (16.3%) at a center frequency of 168 GHz. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. A co-design of the VCO, coupler, and antenna is performed to minimize the chip area and the dc power consumption. The transmitter radiates a peak power of -1 dBm with a dc-to-RF efficiency of 1.42%. At the receiver side, a subharmonic mixer is used for signal downconversion. The system achieves a measured sensitivity of 87 fW with a total dc power consumption of 67 mW. The prototype is capable of forming 2-D and 3-D images with a range resolution of 7 mm. To the best of our knowledge, this fully integrated imaging radar demonstrates the highest sensitivity and radiation efficiency among all imaging systems around 200 GHz. Moreover, the system is capable of practical 2-D and 3-D imaging with significantly lower dc power consumption compared to the state-of-the-art FMCW radars.},

abstract={It is getting mandatory to comply with ISO26262 in the recent automotive development. The implementation of safety mechanism to detect faults is one of the keys in ISO26262. The fault prediction will make the automotive system more reliable. The SoC in this paper introduces two features: hardware built-in self-test (BIST) for safety mechanism supporting automotive safety integrity level (ASIL) B and killer-droop monitor for fault prediction. In addition, time slicing is introduced to the testing with hardware BIST during runtime so that each test session can be shorter than the required interrupt response time in the application. The killer-droop monitor can predict the voltage droop and stop the clock supply for a certain period of time to mitigate the droop for preventing delay faults on the SoC. The monitor samples the voltage based on time-to-digital converter at CPU operation clock and predicts the voltage from the history of sampled voltage. With that prediction feature, the minimum operation voltage can be improved by 50 mV at 2.02 GHz CPU operation, and the maximum frequency can be improved by 140 MHz under 0.82 V power supply in 16 nm process.},

pages={1443-1449}, 
abstract={This paper presents a subthreshold voltage reference in which the output voltage is scalable depending on the number of stacked PMOS transistors. A key advantage is that its output voltage can be higher than that obtained with conventional low-power subthreshold voltage references. The proposed reference uses native NMOS transistors as a current source and develops a reference voltage by stacking one or more PMOS transistors. The temperature coefficient of the reference voltage is compensated by setting the size ratio of the native NMOS and stacked pMOS transistors to cancel temperature dependence of transistor threshold voltage and thermal voltage. Also, the transistor size is determined considering the trade-off between diode current between n-well and p-sub and process variation. Prototype chips are fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process. Measurement results from three wafers show 3σ inaccuracy of ±1.0% from 0 °C to 100 °C after a single room-temperature trim. The proposed voltage reference achieves a line sensitivity of 0.31%/V and a power supply rejection of -41 dB while consuming 35 pW from 1.4 V at room temperature.},

volume={52},

pages={1111-1122}, 
abstract={A cognitive tri-band transmitter (TX) with a forwarded clock using multiband signaling and high-order digital signal modulations is presented for serial link applications. The TX features learning an arbitrary channel response by sending a sweep of continuous wave, detecting power level at the receiver side, and then adapting modulation scheme, data bandwidth, and carrier frequencies accordingly based on detected channel information. The supported modulation scheme ranges from nonreturn to zero/Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) to Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) 16/256-Quadrature amplitude modulation(QAM). The proposed highly reconfigurable TX is capable of dealing with low-cost serial channels, such as low-cost connectors, cables, or multidrop buses with deep and narrow notches in the frequency domain (e.g., a 40-dB loss at notches). The adaptive multiband scheme mitigates equalization requirements and enhances the energy efficiency by avoiding frequency notches and utilizing the maximum available signal-to-noise ratio and channel bandwidth. The implemented TX prototype consumes a 14.7-mW power and occupies 0.016 mm2 in a 28-nm CMOS. It achieves a maximum data rate of 16 Gb/s with forwarded clock through one differential pair and the most energy efficient figure of merit of 20.4 μW/Gb/s/dB, which is calculated based on power consumption of transmitting per gigabits per second data and simultaneously overcoming per decibel worst case channel loss within the Nyquist frequency.},

year={2017}, 
volume={PP}, 
number={99}, 
pages={1-10}, 
abstract={On-die supply-voltage droops attributed to workload variations degrade the performance of high-performance microprocessors. An adaptive-clocking-control circuit was implemented for mitigating the adverse impact of supply-voltage droops on processor performance. One of the most critical requirements for adaptive-clocking supply-droop mitigation is that clock-frequency adaptation is fast enough to respond to such supply droops. To shorten the clock-frequency-adaptation latency, therefore, the adaptive-clocking-control circuit features the following schemes: the time-to-digital converter (TDC) based on multipath delay line (multipath TDC), thermometer-code-based data-processing logic, and phase-locked loop (PLL) including a direct frequency-reduction mechanism. The multipath TDC reduces quantization errors in droop detection to shorten detection-response latency. The thermometer-code-based logic does not cost extra clock cycles compared with binary-code-based logic. The direct frequency-reduction mechanism enables a PLL to quickly react to clock-modulation instruction without any intervals. These schemes contribute to faster clock-frequency-adaptation response to supply droops. A test chip including the adaptive-clocking-control circuit with SPARC processor cores was fabricated in a 20-nm CMOS process. Experimental measurements indicate that the adaptive-clocking-control circuit achieved a state-of-the-art frequency gain of 7.5%, resulting in an operating frequency as high as 5 GHz.},

abstract={An all-pass filter architecture that can be generalized to high orders, and can be realized using active circuits is proposed. Using this, a compact true-time-delay element with a widely tunable delay and a large delay-bandwidth product (DBW) is demonstrated. This is useful for beamforming and equalization in the lower GHz range where the use of LC or transmission line-based solutions to realize large delays is infeasible. Coarse tuning of delay is realized by changing the filter's order while keeping the bandwidth constant and fine tuning is implemented by changing the filter's bandwidth utilizing the delay-bandwidth tradeoff. A test chip fabricated in 0.13 μm CMOS process demonstrates a delay tuning range of 250 ps-1.7ns, over a bandwidth of 2 GHz, while maintaining a magnitude deviation of ±0.7 dB. The filter achieves a DBW of 3.4 and a delay per unit area of 5.8 ns/mm2. The filter has a worst case noise figure of 23 dB, and -40 dB intermodulation (IM3) distortion for 37 mVppd inputs. The chip occupies an active area of 0.6 mm2, and dissipates 112 mW-364 mW of power between its minimum and maximum delay settings.

abstract={This paper presents a 2-GS/s 8-bit 16× time-interleaved (TI) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for a millimeter-wave pulsed radar baseband system-on-chip (SoC). To suppress sampling timing errors among sub-ADCs, a foreground timing-skew calibration technique with small additional circuits is proposed. Measured spurious-free dynamic range and signal-to-noise distortion ratio at 1-GHz full Nyquist is, therefore, enhanced by 16 and 11 dB, respectively. Unlike conventional calibration techniques based on redundant ADCs or complicated digital calculations, additional circuit components are only several small resistors and a capacitor, resulting in only 0.4% area penalty. This area saving enables the compact integration of the radar baseband SoC with digital beamforming, where eight-channel TI-ADCs occupy the dominant chip area otherwise. Even though this is foreground, no system performance is sacrificed because the calibration sequence is closed loop and fast enough to be executed during an existing calibration interval in a periodic beam transmission sequence. The TI-ADCs are embedded on industrial SoC in a 40-nm CMOS process. The power consumption including the input buffer and the reference buffer is 54.2 mW from a 1.1-V supply, and figure of merit is 355 fJ/conversion step.},

pages={2362-2373}, 
abstract={Long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is an important tool used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Truly Wearable EEG can be considered as the future of ambulatory EEG units, which are the current standard for long-term EEG monitoring. Replacing these short lifetime, bulky units with long-lasting miniature and wearable devices which can be easily worn by patients will result in more EEG data being acquired for longer monitoring periods. This paper presents an analog-based data reduction integrated circuit that would reduce the amount of power required to transmit EEG data by identifying the sections of data that are interesting for diagnostic purposes while discarding the background activity. Using the data reduction system as part of a miniature wireless, EEG monitoring unit would yield significant reductions in power consumption since the transmitter will only be switched ON based on the data reduction system output.

abstract={Isolators are used to eliminate ground loops, and also to protect circuits that are sensitive to high voltages. Optoisolators are normally deployed for these purposes, but they suffer from several limitations, such as low speed of operation and temperature instability. In this paper, an ON-OFF keying (OOK) transmitter (TX) is designed so as to emulate and serve as an alternative to optoisolators, without significant changes to the rest of the system. The TX primarily consists of a voltage clamp circuit to convert input current into voltage, a discharge circuit to avoid metastability, and a 300-700-MHz spread-spectrum (SS) oscillator. The start-up and die-down times of the oscillator are optimized for maximum data speed. SS modulation of the oscillator output restricts radiative emissions to within permissible limits. The TX derives power from the input data (current) signal itself, thereby operating without any external power supply, and supports speeds of up to 50 Mb/s. The TX was fabricated in a BiCMOS semiconductor process and tested using an OOK receiver.},

The modulator introduces a third-order filter implemented with a lossless integrator and a multiple-feedback single-amplifier biquadratic filter with embedded loop stability compensation. An active summing block is implemented by employing a common-gate current buffer followed by a transimpedance amplifier. This combination relaxes the specification requirements of the operational amplifier by making its required BW independent of the closed-loop gain. The proposed technique achieves optimum BW with reduced power consumption, making it functional for over gigahertz operation. Fabricated in a standard 40-nm CMOS technology, and clocked at 3.2 GHz, the CTΣΔM achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 65.5 dB over 75-MHz BW while consuming 22.8 mW of power.

abstract={In this paper, we present a two-stage, four-way combined power amplifier (PA) operating in the 27-31-GHz frequency range in 180-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The output network of the PA employs spiral transformers and a microstrip T-combiner to realize low-loss two-way series, two-way parallel power combining. With the help of a lumped-element transformer model, we present a co-optimization technique for the transformer and the adjoining matching components to minimize the power loss of the full output network. The design methodology is applicable for realizing an arbitrary impedance at the device plane with a K-way series, M-way parallel combiner. The efficacy of this technique is demonstrated by the realization of a PA, which has 27.6-dB gain, 23.2-dBm, 1-dB compressed output power, 32.7% power-added efficiency (PAE) at 1-dB compression, and 15% PAE at 6-dB back off.

abstract={The next generations of large-scale data-centers and supercomputers demand optical interconnects to migrate to 400G and beyond. Microring modulators in silicon-photonics VLSI chips are promising devices to meet this demand due to their energy efficiency and compatibility with dense wavelength division multiplexed chip-to-chip optical I/O. Higher order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) schemes can be exploited to mitigate their fundamental energy-bandwidth tradeoff at the system level for high data rates. In this paper, we propose an optical digital-to-analog converter based on a segmented microring resonator, capable of operating at 20 GS/s with improved linearity over conventional optical multi-level generators that can be used in a variety of applications such as optical arbitrary waveform generators and PAM transmitters. Using this technique, we demonstrate a PAM-4 transmitter that directly converts the digital data into optical levels in a commercially available 45-nm SOI CMOS process. We achieved 40-Gb/s PAM-4 transmission at 42-fJ/b modulator and driver energies, and 685-fJ/b total transmitter energy efficiency with an area bandwidth density of 0.67 Tb/s/mm2. The transmitter incorporates a thermal tuning feedback loop to address the thermal and process variations of microrings' resonance wavelength. This scheme is suitable for system-on-chip applications with a large number of I/O links, such as switches and general-purpose and specialized processors in large-scale computing and storage systems.},

pages={3361-3372}, 
abstract={This paper describes the design and implementation of a 220-320 GHz spectrometer consisting of a pair of 65-nm CMOS chips. The spectrometer utilizes two counterpropagating frequency-comb signals to seamlessly scan the broadband spectrum and significantly reduces the total scanning time through high parallelism. The comb signal, with ten equally spaced frequency tones, is generated and detected by a chain of inter-locked transceivers on chip. The large reduction of required tuning range for each transceiver enables peak energy efficiency across a wide bandwidth. Each transceiver is based on a multi-functional electromagnetic structure, which serves as a frequency doubler, sub-harmonic mixer and an on-chip radiator simultaneously. In particular, theory and design methodology of a dual-transmission-line feedback scheme are presented, which maximizes the transistor gain near its cutoff frequency fmax and enhances the harmonic generation efficiency. The spectrometer chip has a measured total radiated power of 5.2 mW and a measured single-sideband noise figure of 14.6 ~ 19.5 dB, representing the highest generated power and sensitivity of silicon-based terahertz circuits. The chip consumes a dc power of 1.7 W. Finally, absorption spectrum of acetonitrile (CH3CN) and carbonyl sulfide is obtained, which agree with the JPL spectroscopy catalog.},

The AMS blocks excite the main VCOs to operate in two distinct frequency bands. An overlap between the two frequency bands has extended the tuning range of the VCO. By turning the AMS blocks off, low-loss and low-capacitance behaviors of these blocks result in wide tuning range and high harmonic output power at high millimeter-wave frequencies. On the other hand, by turning the AMS blocks on, their loss-canceling and capacitance-tuning behaviors yield to higher power and wider tuning range with a lower center frequency. By having sufficient frequency overlap between the two modes, the implemented VCO achieves record tuning range of 20.7% at 190.5 GHz with a maximum output power of -2.1 dBm. This tuning range is significantly higher than reported silicon-based VCOs with center frequencies higher than 120 GHz.},

pages={2242-2255}, 
abstract={This paper describes a multi-purpose radar system suitable for applications with different requirements on dynamic range, resolution, and miniaturization degree. It utilizes a scalable sensor platform that includes a wideband 30.5-GHz voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as well as 61- and 122-GHz transceivers (TRXs) in a silicon-germanium BiCMOS technology. The proposed architecture enables the cascading of multiple TRXs and allows the implementation of MIMO radar systems in two different frequency bands by using a single VCO. The higher transmit output power of 11.5 dBm as well as receive gain of 24 dB make the 61-GHz TRX suitable for applications requiring a high dynamic range. The lower wavelength allows the integration of on-chip antennas in the 122-GHz TRX and enables, thus, a high miniaturization degree. The higher LO scaling factor makes the 122-GHz TRX also more attractive for high-resolution applications. A sweep bandwidth of 2.5 GHz generated by the VCO is scaled up to 10 GHz and results in a range resolution of 3 cm. The proposed TRXs are equipped with binary phase shift keying modulators as well as an I/Q receiver and can be utilized to build a flexible software-defined radar platform for range and distant-selective vibration sensors utilizing frequency-modulated continuous wave as well as pseudo-random noise radar techniques.},

abstract={Reducing the operating voltage of digital systems improves energy efficiency, and the minimum operating voltage of a system (Vmin) is commonly limited by SRAM bitcells. Common techniques to lower SRAM Vmin focus on using circuit-level periphery-assist techniques to prevent bitcell failures at low voltage. Alternatively, this paper proposes architecture-level techniques to allow caches to tolerate significant numbers of failing bitcells at low voltage while maintaining correct operation. The presented processor lowers SRAM-based cache Vmin using three architectural techniques-bit bypass, dynamic column redundancy, and line disable-that use low-overhead reprogrammable redundancy (RR) to increase the maximum tolerable bitcell failure rate and decrease the minimum operating voltage in processor caches. In a fabricated 28-nm RISC-V-based processor chip, these RR techniques add 2% area overhead to the cache and reduce the Vmin of the 1-MB L2 cache by 25%, resulting in a 49% power reduction.},

Duty cycle control is used to operate for the low input power that cannot provide the demanded output power.

abstract={In this paper, we proposed and designed a digitally configured versatile RF quadrature transmitter. The transmitter efficiency was enhanced by IQ cell sharing and the deactivation of cells of opposite phases. In simulation, these techniques were able to increase the average efficiency of the transmitter from 46.3% to 70.7% for a 6.9-dB PAPR LTE signal. Moreover, the number of power amplifying cells was halved, improving the total efficiency of the transmitter. The proposed transmitter was implemented in a 6-b configuration at 0.8 GHz using a 28-nm CMOS process. Furthermore, the performance of the transmitter was verified. The dynamic range of the measured output power was in the range -20.2 to 13.9 dBm, and the measured average output power was 6.97 dBm for the 6.9-dB PAPR LTE signal.

abstract={This paper presents a low-power 39.25-MHz crystal oscillator with a new stacked-amplifier architecture achieving the smallest figure of merit (FoM) ever reported for a crystal oscillator for wireless communications. Theoretical analyses of the power consumption and the phase noise (PN) in the proposed stacked-amplifier architecture are newly provided to clarify the reason why the proposed stacked-amplifier architecture achieves the smallest FoM. Additionally, a new self-forward-body-biasing technique and flicker noise suppression technique are shown to reduce the minimum operational supply voltage (VDD(MIN)) and the PN, respectively. The proposed 3.3-V, 39.25-MHz stackedamplifier crystal oscillator fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process exhibits the smallest FoM for a crystal oscillator of -248 dBc/Hz with a power consumption of 19 μW and PN of -139 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset frequency. The relative frequency errors among 11 samples at temperatures of -30 °C to 80 °C and for ±10% supply voltage variation are ±10.5 ppm and ±0.12 ppm, respectively. The long-term frequency error is -0.98 ppm in the first year (=365 days).},

title={5.6 Mb/mm $^{2}$ 1R1W 8T SRAM Arrays Operating Down to 560 mV Utilizing Small-Signal Sensing With Charge Shared Bitline and Asymmetric Sense Amplifier in 14 nm FinFET CMOS Technology},

abstract={Multiported high-performance on-die memories occupy significantly more die area than a comparable single-port memory. Among various multiport memory topologies, the 1-read (R), 1-write (W) 8-transistor (T) Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) with a decoupled read port allows separate optimization of the read and write ports when organized without interleaved logical columns. This enables a lower minimum operating voltage (Vmin) compared with other dual-port SRAMs that require ports optimized for read stability and write operations. However, the 1R1W 8T SRAM often employs large signal, hierarchical bitline sensing to achieve high performance due to the nondifferential read bitline. This large-signal read architecture necessitates frequently placed local bitline sensing circuits, degrading the array bit density. In this paper, we present two sense amplifier (SA) techniques for small-signal pseudodifferential sensing to facilitate 256 bits per bitline achieving an 8T SRAM array density of 5.6 Mb/mm2 in 14 nm FinFET CMOS. The first design employs a charge sharing SA scheme to generate a reference voltage (VREF) by leveraging the capacitance of otherwise unused metal tracks over the bitcell column. The second design utilizes an asymmetric SA in which the read bitline precharged to VCC in the unselected sector acts as a reference voltage and the active bitline side is intentionally upsized to skew the SA. High volume measurement results demonstrate 560 mV Vmin at 400 MHz/-10 °C and reaches 2.21 GHz at 1 V supply.},

abstract={This paper presents a precision CMOS temperature-to-digital converter (TDC), which senses the temperature-dependent base-emitter voltage of substrate PNPs. Measurements on 20 samples from one batch show that it achieves an inaccuracy of ±60 mK (3σ) from -55 °C to +125°C, after a single room-temperature trim. This state-of-the-art result is mainly due to the extensive use of dynamic error cancellation techniques to generate the PNP's collector currents, thus minimizing the spread in their base-emitter voltages, together with a digital PTAT trim to correct for the spread in the PNP's saturation currents. The effect of process variation on the TDC's inaccuracy was investigated by measuring 80 samples from three different batches. Using the same calibration parameters, they exhibit a maximum untrimmed inaccuracy of ±2°C (3σ) from -55°C to +125°C. This drops to ±100 mK (3σ) after a single point trim. The proposed TDC thus reduces calibration costs by obviating the need for batch-specific calibration parameters, which would otherwise require the multipoint calibration of several samples. The effect of the PNP's current gain β was also investigated with the help of a novel β-detection circuit. Implemented in 0.16-μm CMOS, the TDC occupies 0.16 mm2 and draws 4.6 μA from 1.5 to 2 V supply voltages. It achieves a resolution Figure of Merit of 7.8 pJ°C2, and a state-of-the-art supply sensitivity of 0.01°C/V.},

abstract={This paper proposes a transformer-based broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA) for millimeter-wave application. The proposed LNA has four common-source stages. Three transformers are used to connect the drains of the former transistors and the sources of the following transistors to boost the transconductances of the following transistors. Thus, the gain of the circuit is effectively increased. In addition, the noise figure (NF) is decreased because the noise contributions of the following stages are further suppressed by the application of the transformers. To enhance the gain bandwidth, the gate inductor in each inter-stage matching network is independently adjusted to separate the main poles of the four stages. The LNA is demonstrated using a commercial 65-nm CMOS process. According to the measurement results, a maximum gain of 17.7 GHz at 67 GHz and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 35.6 GHz are achieved. The measured NF is 5.4-7.4 dB at 54-67 GHz. The tested input 1-dB gain compression point (IP1dB) ranges from -15.4 to -11.7 dBm in the entire 3-dB gain bandwidth. With 1-V power supply, the LNA consumes 19-mA dc current. The chip size is only 0.37 mm2 with all pads.},

pages={2055-2070}, 
abstract={An N-path switched-capacitor (SC) gain loop is proposed as an area-efficient surface acoustic wave-less wireless transceiver (TXR) for multiband TDD communications. Unlike the direct-conversion transmitter (TX: baseband (BB) filter → I/Q modulation → PA driver) and receiver (RX: LNA → I/Q demodulation → BB Filter) that the functions are arranged in an open-loop style, here the signal amplification, bandpass filtering, and I/Q (de)modulation are unified in a closed-loop formation, being reconfigurable as a TX or RX with a local oscillator (LO)defined center frequency. The key advantages are the multiband operation capability in the TX mode, and high resilience to outof-band (OB) blockers in the RX mode. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS, the TXR prototype consumes up to 38.4 mW (20 mW) in the TX (RX) mode at the 1.88-GHz long-term evolution (LTE)band2. The LO-defined center frequency covers 80% of the TDD-LTE bands with neither on-chip inductors nor external input-matching components. By properly injecting (extracting) the signals into (from) the N-path SC gain loop, the TX mode achieves an -1 dBm output power, a -40 dBc ACLREUTRA1, and a 2% EVM at 1.88 GHz, while showing a -154.5 dBc/Hz OB noise at 80-MHz offset. In the RX mode, a 3.2-dB noise figure and a +8 dBm OB-IIP3 are measured. The active area (0.038 mm2) of the TXR is 24× smaller than the state-of-the-art LTE solutions.},

abstract={A 40-56 Gb/s PAM-4 receiver with ten-tap decision-feedback equalization (DFE) targeting chip-to-module and board-to-board cable interconnects is designed in 16-nm FinFET.

The h1 feedback signals are directly tapped from the master latch output of the StrongArm-based slicers. A CMOS amplifier with delayed pre-charge release is used to boost and pre-condition the h1 feedback signals before being applied to current-mode logic tap cell for optimum DFE summer settling time. The receiver achieves less than 1E-12 PRBS31 bit error rate (BER) over a channel with 10-dB loss at 14-GHz consuming 230 mW. Fully adapted by off-chip software, the receiver performance demonstrates the effectiveness of direct h1 loop and the need for higher DFE taps to achieve a required BER over channels with reflections. Receiver performance over higher loss channels up to 23 dB and/or under emulated cross-talk noise injection cases are also presented.},

abstract={This paper presents a flexible-reach 0.5-16.3 Gb/s serial transceiver which is integrated into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and fabricated in 16-nm FinFET CMOS. The transceiver is fully adaptive to cover the FPGA requirement to support a multitude of combinations of data-rates and standards such as 10 G-KR, PCIe Gen3/4, and SFP+ across a wide range of channel loss profiles. High-performance techniques employed include a fully adaptive continuous-time linear equalizer, automatic gain control, an 11-tap decision feedback equalizer, wideband LC phase-locked loops, and a high-tracking-bandwidth clock and data recovery loop with low latency. Low-power techniques such as half-rate clocking, active inductors and data-rate programmability are employed to meet stringent power budgets at the different rates. At 16.3 Gb/s, the receiver has a jitter tolerance of >0.3UI at 100 MHz. The transceiver achieves a bit error rate <; 10e - 15 with up to 28-dB loss at Nyquist. It consumes 219 mW/channel at 16.3 Gb/s.

abstract={A 58-nm 2-Gb multi-level cell (MLC) B4-Flash memory with flexible multisector architecture has been developed, which can be realized by unique features of B4-Flash with P-channel cell; large-data programming with small cell current thanks to back bias-assisted band-to-band tunnelinginduced hot electron (B4-HE) injection mechanism, simple erase sequence without over-erase problem. In this architecture, each program and erase unit size can be extended from 256 B to 4 KB and from 256 KB to 4 MB, respectively, by utilizing 8 sectors & 2 banks simultaneous operation, and consequently 10 times faster 3.7 MB/s rewrite speed than that of conventional NOR flash can be realized by 4 KB/980 μs programming and 4 MB/80 ms erasing. A fast 110-ns random access with enough read margin has been achieved by simultaneous parallel sensing at 3 op-amps with cell-bias compensation scheme. This paper proves that B4-Flash can be a candidate for various applications which need both fast rewrite speed and fast random access as a fast rewritable NOR-type flash with MLC capability and scalability.},

abstract={This paper presents a multi-step incremental analog-to-digital converter (IADC) using multi-slope extended counting. Only one active integrator is used in the three-step conversion cycle. The accuracy of the IADC is extended by having it configured asmulti-slope ADCs in two additional steps. The proposed IADC uses the same circuitry as a first-order IADC (IADC1), but it exhibits better performance than a second-order IADC. For the same accuracy, the conversion cycle is shortened by a large factor (by more than 29 for the implemented device) compared with that of a conventional single-step IADC1. Fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS process, the prototype ADC occupies 0.5 mm2. With a 642 kHz clock, it achieves an SNDR of 52.2 dB in the first step. The SNDR is boosted to 79.8 dB in the second step and to 96.8 dB in the third step, over a 1 kHz signal band. The power consumption is 35 μW from a 1.5 V power supply. This gives an excellent Schreier figure of merit of 174.6 dB.},

abstract={An array of temperature sensors based on the thermal diffusivity (TD) of bulk silicon has been realized in a standard 40-nm CMOS process. In each TD sensor, a highly digital voltage-controlled oscillator-based ΣΔ ADC digitizes the temperature-dependent phase shift of an electrothermal filter (ETF). A phase calibration scheme is used to cancel the ADC's phase offset. Two types of ETF were realized, one optimized for accuracy and one optimized for resolution. Sensors based on the accuracy-optimized ETF achieved a resolution of 0.36 °C (rms) at 1 kSa/s, and inaccuracies of ±1.4 °C (3σ, uncalibrated) and ±0.75 °C (3σ, room-temperature calibrated) from -40 °C to 125 °C. Sensors based on the resolution-optimized ETFs achieved an improved resolution of 0.21 °C (rms), and inaccuracies of ±2.3 °C (3σ, uncalibrated) and ±1.05 °C (3σ, room-temperature calibrated). The sensors draw 2.8 mA from supply voltages as low as 0.9 V, and occupy only 1650 μm2, making them some of the smallest smart temperature sensors reported to date, and well suited for thermal monitoring applications in systems-on-chip.},

abstract={The performance of a differential LC oscillator can be enhanced by resonating the common mode of the circuit at twice the oscillation frequency. When this technique is correctly employed, Q-degradation due to the triode operation of the differential pair is eliminated and flicker noise is nulled. Until recently, one or more tail inductors have been used to achieve this common-mode resonance. In this paper, we demonstrate that additional inductors are not strictly necessary by showing that common-mode resonance can be obtained using a single tank. We present an NMOS architecture that uses a single differential inductor and a CMOS design that uses a single transformer. Prototypes are presented that achieve figure-of-merits of 192 and 195 dBc/Hz, respectively.},

abstract={This paper presents a referenceless baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR) incorporated with a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) to achieve data rates from 22.5 to 32 Gb/s across a channel with Nyquist loss ranging from 10.1 to 14.8 dB. The referenceless CDR includes a proposed frequency acquisition scheme that consists of two parts: frequency detection and frequency correction. Frequency detection is achieved by examining rising and falling data waveforms to detect discrepancies between the data rate and the locally recovered clock frequency. Frequency correction uses digitally adjustable asymmetry of the proposed adjustable baud-rate phase detector to correct any frequency error. The receiver is implemented in the TSMC 28-nm CMOS process with an analog front end consisting of a CTLE, sampling comparators, a digitally controlled oscillator, and a digital back end consisting of synthesized digital CDR logic. The open-loop frequency detector range is measured to be 39%. The closed-loop CDR capture range is measured to be 34%, limited by test equipment. The proposed frequency acquisition scheme improves the measured CDR capture range by up to 227×. At 32 Gb/s, the entire receiver consumes 102.04 mW, achieving energy consumption below 3.19 pJ/b.},

abstract={True random number generators (TRNGs) are important in data encryption for information security applications. In this paper, we propose a TRNG that utilizes a comparator in the common-mode operation and the sampling uncertainty of a D flip-flop (DFF). The comparator output is affected by the input common-mode noise and the noise that is simultaneously self-induced. A slicer generates an unpredictable and asynchronous pulse to the input of the DFF according to the output-referred noise of the comparator. By sampling the random pulse with a 3-GHz external clock, there is a sampling uncertainty, which helps to increase the random quality. As a result, we use the independent two random sources for TRNG. The area of the designed circuit is 1609 μm2. In spite of the small size, the data rate of the proposed TRNG is 3 Gb/s. We verify that the output bit stream passes all of the National Institute of Standards and Technology test suites. We fabricate the TRNG in a 65-nm CMOS process with a 1.2-V supply voltage. The power consumption of the proposed TRNG is 5 mW, and the energy per bit is 1.6 pJ/b.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52},

pages={1990-2008}, 
abstract={A frequency reconfigurable millimeter-wave (mm-wave) power amplifier (PA), which can be programmed to operate efficiently for a wide swathe of the spectrum, approaching an universal transmitter, can enable a wide range of novel applications in high-speed communication, sensing, and imaging. Classical techniques to allow large operating range either rely on broadband higher order output combining networks or tunable passives, both of which tradeoff directly with output power and efficiency. In this paper, we present an active impedance synthesis methodology that exploits the interaction of multiple unit PA cells in an asymmetrical non-isolated combiner to synthesize complex mm-wave impedances in a programmable fashion. This allows the interacting power cells to see their optimal load-pull impedances for high-efficiency frequency-reconfigurable operation in an efficient combiner network with no lossy variable passives. Compared to a symmetrical combiner, this enables the network to break the strong tradeoffs between output power, efficiency, and frequency reconfigurability, allowing it to achieve N times the Bode-Fano bound compared with an N-way symmetrical architecture. As a proof of concept, an integrated PA, which is in a 0.13-μm SiGe process, is demonstrated to achieve Psat of 23.6 dBm at a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 27.7% at 55 GHz with a frequency reconfigurable Psat,-1 dB bandwidth of 25 GHz (40-65 GHz) and a PAE,-1 dB bandwidth of 20 GHz (40-60 GHz). Multi-Gbps data rates are demonstrated with non-constant envelope modulations across the frequencies 40-60 GHz.},

abstract={In this paper, two techniques, called stage-outphasing (SO) and multiphase soft-charging (MSC), are introduced, which make use of the advanced multiphasing concept to soft-charge charge transfers between flying capacitors. As such, the charge sharing losses of fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) converters are reduced, leading to better capacitance utilization, higher efficiency, and higher power density. Furthermore, when used in combination with the Dickson converter, the relative improvement gets better with increasing voltage conversion ratio (VCR), making them an excellent choice to reduce power delivery network-induced losses in modern microchips. The impact of the proposed techniques on the performance is discussed. A 3:1 Dickson SC converter is realized, which implements SO and MSC and achieves a state-of-the-art 1.1-W/mm2 power density and 82% efficiency combination using common capacitor technologies. Finally, two figures of merit for monolithic SC dc-dc converters are proposed that include the VCR and power density, to allow fair comparison of the converter's performance to the literature.},

title={An Energy-Scalable Accelerator for Blind Image Deblurring}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={7}, 
pages={1849-1862}, 
abstract={Camera shake is a common cause of blur in cell-phone camera images. Removing blur requires deconvolving the blurred image with a kernel, which is typically unknown and needs to be estimated from the blurred image. This kernel estimation is computationally intensive and takes several minutes on a CPU, which makes it unsuitable for mobile devices. This paper presents the first hardware accelerator for kernel estimation for image deblurring applications. Our approach, using a multi-resolution iteratively reweighted least squares deconvolution engine with DFT-based matrix multiplication, a high-throughput image correlator, and a high-speed selective update-based gradient projection solver, achieves a 78x reduction in kernel estimation runtime, and a 56x reduction in total deblurring time for a $1920times 1080$ image, enabling quick feedback to the user. Configurability in kernel size and number of iterations gives up to ten times energy scalability, allowing the system to trade off runtime with image quality. The test chip, fabricated in TSMC 40-nm CMOS technology, consumes 105 mJ for kernel estimation running at 83 MHz and 0.9 V, making it suitable for integration into mobile devices.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel resonating inductor-based supply boosting scheme for low-voltage static random-access memories and logic in deep 14-nm silicon on insulator (SOI) FinFET technologies. The technique combines capacitive (C) and inductive (L) boosting for the first time. Simulation and measured hardware results from a 14-nm test chip show that this new technique is able to improve Vmin (down to 0.3 V), functional yield, and access time, when compared with designs with or without capacitive-boosted supplies. Simulations also reveal the optimal combinations of “L” and “C” needed for each Vdd to achieve minimal boost voltage, where the static random-access memory can be rendered fully functional in the absence of any assist circuitry. Furthermore, the resonant supply provides power savings compared with a boosted supply alone.},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate a 60-GHz transmit beamformer implemented in 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology which includes a Doherty amplifier driven by a dual-vector phase rotator (DVR). In addition, a benchmarking circuit comprising another DVR followed by two class-AB amplifiers, each nearly identical to the carrier amplifier within the Doherty, is included which allows us to measure the Doherty improvement in terms of efficiency and output power over conventional approaches. The dual-vector Doherty element achieves 28-dB gain with an output 1-dB compression point of +16.7 dBm. A power-added efficiency (PAE) of 16.5% is realized at 1-dB compression, with 10.8% and 7% PAE at 3- and 6-dB back-off, respectively. A stand-alone Doherty amplifier achieves a 17.1-dBm output 1-dB compression point at 23.7% PAE and a 6-dB back-off PAE of 13%. The DVR performs the phase shifting for each phased-array element necessary for beamforming, as well as providing tunable amplitude balance and phase separation between input signals to the Doherty amplifier. This allows optimization of both linearity and efficiency profiles across frequency. The Doherty element is capable of generating full 360° phase shifts with 5-b accuracy having root-mean-squared errors less than 0.6 dB in amplitude and 6° in phase from 60 to 66 GHz.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel vision chip architecture based on pixel-neighborhood-level parallel processing. In the architecture, an 8-b RISC processing core is embedded in an 8×8 array of digital pixel sensors on the same focal plane. These neighborhood processors (NPs) are tiled in a 2-D array to form the final imager resolution. Program execution is carried out in parallel across the array of pixel-neighborhood processing cores, allowing for direct scalability in terms of resolution, without reduction in processing speed or frame rate. To accomplish this, a compact, low-complexity NP architecture along with a general purpose, 8-b instruction set has been designed and implemented. A prototype vision chip containing an 8×10 array of NPs with a 64×80 resolution has been designed and fabricated in a 0.13-μm 1P8M CMOS fabrication process.

pages={2430-2447}, 
abstract={While four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) standards are emerging to increase bandwidth density, the majority of standards use simple binary non-returnto-zero (NRZ) signaling. This paper presents a dual-mode NRZ/PAM4 serial I/O SerDes which can support both modulations with minimum power and hardware overhead relative to a dedicated PAM4 link. A source-series-terminated transmitter achieves 1.2-Vpp output swing and employs lookup table control of a 31-segment output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to implement 4/2-tap feed-forward equalization in NRZ/PAM4 modes, respectively. Transmitter power is improved with low-overhead analog impedance control in the DAC cells and a quarter-rate serializer based on a tri-state inverter-based mux with dynamic pre-driver gates. The receiver implements an NRZ/PAM4 decision feedback equalizer that employs one finite impulse response and two infinite impulse response taps for first post-cursor and long-tail inter-symbol interference (ISI) cancellation, respectively. First post-cursor ISI cancellation is performed in these comparators to optimize the design's timing, while the remaining ISI taps are subtracted in a preceding current integration summer for improved sensitivity. Fabricated in GP 65-nm CMOS, the transceiver occupies 0.074 mm2 area and achieves 16 Gb/s NRZ and 32 Gb/s PAM4 operation at 10.9 and 5.5 mW/Gb/s while operating over channels with 27.6 and 13.5 dB loss at Nyquist, respectively.},

abstract={We present a fully integrated energy reservoir unit using a counter flow method for peak power delivery in space-constrained sensor systems. Recent advances in circuits have enabled significant reduction in the size of wireless systems such as implantable biomedical devices. As a consequence, the batteries integrated in these systems have also shrunk, resulting in high internal resistances (~10 kQ). However, the peak current requirement of power-hungry components such as radios remains in the milliwatt range and hence cannot directly be supplied from the battery. Therefore, an energy reservoir with high output power but small size is required. We present an efficient energy reservoir that dynamically reconfigures a storage capacitor array using a so-called counter flow approach. By creating a voltage gradient on capacitor arrays and moving the capacitors along the slope of the gradient, the supply voltage can be maintained while the energy stored in the reservoir is delivered efficiently to the load. The counter flow energy reservoir delivers 65% of stored energy before recharging is needed which allows up to a 12× reduction in overall capacitor size compared with our implementation of the previous method. The design supplies up to 13.6-mW output power for 1 μs. We demonstrate the proposed concept with a pulsed radio, showing an 11.5× increase in pulse length compared with the previous method.},

year={2017},

abstract={Piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters have drawn much interest for powering self-sustained electronic devices. Furthermore, the continuous push toward miniaturization and higher levels of integration continues to form key drivers for autonomous sensor systems being developed as parts of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The synchronized switch harvesting (SSH) on inductor and synchronous electrical charge extraction are two of the most efficient interface circuits for piezoelectric energy harvesters; however, inductors are indispensable components in these interfaces. The required inductor values can be up to 10 mH to achieve high efficiencies, which significantly increase overall system volume, counter to the requirement for miniaturized self-power systems for IoT. An inductorless bias-flip rectifier is proposed in this paper to perform residual charge inversion using capacitors instead of inductors. The voltage flip efficiency goes up to 80% while eight switched capacitors are employed. The proposed SSH on capacitors circuit is designed and fabricated in a 0.35-μm CMOS process. The performance is experimentally measured and it shows a 9.7x performance improvement compared with a full-bridge rectifier for the case of a 2.5-V open-circuit zero-peak voltage amplitude generated by the piezoelectric harvester. This performance improvement is higher than most of the reported state-of-the-art inductor-based interface circuits, while the proposed circuit has a significantly smaller overall volume enabling system miniaturization.},

year={2017},

pages={720-734}, 
abstract={A miniaturized pressure-sensing microsystem targeting intracranial pressure monitoring is presented. The system takes full advantage of Invensense MEMS-CMOS process to heterogeneously integrate the sensor and interface. This integration type requires no fabrication postprocessing and results in sub-pF sensor-interface parasitic interconnection capacitance C, which is an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported C,s. Since energy efficiency is of main concern, the minimum energy consumption for maintaining a certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analytically calculated and compared for two energy-efficient sensor front ends, namely, the switched-capacitor (SC) capacitance-to-voltage converter (CVC) and the successive approximation register (SAR) capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC). The comparison reveals for small values of C, and for low-to-moderate SNR, the SAR CDC outperforms the SC CVC in terms of power consumption. Heterogeneous integration of sensor and CMOS electronics results in only 720 fF of C, which enables direct SAR capacitance-to-digital conversion. Correlated double sampling is also integrated into the proposed SAR switching scheme to combat 1/f noise and the input-referred offset voltage of the comparator. The entire pressure-sensing system measures 2.2 × 2.6 × 0.4 mm3 in size, consumes 130 nW at 60-Hz sampling rate, and obtains 57-dB SNR with 0.2% sensor-electronics combined linearity over 520-mmHg pressure range.},

abstract={This paper presents a double pile-up resonance energy harvesting circuit that efficiently and simultaneously extracts energy from a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and a thermoelectric generator.

The harvester also operates in a boost converter mode (BCM) without an additional power switch, achieving 75% conversion efficiency at 450-μW output power. With a single-shared inductor, a simple control scheme enables the harvester to operate in both DPM and BCM by time-multiplexing method, consuming a low quiescent current of 240 nA.

The proposed fully spatially unrolled architecture reduces energy-hungry data moving for weight and activations, thus contributing to significant improvement of energy efficiency.

abstract={A design-oriented analysis (DOA) method is presented, which lends sufficient insights into various Miller compensation schemes. The method predicts the nondominant poles of the Miller-compensated amplifiers in an intuitive manner, and it serves as a good supplement to the conventional analysis. The usage of DOA is verified by the various design examples given in this paper. Guided by DOA, a multistage amplifier capable of driving a large-capacitive load ($C_{L}$ ) with low power consumption is presented. This amplifier employs an active zero to extend its Miller loop bandwidth, thereby pushing the amplifier's nondominant poles to high frequencies and achieving larger gain bandwidth (GBW). Fabricated in a 0.18-$mu text{m}$ CMOS process, the amplifier achieves 1.18-MHz GBW and 59.6° phase margin when driving an 18-nF $C_{L}$ , while consuming 69.6 $mu text{W}$ from a 1.2-V supply. The design shows improved figures-of-merit compared with the prior state-of-the-art Miller-compensated multistage amplifiers.},

abstract={An ultra-low power true random number generator (TRNG) based on a sub-ranging SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is proposed. The proposed TRNG is composed of a coarse-SAR ADC with a low-power adaptive-reset comparator and a low-power dynamic amplifier. The coarse-ADC part is shared with a sub-ranging SAR ADC for area reduction. The shared coarse-ADC not only plays the role of discrete-time chaotic circuit but also reduces the overall SAR ADC energy consumption by selectively activating the fine-SAR ADC. Also, the proposed dynamic residue amplifier consumes only 48 nW and the adaptive-reset comparator generates a chaotic map with only 6-nW consumption. The proposed TRNG core occupies 0.0045 mm2 in 0.18-μm CMOS technology and consumes 82 nW at 270-kbps throughput with 0.6-V supply.

abstract={A 2.4-GHz receiver for short-range communications with +6 dBm out-of-band IIP3 and only 2.4-mA battery current is presented. The single-ended input is coupled through an integrated transformer to a push-pull differential low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) followed by a current mode passive mixer that drives a single-opamp biquad trans-impedance amplifier. This approach ensures sufficient linearity to enable coexistence with large out-of-band interference arising from other on-chip/on-board transceivers. An efficient block stacking technique is proposed to minimize the current drawn from a standard 1.8-V supply. The first stages of the two opamps used in the I and Q baseband Rauch filters are placed above and below the LNTA core, thereby sharing its dc current. Two active inductors isolate the RF and baseband signal paths. Several techniques are used to limit the impact of the 1/f noise of the RF blocks on the receiver and to minimize nonlinearities due to interactions between blocks sharing the same current. The entire receive signal path draws 2.4 mA from a 1.8-V supply and has a noise figure of 7.8 dB at 2.4 GHz and an out-of-band 1-dB compression point of -5 dBm. The chip, implemented in 28-nm LP CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.4 mm2.},

abstract={A 64-channel 0.13-μm CMOS system on a chip (SoC) for neuroelectrical monitoring and responsive neurostimulation is presented. The ΔΣ-based neural channel records signals with rail-to-rail dc offset at the input without any area-intensive dc-removing passive components, which leads to a compact 0.013-mm2 integration area of recording and stimulation circuits. The channel consumes 630 nW, yields a signal to noise and distortion ratio of 72.2 dB, a 1.13-μVrms integrated input-referred noise over 0.1-500 Hz frequency range, and a noise efficiency factor of 2.86. Analog multipliers are implemented in each channel with minimum additional area cost by reusing the multi-bit current-digital to analog converter that is originally placed for current-mode stimulation. The multipliers are used for compact implementation of bandpass finite impulse response filters, as well as voltage gain scaling. A tri-core low-power DSP conducts phase-synchrony-based neurophysiological event detection and triggers a subset of 64 programmable arbitrary-waveform current-mode stimulators for subsequent neuromodulation. Two ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transmitters communicate to receivers located at 10 cm to 2 m distance from the implanted SoC with data rates of 10-46 Mb/s, respectively. An inductive link that operates at 1.5 MHz provides power to the SoC and is also used to communicate commands to an on-chip ASK receiver. The chip occupies 6 mm2 while consuming 1.07 and 5.44 mW with delay-based and voltage controlled oscillator-based UWB transmitters, respectively. The SoC is validated in vivo using epilepsy monitoring (seizure detection) and treatment (seizure suppression) experiments.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a low-jitter low-power digital multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) with a self-calibrated double reference injection scheme. To reduce jitter, the noisy edge of the oscillator is replaced by both the rising and falling edges of the clean reference, which results in 6-dB reduction in phase noise compared with a conventional single-edge injection MDLL. Reference spur caused by a frequency error of the oscillator, duty-cycle error of the reference, and circuit imperfection, such as offset and mismatch, is removed by employing three background feedback loops with a shared analog pulsewidth comparator. Implemented in 28-nm CMOS, the proposed digital MDLL generates 2.4-GHz clock and achieves a spur of -51.4 dBc and an rms jitter of 699 fsrms while consuming 1.5 mW from 1-V supply.},

volume={52}, 
number={2}, 
pages={569-578}, 
abstract={This paper presents a 100 MHz hybrid supply modulator (HSM) with ripple-current-based pulse width modulation (PWM) control. By sensing the ripple current, a ripple current sensor (RCS) is able to overcome the bandwidth limitation of an absolute current sensor. By leveraging the RCS, we propose a large-signal PWM control method for HSMs. This method has an intrinsically fast switching loop, and thus eliminates the need for the feed-forward path used in many previous designs. The possibility of generating high-order harmonics in PWM-controlled HSMs is pointed out for the first time, and design recommendations to avoid them are presented. A very-high-frequency triangular wave generator that is robust to both process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations and device mismatches is proposed. A proof-of-concept prototype was fabricated in CMOS 130 nm technology. Switching at 100 MHz, this HSM is able to track a 0.8 Vpp sinusoidal waveform up to 13 MHz with high fidelity. It achieves a peak efficiency of 88.2% at the maximum output power of 23 dBm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PWM-controlled HSM that is able to operate at 100 MHz.},

abstract={This paper describes a full-entropy 128-b key generation platform based on a 1024-b hybrid physically unclonable function (PUF) array, fabricated in 14-nm trigate high-k/metal-gate CMOS. Delay-hardened hybrid PUF cells use differential clock delay insertion to favor circuit evaluation in the desired direction while leveraging burn-in-induced aging for selective bit destabilization enabling quick identification and masking of unstable cells, and subsequent temporal-majority-voting with soft dark-bit masking to reduce PUF bit error by 3.9 times to 1.45% resulting in ~5 ppb failure probability. A stable full-entropy 128-b key is finally generated from the 1024 raw PUF bits using BCH error correction and AES-CBC-based entropy extraction. An all-digital design with compact PUF cell layout occupying 1.84 μm2 achieves: 1) 4-fJ/b energy-efficiency with 3-μW leakage at 0.65 V, 70°C; 2) peak operating frequency of 1 GHz resulting in 1.2-μs key generation latency; 3) robust operation with stable key generation across 0.55-0.75 V, and 25°C-110°C; 4) 14 times separation between intra/inter-PUF hamming distances with 0.99993 entropy ensuring cryptographic quality randomness and uniqueness; 5) 48% higher PUF stability with long-term aging by leveraging transistor degradation to reinforce favorable cell bias; and 6) resiliency to power cycling attacks with common centroid clock routing measured from 49.5% hamming distance between array's evaluation and wake-up states.},

Eight pipeline sub-ADCs are interleaved to achieve 10-GS/s sample rate, and mismatches between sub-ADCs are calibrated in the background. The pipeline sub-ADCs employ a variety of techniques to lower power, like avoiding a dedicated sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA-less), residue scaling, flash background calibration, dithering and inter-stage gain error background calibration. A push-pull input buffer optimized for high-frequency linearity drives the interleaved sub-ADCs to enable >7-GHz bandwidth. A fast turn-ON bootstrapped switch enables 100-ps sampling. The ADC also includes the ability to randomize the sub-ADC selection pattern to further reduce residual interleaving spurs.},

abstract={This paper presents the combination of two back-off efficiency enhancement techniques, the voltage-mode Doherty and the class-G switched-capacitor power amplifier (PA), to achieve efficiency peaking at both 6 and 12 dB back off without introducing the mode-switching glitches present in previous architectures.

abstract={A low-quiescent high-performance class-AB headphone amplifier is presented. The effect of the input-referred offset on the quiescent power of audio power amplifier (APA) that drives very small resistive load is described and analyzed. A digitally assisted offset calibration-based APA topology together with improved frequency compensation is proposed. This permits the use of low quiescent power and small compensation capacitance. Implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology, the amplifier occupies an area of 0.15 mm2 and consumes 0.4 mW at ±1 V supplies. At the load of 16 Ω//200 pF, the gain-bandwidth product is 1.78 MHz using a total compensation capacitance of 8.5 pF. Other performance metrics are measured with -89-dB total harmonic distortion (THD+N), 93.5-dB signal-to-noise ratio, 84-dB power supply rejection ratio (PSRR+), and 105-dB PSRR- @217 Hz. It can deliver a peak power of 35 mW (1.5 Vpp swing) to the above load, yielding the best figure-of-merit (FOM) = (peak load power/quiescent power) and the best FOM2 = [peak load power/quiescent power * (THD+N)%] with respect to other reported representative works.},

abstract={The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in SAR anolog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is often dominant for both power consumption and linearity. Dedicated switching schemes can save power, but mostly focus on conversion energy, whereas the DAC reset can consume significant energy as well. This paper presents an energy-free DAC reset scheme, “swap to reset,” for charge-redistribution SAR ADCs. It is widely applicable to existing low-power switching schemes. Additionally, to limit complexity while maintaining most of the energy savings, it can be utilized for the MSBs of the DAC only while the LSBs use conventional reset. To demonstrate the scheme, it is applied to the 2 MSBs of a 12-b SAR ADC using a split-monotonic DAC in 65-nm CMOS, resulting in an energy saving of 33% for the DAC or 18% for the whole ADC. Besides the “swap to reset,” a rotation is also applied to the 2 MSBs, hence enhancing the linearity to 88-dB spurious free dynamic range. The SAR ADC operates at 0.8-V power supply and 40 kS/s, achieving an signal to noise and distortion ratio of 64.2 dB and a Figure of Merit of 7.1-fJ/conversion step.},

abstract={This paper presents an injected-locked THz radiator integrating a half-quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (HQVCO), four injection-locked frequency quadruplers (ILFQs), and a chip-and-package distributed antenna (DA).

At the circuit level, intrinsic-delay compensation and harmonic boosting techniques are proposed to optimize the phase noise of the HQVCO and the output power of the ILFQs, respectively. The proposed DA composed of four exciting elements on silicon chip and a primary radiator in low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) package features a wide bandwidth of 13% and a gain of 3.8 dBi without using lens at 312 GHz. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, the radiator system occupying a core area of 0.36 mm2 achieves output frequency from 311.6 to 315.5 GHz and maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 10.5 dBm while consuming 300 mW.

Compared to on-off keying and binary frequency-shift keying modulations, more efficient bandwidth control is achieved for the same data rate with a symmetric FM template. Since the proposed modulation maintains the average center frequency of the carrier regardless of data pattern, the F-OOK signal can be generated by using only the high-pass modulation path of the conventional phase-locked loop-based two-point modulator, thus relaxing design complexity. A prototype transmitter implemented in 65-nm CMOS consumes 1.9 mW from a 0.8-V supply with a data rate of 750 kb/s, achieving an energy efficiency of 2.5 nJ/b.},

abstract={This paper presents a temperature-insensitive magnetic sensor system for contactless current measurements. To simultaneously achieve wide bandwidth and low noise, the proposed system employs a multi-path structure with a set of spinning current Hall sensors in its low-frequency path and a set of pick-up coils in its high-frequency path. The Hall sensors and pick-up coils are used in a differential sensing arrangement that naturally rejects common-mode magnetic field interference, e.g., due to the earth's magnetic field. A common-mode ac reference field can then be used to continuously stabilize the sensitivity of the Hall sensors, which, unlike that of the pick-up coils, is quite temperature dependent. In this design, the ripple reduction loops in the Hall sensor readout are implemented in a discrete-time manner, and so occupy 20% less area than a previous continuous-time implementation. Over a -45 °C to 105 °C temperature range, the proposed system reduces the Hall sensor drift from 22% to 1%, which corresponds to a temperature coefficient of 76 ppm/°C.},

title={An All-Passive Negative Feedback Network for Broadband and Wide Field-of-View Self-Steering Beam-Forming With Zero DC Power Consumption}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1260-1273}, 
abstract={This paper presents an all-passive negative feedback network that performs autonomous radio-frequency (RF) front-end beam-forming and dynamic beam-tracking toward the direction of the incident RF signal. The proposed feedback network consists of a passive RF signal processing network, voltage rectifiers, and voltage-controlled delay-line phased shifters, all of which are passive-only circuits. The negative feedback loop is realized by passive phase detection, phase-to-voltage conversion, and voltage-controlled phase shifting, achieving a large loop-gain and autonomous operation with zero DC power consumption. The nonlinear behavior of the loop is exploited to substantially expand the array field of view (FoV). A proof-of-concept broadband four-element all-passive self-steering beam-former at 5 GHz with a wide FoV is implemented in a standard 130 nm CMOS process. A high-quality four-element synthesized array factor is measured for the input progressive phase shift φin from -180° to 180°. When the proposed negative feedback loop is enabled, the normalized array factor is -2.87/-2.8 dB at φin = +90°/-90° with an input RF power Pin of -17 dBm/element at 5 GHz, achieving >25 dB array factor improvement over the open-loop operation. Moreover, the nonlinear feedback loop allows for significant array factor improvement even at φin = +180°/-180°. The proposed beam-former also achieves high-quality self-steering beamforming from 4 to 5.68 GHz with 34.7% fractional bandwidth. Therefore, the proof-of-concept all-passive self-steering beamformer outperforms the state-of-the-art active designs in terms of beam-forming quality, FoV, and fractional bandwidth. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an all-passive negative feedback - etwork for a broadband and wide FoV self-steering beam-forming with zero DC power consumption.},

pages={89-97}, 
abstract={Power management techniques can be effective at extracting more performance and energy efficiency out of mature systems on chip (SoCs). For instance, the peak performance of microprocessors is often limited by worst case technology (Vmax), infrastructure (thermal/electrical), and microprocessor usage assumptions. Performance/watt of microprocessors also typically suffers from guard bands associated with the test and binning processes as well as worst case aging/lifetime degradation. Similarly, on multicore processors, shared voltage rails tend to limit the peak performance achievable in low thread count workloads. In this paper, we describe five power management techniques that maximize the per-part performance under the before-mentioned constraints. Using these techniques, we demonstrate a net performance increase of up to 15% depending on the application and TDP of the SoC, implemented on “Bristol Ridge,” a 28-nm CMOS, dual-core ×86 accelerated processing unit.},

abstract={Design and successful implementation of a fully integrated CMOS fluorescence biochip for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) testing in molecular diagnostics (MDx) is presented. The biochip includes a 32 × 32 array of continuous wave fluorescence detection biosensing elements. Each biosensing element is capable of having unique DNA probe sequences, wavelength-selective multi-dielectric emission filter (OD of 3.6), resistive heater for thermal cycling, and a high performance and programmable photodetector. The dimension of each biosensor is 100 μm × 100 μm with a 50 μm × 50 μm Nwell-Psub photodiode acting as the optical transducer, and a ΣA modulator-based photocurrent sensor. The measured photodetector performance shows ~116 dB detection dynamic range (10 fA-10 nA) over the 25 °C-100 °C temperature range, while being~1 dB away from the fundamental shot-noise limit. To empirically demonstrate the compatibility of this biochip with MDx applications, we have successfully utilized the array and its thermal cycling capability to adopt a 7-plex panel for detection of six human upper respiratory viruses.},

abstract={A 56-Gb/s PAM4 wireline transceiver testchip is implemented in 16-nm FinFET.

abstract={A 168-fs rms jitter, 48-MHz differential crystal oscillator based on a new active inductor biasing circuit achieves differential operation with low noise, power, and area overhead. This architecture has two significant advantages compared to the single-ended crystal oscillators that are normally used: 1) this circuit rejects power supply noise and interference which leads to lower jitter and 2) the crystal oscillator-induced spurious tones are smaller and therefore less detrimental to sensitive blocks (e.g., LNA) in RF radios. This paper theoretically analyzes the differential crystal oscillator and provides detailed design considerations. A prototype requires half the power and 80% less area than previously reported differential crystal oscillators. Implemented in a 28-nm LP CMOS process, it draws 1.5 mA from a 1-V supply and occupies 0.013 mm2.},

abstract={This paper presents a continuous-time delta-sigma modulator using a double noise-shaped quantizer (DNSQ), which not only provides 2nd-order noise shaping but also generates a 6-bit quantization in the modulator. The proposed DNSQ efficiently extracts the quantization error in the time domain from a noise-shaped integrating quantizer (NSIQ), and directly applies it to a gated ring oscillator-based quantizer, hence achieving a 2nd order of noise shaping on its own. By incorporating the DNSQ, the modulator can achieve 4th-order noise shaping with only a 2nd-order loop filter. The proposed modulator is fabricated in a 0.13-μm CMOS process with an active area of 0.17 mm2. It operates at 640 MHz and achieves a peak SNDR of 80.4 dB in a 15-MHz bandwidth while consuming 11.4 mW from a 1.2-V power supply.},

title={Wideband Mixed-Domain Multi-Tap Finite-Impulse Response Filtering of Out-of-Band Noise Floor in Watt-Class Digital Transmitters}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3405-3420}, 
abstract={A major drawback of digital transmitters (DTX) is the absence of a reconstruction filter after digital-to-analog conversion which causes the baseband quantization noise to get upconverted to radio frequency and amplified at the output of the transmitter. In high power transmitters, this upconverted noise can be so strong as to prevent their use in frequency-division duplexing systems due to receiver desensitization or impose stringent coexistence challenges. In this paper, we describe a DTX that embeds mixed-domain multi-tap finite-impulse response (FIR) filtering with programmable analog sub-sample delays within a highly linear and mismatch-resilient switched-capacitor DTX architecture. It is shown that switched-capacitor power amplifiers (SCPA) in conjunction with transformer-based power combining are ideal candidates for embedding mixed-domain FIR filtering since the near-constant source impedance of the SCPA greatly aids in linear FIR summation thereby preserving the desired noise-shaping profile. Moreover, their excellent mismatch characteristics help in ensuring precise tap weights in the FIR which enhances noise suppression. The availability of multiple taps in this architecture also allows the synthesis of FIR configurations with wide notch bandwidths (BW). Theoretical analyses of this architecture and design trade-offs related to linearity, mismatch, output power, and efficiency are discussed. The implemented 65 nm CMOS prototype exhibits a peak output power of 30.3 dBm and a peak system efficiency of 34%, and achieves a noise floor of -149 dBc/Hz over a BW of 20 MHz at an offset of 135 MHz from a 2.23 GHz carrier while transmitting a 1.4 MHz 64-QAM signal with an average output power of 22 dBm.},

title={Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={1}, 
pages={127-138}, 
abstract={Eyeriss is an accelerator for state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It optimizes for the energy efficiency of the entire system, including the accelerator chip and off-chip DRAM, for various CNN shapes by reconfiguring the architecture. CNNs are widely used in modern AI systems but also bring challenges on throughput and energy efficiency to the underlying hardware. This is because its computation requires a large amount of data, creating significant data movement from on-chip and off-chip that is more energy-consuming than computation. Minimizing data movement energy cost for any CNN shape, therefore, is the key to high throughput and energy efficiency. Eyeriss achieves these goals by using a proposed processing dataflow, called row stationary (RS), on a spatial architecture with 168 processing elements. RS dataflow reconfigures the computation mapping of a given shape, which optimizes energy efficiency by maximally reusing data locally to reduce expensive data movement, such as DRAM accesses. Compression and data gating are also applied to further improve energy efficiency. Eyeriss processes the convolutional layers at 35 frames/s and 0.0029 DRAM access/multiply and accumulation (MAC) for AlexNet at 278 mW (batch size N = 4), and 0.7 frames/s and 0.0035 DRAM access/MAC for VGG-16 at 236 mW (N = 3).},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={4}, 
pages={1077-1090}, 
abstract={This paper presents a new energy-efficient ring oscillator collapse-based comparator, named edge-pursuit comparator (EPC). This comparator automatically adjusts the performance by changing the comparison energy according to its input difference without any control, eliminating unnecessary energy spent on coarse comparisons. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the EPC in the phase domain shows improved energy efficiency over conventional comparators even without energy scaling, and wider resolution tuning capability with small load capacitance and area. The EPC is used in a successive-approximation-register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) design, which supplements a 10 b differential coarse capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) with a 5 b common-mode CDAC. This offers an additional 5 b of resolution with common mode to differential gain tuning that improves linearity by reducing the effect of switch parasitic capacitance. A test chip fabricated in 40 nm CMOS shows 74.12 dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and 173.4 dB Schreier Figure-of-Merit. With the full ADC consuming 1.17 μW, the comparator consumes 104 nW, which is only 8.9% of the full ADC power, proving the comparator's energy efficiency.},

abstract={A non-interleaved 2-GS/s, 8-bit flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) utilizing the remainder number system (RNS) quantization principle is presented. The RNS quantization reduces the number of comparators and thus improves the figure of merit of the flash ADC. A time-domain implementation is adopted to reduce the ADC input capacitance with a voltage-to-time converter (VTC) front end. The ring oscillator-based time-to-digital converter (TDC) also provides a linear and efficient modulo (folding) operation for the RNS quantization with built-in dynamic element matching. Offline TDC mismatch calibration based on a histogram (code density) test is also employed to further improve the ADC linearity.

abstract={This paper presents a 401-428-MHz BFSK/QPSK transmitter (TX) with two types of fractional-injection-locking techniques for multichannel transmission capabilities. A ΔΣbased injection-locked ring oscillator is proposed to achieve fine frequency tuning with a frequency resolution of 1.3 kHz. The proposed method facilitates multichannel BFSK modulation. For high data rate wideband QPSK modulation, frequency tuning is achieved through sequential injection locking. The TX performs 550 Kb/s for BFSK and 11 Mb/s for band-shaped QPSK with EVM of 4.4% and 4.9%, respectively. It also achieves a settling time of less than 0.8 μs. This helps to save operating power of the wireless medical devices with duty-cycling protocol employed in the TX. Fabricated in 130-nm process technology, the TX achieves an energy efficiency of 370 pJ/b while delivering -13 dBm of output power with 1-V supply.},

abstract={We present an ultra-low-power Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) transceiver (TRX) for the Internet of Things (IoT) optimized for digital 28-nm CMOS. A transmitter (TX) employs an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with a switched current-source digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) featuring low frequency pushing, and class-E/F2 digital power amplifier (PA), featuring high efficiency. Low 1/f DCO noise allows the ADPLL to shut down after acquiring lock. The receiver operates in discrete time at high sampling rate (~10 Gsamples/s) with intermediate frequency placed beyond 1/f noise corner of MOS devices. New multistage multirate charge-sharing bandpass filters are adapted to achieve high out-of-band linearity, low noise, and low power consumption. An integrated on-chip matching network serves to both PA and low-noise transconductance amplifier, thus allowing a 1-pin direct antenna connection with no external band-selection filters. The TRX consumes 2.75 mW on the RX side and 3.7 mW on the TX side when delivering 0 dBm in BLE.},

abstract={This paper presents a programmable, energy-efficient, and real-time object detection hardware accelerator for low power and high throughput applications using deformable parts models, with 2x higher detection accuracy than traditional rigid body models. Three methods are used to address the high computational complexity of eight deformable parts detection: classification pruning for 33x fewer part classification, vector quantization for 15x memory size reduction, and feature basis projection for 2x reduction in the cost of each classification. The chip was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology, and can process full high definition 1920 × 1080 videos at 60 frames/s without any OFF-chip storage. The chip has two programmable classification engines (CEs) for multiobject detection. At 30 frames/s, the chip consumes only 58.6 mW (0.94 nJ/pixel, 1168 GOPS/W).

abstract={This paper presents a machine-learning classifier where computations are performed in a standard 6T SRAM array, which stores the machine-learning model. Peripheral circuits implement mixed-signal weak classifiers via columns of the SRAM, and a training algorithm enables a strong classifier through boosting and also overcomes circuit nonidealities, by combining multiple columns. A prototype 128 × 128 SRAM array, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process, demonstrates ten-way classification of MNIST images (using image-pixel features downsampled from 28 × 28 = 784 to 9 × 9 = 81, which yields a baseline accuracy of 90%). In SRAM mode (bit-cell read/write), the prototype operates up to 300 MHz, and in classify mode, it operates at 50 MHz, generating a classification every cycle. With accuracy equivalent to a discrete SRAM/digital-MAC system, the system achieves ten-way classification at an energy of 630 pJ per decision, 113× lower than a discrete system with standard training algorithm and 13× lower than a discrete system with the proposed training algorithm.},

abstract={Digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) frequency synthesizers have become popular for wireless applications in the sub-10-GHz range. However, mm-wave synthesizers still rely on analog PLLs, predominantly of the sub-harmonic, integerN-type. This paper describes the design and implementation of a 50-66-GHz phase-domain DPLL that uses a fundamental frequency capacitively degenerated digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) with 40-kHz frequency step. Following frequency division with a modulus of only 4, a two-step 8-bit time-todigital converter (TDC) digitizes the phase of the 12.5-16.5-GHz divider output with 450-fs resolution. Digital calibration based on the statistical element selection technique augmented by mean adaptation is used to mitigate TDC nonlinearity that results from random mismatches. Additional digital calibration techniques are introduced to mitigate DCO non-linearity and phase mismatches in the digital phase extraction sub-system, and to ensure robust operation of the inductor-less 4× frequency divider over process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. A 65-nm CMOS prototype of the DPLL occupies 0.45 mm2 excluding pads and consumes 46 mA from a 1-V supply. The PLL achieves best (worst) case rms jitter of 220 (302) fs, best (worst) phase noise of -83/-94.5/-122 (-79/-88/ -116) dBc/Hz at 0.1/1/10 MHz offset, and -52.2(-48.3) dBc fractional spur.},

abstract={Integrated optical system-on-chip in silicon operating in the visible range can have a tremendous impact on enabling new applications in sensing and imaging through the ultra-miniaturization of complex optical instrumentation. CMOS technology has allowed an integration of optical detection circuitry for image sensors with massively large number of pixels. In this paper, we focus on techniques to realize complex optical-field processing elements inside CMOS by exploiting optical interaction with sub-wavelength metal nanostructures realized in the electrical interconnects layers, whose feature sizes are now in the sub-100-nm range. In particular, we present a fully integrated fluorescence-based bio-molecular sensor in 65-nm CMOS with integrated nanoplasmonic waveguide-based filters capable of more than 50 dB of rejection ratio across a wide range of incident angles. Co-designed with the integrated photo-detection circuitry, capacitive TIAs, and correlated double-sampling circuitry, the sensor is capable of detecting 48 zeptomoles of quantum dots on the surface with 52 fA of photodetector current with a fluorescence/excitation ratio of nearly -62 dB without any post-fabrication, external optical filters, lenses, or collimators. The ability to integrate complex nanoplasmonic metal structures with unique optical properties in CMOS with no post-processing creates the opportunity to enable large multiplexed assays on a single chip and a wide variety of applications, from in vitro to in vivo.},

abstract={Hybrid neural networks (hybrid-NNs) have been widely used and brought new challenges to NN processors. Thinker is an energy efficient reconfigurable hybrid-NN processor fabricated in 65-nm technology. To achieve high energy efficiency, three optimization techniques are proposed. First, each processing element (PE) supports bit-width adaptive computing to meet various bit-widths of neural layers, which raises computing throughput by 91% and improves energy efficiency by 1.93x on average. Second, PE array supports on-demand array partitioning and reconfiguration for processing different NNs in parallel, which results in 13.7% improvement of PE utilization and improves energy efficiency by 1.11x. Third, a fused data pattern-based multi-bank memory system is designed to exploit data reuse and guarantee parallel data access, which improves computing throughput and energy efficiency by 1.11x and 1.17x, respectively. Measurement results show that this processor achieves 5.09-TOPS/W energy efficiency at most.},

A following temperature-insensitive time-based residue amplifier realizes open-loop residual amplification without background calibration, while maintaining the benefits of dynamic operation and noise filtering. Furthermore, asynchronous SAR control logic employs a pre-window technique to accelerate SAR logic operations. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 130-nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.22 mm2. With a 1.2-V power supply and a Nyquist frequency input, the ADC consumes 1.32 mW at 50 MS/s and achieves signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and spurious-free dynamic range of 69.1 and 80.7 dB, respectively. The operating speed is scalable from 10 to 50 MS/s with a scalable power supply range of 0.8-1.2 V. Walden FoMs of 4-11.3 fJ/conversion-step are achieved.},

It also achieves the state-of-the-art area efficiency, occupying only 0.16 mm2 in the 0.16-μm CMOS.

abstract={A power-efficient body-coupled communication pseudo orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (P-OFDM) transceiver (TRX) is presented for binaural hearing aids (BHAs). Channel measurements are performed for different body postures between human head-to-hand and ear-to-ear to characterize the body channel path loss. The TRX exploits baseband 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM symbols transmitted through a binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation to mitigate the multipath and interference problems, which are the most serious issues in BHA, with bit error rate improvement of 74% compared to FSK. It is also free from the peak-to-average power ratio problem. A power-of-two decomposition constant multiplier is implemented to achieve area-efficient constant multiplications in 64-FFT. The proposed energyand area-efficient miniaturized direct conversion FSK demodulation receiver is capable of demodulating up to 20 Mbps signals while reducing the area by >50% compared to conventional implementations.

volume={52},

pages={1123-1133}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a cascaded fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL) based on a high-frequency piezoelectric resonator (PZR). Sub-ppb-order frequency resolution is achieved by a channel adjustment technique. Besides its small form factor, a high-Q PZR at gigahertz frequencies realizes a very low phase-noise synthesizer for RF applications. However, three fundamental issues remain to be solved: the narrow tuning range and large process variation of PZR-based oscillators, the low-frequency resolution of a PLL referenced to gigahertz-order frequencies, and the undesirable harmonic oscillation caused by the inductance of the CMOS-PZR bonding wire. To overcome these issues, we propose a channel-adjusting technique (CAT) that adaptively sets the division ratio of two PLLs to maintain constant output frequency of the second PLL while varying the PZR oscillator frequency, hence permitting the narrow tuning range and wide process variation of the PZR oscillator. The first PLL in our PLL architecture determines the output frequency resolution and the second reduces the power consumption of the delta-sigma modulator. We also suppress the harmonic oscillations in the PZR oscillator. The prototype PLL is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS and achieves an 8.484-8.912-GHz output, 180-fs rms jitter, and -244-dB FOM while consuming 12.7-mW power. We developed a cascaded fractional-N PLL based on a high-frequency PZR with a sub-ppb-order CAT, which overcomes the narrow tuning range problem in gigahertz PZRs. A prototype PLL fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS consumed 12.7 mW and output 8.484-8.912 GHz with 180-fs rms jitter.},

pages={3018-3031}, 
abstract={This paper presents a high-precision capacitanceto-digital converter (CDC) for displacement measurement in advanced industrial applications, based on a charge-balancing third-order delta-sigma modulator. To achieve high precision, this CDC employs a precision external resistive reference and a quartz-oscillator-based time reference instead of a reference capacitor. To minimize the error contribution of the CDC circuitry, various precision circuit techniques, such as chopping and auto-zeroing, are applied at both system and circuit level. Measurement results of the prototype realized in 0.35-μm CMOS technology show that the CDC achieves an rms resolution of 42 aF across a capacitance range from 6 to 22 pF, corresponding to an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 16.7 bit. The conversion time for one measurement is 10.5 ms, during which the CDC consumes 230 μA from a 3.3-V single supply. The measured thermal stability is within ±7.5 ppm/°C across a temperature range from 20 °C to 70 °C, which represents a significant improvement compared to the state of the art.

abstract={This paper introduces a CMOS vision sensor chip in a standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology for Gaussian pyramid extraction. The Gaussian pyramid provides computer vision algorithms with scale invariance, which permits having the same response regardless of the distance of the scene to the camera. The chip comprises 176×120 photosensors arranged into 88×60 processing elements (PEs). The Gaussian pyramid is generated with a double-Euler switched capacitor (SC) network. Every PE comprises four photodiodes, one 8 b single-slope analog-to-digital converter, one correlated double sampling circuit, and four state capacitors with their corresponding switches to implement the double-Euler SC network. Every PE occupies 44 × 44 μm2. Measurements from the chip are presented to assess the accuracy of the generated Gaussian pyramid for visual tracking applications. Error levels are below 2% full-scale output, thus making the chip feasible for these applications. Also, energy cost is 26.5 nJ/px at 2.64 Mpx/s, thus outperforming conventional solutions of imager plus microprocessor unit.},

abstract={Closed-loop neuromodulation is an essential function in future neural implants for delivering efficient and effective therapy. However, a closed-loop system requires the neural-recording front-end to handle large stimulation artifacts-a feature not supported by most state-of-the-art designs. In this paper, we present a neural-recording front-end that has an input range of ±50 mV and can be used in closed-loop systems. The proposed front-end avoids the saturation due to stimulation artifacts by employing a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to directly convert the input signal into the frequency domain. The VCO nonlinearity is corrected using area-efficient foreground polynomial correction. Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, the design occupies 0.135 mm2 with an analog power of 3 μW and a digital switching power of 4 μW. It achieves ten times higher linear input range than prior art, and 79-dB spurious-free dynamic range at peak input, with an input-referred noise of 5.2 μVrms across the local-field-potential band of 1-200 Hz. With on-chip subhertz high-pass filters realized by duty-cycled resistors, the front-end also eliminates the need of off-chip dc-blocking capacitors.},

abstract={This paper proposes a coarse-fine dual-loop architecture for the digital low drop-out (LDO) regulators with fast transient response and more than 200-mA load capacity. In the proposed scheme, the output voltage is coregulated by two loops, namely, the coarse loop and the fine loop. The coarse loop adopts a fast current-mirror flash analog to digital converter and supplies high output current to enhance the transient performance, while the fine loop delivers low output current and helps reduce the voltage ripples and improve the regulation accuracies. Besides, a digital controller is implemented to prevent contentions between the two loops. Fabricated in a 28-nm Samsung CMOS process, the proposed digital LDO achieves maximum load up to 200 mA when the input and the output voltages are 1.1 and 0.9 V, respectively, with a chip area of 0.021 mm2. The measured output voltage drop of around 120 mV is observed for a load step of 180 mA.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={9}, 
pages={2475-2487}, 
abstract={This paper presents a methodology and chip demonstration to design near-/sub-threshold voltage (Vt) pipelines using pulsed latches that are clocked at very wide pulses. Pulsed-latch-based design is known for time borrowing capability but the amount of time borrowing is limited due to hold time constraint. To enable more cycle borrowing, in this paper, we aim to pad short paths to ~1/3 cycle time using multi-Vt cell library. While delay padding using multi-Vt cells is common in super-Vt design, the small delay difference among multi-Vt cells has not allowed such extensive short path padding due to large area overhead. However, in near-/sub-Vt regime, circuits delay becomes exponentially sensitive to Vt, suggesting that high-Vt cells can significantly reduce the overhead of padding. We build a semi-automatic short path padding flow around this idea, and use it to design: 1) ISCAS benchmark circuits and 2) an 8-bit 8-tap finite impulse response (FIR) core, the latter fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The chip measurement shows that the proposed FIR core achieves 45.2% throughput (frequency), 11% energy efficiency (Energy/cycle), and 38% energy-delay-product improvements at 0.35 V over the flip-flop-pipelined baseline. The measurement results also confirm that the proposed FIR core operates with the same pulsewidth setting robustly across process, voltage, and temperature variations.},

abstract={A wearable electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system is proposed for the portable real-time 3-D lung ventilation monitoring. It consists of two types of SoCs, active electrode (AE)-SoC and Hub-SoC, mounted on wearable belts. The 48-channel AE-SoCs are integrated on flexible printed circuit board belt, and Hub-SoC is integrated in the hub module which performs data gathering and wireless communication between an external imaging device. To get high accuracy under the variation of conductivity, the dual-mode current stimulator provides the optimal frequency for time difference-EIT and frequency difference-EIT with simultaneous 4 k-128 kHz impedance sensing. A wide dynamic range instruments amplifier is proposed to provide 94 dB of wide dynamic range impedance sensing. In addition, the 48-channel AE system with the dedicated communication and calibration is implemented to achieve 1.4-mΩ sensitivity of impedance difference in the in vivo environment. The AE-/Hub-SoCs occupy 3.2 and 1.3 mm2in 65-nm CMOS technology and consume 124 μW and 1.1 mW with 1.2 V supply, respectively. As a result, EIT images are reconstructed with 90% of accuracy, and up to 10 frames/s real-time 3-D lung images are successfully displayed.},

It suppresses both comparator noise and quantization error by accurately estimating the ADC conversion residue. It allows a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be achieved with a noisy low-power comparator and a relatively low resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The proposed technique has low hardware complexity, requiring no change to the standard ADC operation except for repeating the least significant bit (LSB) comparisons. Three estimation schemes are studied and the optimal Bayes estimator is chosen for a prototype 11-b ADC in 65-nm CMOS.

Overall, it achieves 10.5-b effective number of bits while operating at 100 kS/s and consuming 0.6 μW from a 0.7-V power supply.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and implementation of a millimeter-wave fundamental frequency circularly polarized radiator, which employs a multi-port cavity as the core of a high-Q resonator, a power combiner, and an antenna. A general theory of multi-port oscillators-and in particular, the widely used circularly symmetric oscillator topologies-is presented, which quantitatively investigates and predicts all possible oscillation states, their associated modes of operation, and the oscillation stability. The outcomes of this theory are utilized to design a power-optimized eight-port rotationally symmetric radiator, excited at the oscillation state with a 45 phase difference between the adjacent ports, which, in turn, enables a high-efficiency circularly polarized radiation. Fabricated in 0.13-μm BiCMOS process, this cavity-backed circularly polarized radiator operates at the frequency of 114 GHz and achieves 14.2-dBm equivalent-isotropic-radiated power (EIRP), 5.2% dc-to-EIRP conversion efficiency, 8.2 dBm radiated power, 1.3% dc-to-radiation efficiency, and -99.3 dBc/Hz phase noise at 1-MHz offset, without using silicon lens.},

abstract={With an ever-increasing demand for energy efficiency, processors with instant-on and zero leakage features are highly appreciated in energy harvesting as well as “normally off” applications. Recently, zero-standby power and fast switching nonvolatile processors (NVPs) have been proposed based on emerging nonvolatile memories (NVMs), such as ferroelectric RAM or spin-transfer-torque magnetic RAM. However, previous NVPs store all data to NVM upon every power interruption, resulting in high-energy consumption and degraded NVM endurance. This paper presents a 65-nm fully CMOS-logic-compatible ReRAM-based NVP supporting time-space domain adaption. It incorporates adaptive nonvolatile controller, nonvolatile flip-flops, and nonvolatile static random access memory (nvSRAM) with self-write termination. Data redundancy in both time and space domain is fully exploited to reduce store/restore time/energy and boost clock frequency. The NVP operates at >100 MHz and achieves 20 ns/0.45 nJ restore time/energy, realizing >6× and >6000× higher speed and energy efficiency of restore and >4× faster operating frequency compared with that of state of the art.},

abstract={Biological cells are characterized by highly complex phenomena and processes that are, to a great extent, interdependent. To gain detailed insights, devices designed to study cellular phenomena need to enable tracking and manipulation of multiple cell parameters in parallel; they have to provide high signal quality and high-spatiotemporal resolution. To this end, we have developed a CMOS-based microelectrode array system for in vitro applications that integrates six measurement and stimulation functions, the largest number to date. Moreover, the system features the largest active electrode array area to date (4.48 × 2.43 mm2) to accommodate 59760 electrodes, while its power consumption, noise characteristics, and spatial resolution (13.5-μm electrode pitch) are comparable to the best state-of-the-art devices. The system includes: 2048 action potential (AP, bandwidth: 300 Hz-10 kHz) recording units, 32 local-field-potential (LFP, bandwidth: 1 Hz-300 Hz) recording units, 32 current recording units, 32 impedance measurement units, and 28 neurotransmitter detection units, in addition to the 16 dual-mode voltage-only or current/voltage-controlled stimulation units.

abstract={This paper introduces the first high-volume manufacturable (HVM) metal-fuse technology in a 14-nm trigate high-k metal-gate CMOS process. A high-density array featuring a 0.9-μm2 bit cell with an efficient bit level redundancy scheme is presented. An array efficiency of over 53% is achieved through hierarchical bitline design by minimizing the impact of parasitic resistance on fuse programming through short local bitline and sharing sense amplifier through longer global bitline. A power gating-based scheme is adopted to reduce leakage current consumption and high-voltage exposure to minimize reliability concern. Program conditions can be optimized for HVM and in-field programming to achieve close to 100% unit level yield with the proposed redundancy scheme.},

year={2017},

pages={496-504}, 
abstract={Resistive nonvolatile memory (NVM) is considered to be a leading candidate for next-generation memory. However, maintaining a target sensing margin is a challenge with technology scaling because of the increased process variation and decreased read cell current. This paper proposes an offset-canceling current-sampling sense amplifier (OCCS-SA) that is intended for use in deep submicrometer resistive NVM. The proposed OCCS-SA has the three major advantages of: 1) offset voltage cancellation; 2) double sensing margin structure; and 3) strong positive feedback. The measurement results from a 65 nm test chip show that the proposed OCCS-SA achieves 2.4 times faster sensing time (tSEN) at a nominal supply voltage (VDD) of 1.0 V and a greater than 20% reduction in VDD at the same tSEN, compared to the state-of-the-art current-sampling-based SA, which features offset voltage cancellation and weak positive feedback.},

abstract={We report a micro-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system compatible with multi-type biological/chemical lab-on-a-chip assays. Unified in a handheld scale (dimension: 14 × 6 × 11 cm3, weight: 1.4 kg), the system is capable to detect <;100 pM of Enterococcusfaecalis derived DNA from a 2.5 μL sample. The key components are a portable magnet (0.46 T, 1.25 kg) for nucleus magnetization, a system PCB for I/O interface, an FPGA for system control, a current driver for trimming the magnetic (B) field, and a silicon chip fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS. The latter, integrated with a current-mode vertical Hall sensor and a low-noise readout circuit, facilitates closed-loop B-field stabilization (2 mT → 0.15 mT), which otherwise fluctuates with temperature or sample displacement. Together with a dynamic-B-field transceiver with a planar coil for micro-NMR assay and thermal control, the system demonstrates: 1) selective biological target pinpointing; 2) protein state analysis; and 3) solvent-polymer dynamics, suitable for healthcare, food and colloidal applications, respectively. Compared to a commercial NMR-assay product (Bruker mq-20), this platform greatly reduces the sample consumption (120×), hardware volume (175×), and weight (96×).},

pages={735-746}, 
abstract={Spatial interference rejection in analog adaptive beamforming receivers can improve the distortion performance of the circuits following the beamforming network, but is susceptible to the nonlinearity of the beamforming network itself. This paper presents an analysis of intermodulation product cancellation in analog active phased array receivers and verifies the distortion improvement in a four-element adaptive beamforming receiver for low-power applications in the 1.0-2.5-GHz frequency band. In this architecture, a constant-Gm vector modulator is proposed that produces an accurate equidistance square constellation, leading to a sliced frontend design that is duplicated for each antenna element. By moving the transconductances to RF, a fourfold reduction in power is achieved, while simultaneously providing input impedance matching. The 65-nm implementation consumes between 6.5 and 9 mW per antenna element and shows a +1 to +20 dBm in-band and out-of-beam third-order intercept point due to intermodulation distortion reduction.},

abstract={This paper describes a capacitive-gain amplifier (CGA) with common-mode (CM) sampling (CMS) and switched-capacitor driving capability. The CMS CGA defines the amplifier CM voltage in a single auto-zero phase that significantly reduces the CM settling time. A pre-charge technique and dynamic filtering are used to allow the CGA to drive a switchedcap analog-to-digital converter (ADC) directly that relaxes the speed requirement on CGA and reduces folded noise aliases due to ADC sampling. As a result, it achieves 19-nV/√Hz noise density while dissipating 75 μA. The 5 ppm/full-scale-range integral nonlinearity is achieved with programmable gain range from 1 to 128 with 2.7 to 3.6 V supply. It has 2 μV typical offset and 0.81 ppm/°C max gain error drift.

abstract={This paper presents a small form factor dc-dc converter that can be used in a ladder architecture to provide state-of-charge equalization for large-scale lithium-ion arrays. A resonant switched-capacitor converter is implemented in a 180-nm bulk CMOS process that uses a merged-interleaving architecture to affect two-phase interleaving with only a single inductor. The approach has the advantage of reducing passive component volume for a given efficiency and voltage ripple constraint. A bidirectional current-mode control scheme is outlined that uses regulated zero-current switching and partial zero-voltage switching. The design also supports electrochemical diagnostic functions through a fully digital spectroscopic perturbation of cell current. Cell voltage and current are digitized through 10-b SAR analog to digital converters (ADCs), filtered and decimated for off-chip impedance extraction. The converter achieves 94.8% conversion efficiency in 1:1 balancing mode with a total board area less than 1 cm2, and supports bidirectional power transfer >3.7 W.},

abstract={This paper presents the first reported 28-GHz phased-array IC for 5G communications. Implemented in 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS, the IC includes 32 TRX elements and features concurrent independent beams in two polarizations in either TX or RX operation. Circuit techniques to enable precise beam steering, orthogonal phase and amplitude control at each front end, and independent tapering and beam steering at the array level are presented. A TX/RX switch design is introduced which minimizes TX path loss resulting in 13.5 dBm/16 dBm Op1dB/Psat per front end with >20% peak power added efficiency of the power amplifier (including switch and off-mode LNA) while maintaining a 6 dB noise figure in the low noise amplifier (including switch and off-mode PA). Comprehensive on-wafer measurement results for the IC across multiple samples and temperature variation are presented. A package with four ICs and 64 dual-polarized antennas provides eight 16-element or two 64-element concurrent beams with 1.4°/step beam steering (<;0.6° rms error) across a ±50° steering range without requiring calibration. A maximum saturated effective isotropic radiated power of 54 dBm is measured in the broadside direction for each polarization. Tapering control without requiring calibration achieves up to 20-dB sidelobe rejection without affecting the main lobe direction.},

abstract={Closed-loop neuromodulation is essential for the advance of neuroscience and for administering therapy in patients suffering from drug-resistant neurological conditions. Neural stimulation generates large artifacts at the recording sites, which easily saturate traditional recording front ends. This paper presents a neural recording chopper amplifier capable of handling in-band artifacts up to 40 mVpp while preserving the accompanying small neural signals. New techniques have been proposed that solve the issues of low input impedance and electrode-offset rejection, which enable a DC input impedance of 300 MΩ and a dynamic range of 69 dB (200 Hz-5 kHz) and 78 dB (1-200 Hz). Implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, the prototype occupies an area of 0.071 mm2/channel, and consumes 2 μW from a 1.2 V supply. The input-referred noise is 7 μVrms (200 Hz-20 kHz) and 2 μVrms (1-200 Hz). The total harmonic distortion for a 20-mVp input at 1 kHz is -74 dB. This paper improves the linearity by 14-26 dB, dynamic range by 11-28 dB, and input-impedance for chopped front ends by a factor of 11 as compared with the current state of the art, while achieving similar power and noise performance.},

abstract={An efficient buck/buck-boost reconfigurable LED driver based on peak current control is introduced. The driver supports pulse-width modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) operations. The use of a combination of rectified sin and sin2 functions in the reference is introduced for the purpose of improving the power factor (PF) and total harmonic distortion (THD) of buck and buck-boost converters. The optimal reference waveform shape for buck and buck/boost modes can be set externally. The design ensures that the peak of the inductor current maintains a constant level that is invariant for different ac line voltages. The LED driver has been implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process. PF and THD are improved when the proposed reference is employed, and the peak PF and lowest THD values are 0.995/0.983/0.996 and 7.8/6.2/3.5% for the buck (PWM), buck (PFM), and buck-boost (PFM) cases, respectively. The corresponding peak efficiency for the three cases is 88/92/91%, respectively.},

abstract={A 5× 80 W class-D audio power amplifier for automotive applications is presented. The amplifier is implemented in a 140-nm bipolar CMOS DMOS SOI. Configurable digital-loop filters can compensate for a range of LC output filters and their high loop gain (>50 dB between 20 Hz and 20 kHz) suppresses non-idealities of the output filter and enables low-cost output filter components. Key elements are the integrated low-latency ΔΣ analog to digital converters (ADCs) which digitize the output signals directly at the speaker load, after the output filter. The ADCs use filtering finite impulse response digital to analog converters in their feedback path to create an input-output transfer with a negative group delay at low frequencies. The ADCs have 116-dBA DR and -108 dB total harmonic distortion (THD). The bridge-tied load amplifier supports multiphase pulse-width modulation for lower electromagnetic interference. It operates with supplies from 6 to 25 V and with loads down to 1 Ω and achieves 19-μV idle noise (Awtd) and 0.004% THD + N.},

abstract={In this paper, a general embedding is proposed to boost the power gain of any device to the maximum achievable gain (Gmax), which is defined as the maximum theoretical gain of the device. Using a gain-plane based analysis, two linear-lossless-reciprocal embeddings are used to perform a movement from the coordinate of the transistor to the coordinate that corresponds to Gmax. The proposed embedding is applied to a 10 μm common-source NMOS transistor, and the theoretical and simulation results are presented and compared. The properties of the embedded transistor are inspected, and the few issues in implementation are investigated and addressed. Finally, using the proposed general embedding, an amplifier is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process with a measured power gain of 9.2 dB at 260 GHz, which is the highest frequency reported in any silicon-based amplifier.},

abstract={A dc-20-GHz multiple-return-to-zero digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is proposed for direct radio frequency synthesis. To minimize frequency-dependent amplitude and phase errors in the output summing node, which can dominate linearity performance at GHz and mm-wave frequencies, a vertically stacked tree (VST) and feed-forward (FF) path are proposed. While the VST minimizes variation in frequency response among the MSB cells, the FF path improves matching between the MSBs and LSBs, providing up to 21-dB improvement in simulated spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at 20 GHz. To account for additional errors introduced by process variation, the DAC utilizes per-cell calibration of both amplitude and timing. The DAC is implemented in a 0.13-μm SiGe process with an area of 6.25 mm2 and consumes 1.91 W. After amplitude and timing calibration, >48-dB SFDR and lesser than -46 dBc intermodulation distortion are achieved from dc to 20 GHz.},

abstract={Chopping the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) of the input integrator in a CTΔΣM is a traditional and effective way of addressing flicker noise in such modulators. Unfortunately, chopping leads to aliasing of shaped quantization noise into the signal band and degrades performance. We analyze the mechanisms of shaped-noise aliasing in OTA-RC integrators that use two-stage feedforward compensated OTAs, and show that aliasing can be largely mitigated by using an finite impulse response feedback digital-to-analog converter with its zeros placed at multiples of twice the chopping frequency. The theory is borne out by measurement results from a single-bit CTΔΣM, which achieves a peak SNDR of 98.5 dB in a 24-kHz bandwidth while consuming only 280 μW from a 1.8-V supply. Realized in a 180-nm CMOS technology, it achieves a 1/f noise corner of about 3 Hz when chopped at fs/24.},

abstract={Future many cores, either for high performance computing or for embedded applications, are facing the power wall, and cannot be scaled up using only the reduction of technology nodes; 3D integration, using through silicon via (TSV) as an advanced packaging technology, allows further system integration, while reducing the power dissipation devoted to system-level communication. In this paper, we present a 3D modular and scalable network-on-chip (NoC) architecture implemented using robust asynchronous logic. The 3DNOC circuit targets a Telecom long-term evolution application; it is composed of two die layers, fabricated in 65 nm technology using TSV middle aspect ratio 1:8, and integrates ESD protection, a 3D design-for-test, and a fault tolerant scheme. The 3D links achieve 0.66 pJ/b energy consumption and 326 Mb/s data rate per pin for the parallel link. Thin die effect is demonstrated by thermal analysis and measurements, as well as the dynamic self-adaptation of the 3D link performances with 3D thermal conditions. Finally, the scalability of the 3DNOC circuit, in terms of power delivery network and thermal dissipation, is demonstrated by using simulations up to a 3D stack of eight die layers.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={2}, 
pages={592-604}, 
abstract={This paper presents a high-throughput, energy-efficient, and scalable low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder with time-domain (TD) signal processing. The proposed arbiter-based minimum value finder is able to support practical long codes. The latency for determining the first two minimum values required in the check node unit is significantly reduced through TD processing. A layered Q-based decoding architecture together with the associated scheduling is proposed in order to reduce the amount of memory used for check node storage. Multimode operations are supported by leveraging the structure of the base matrices and the proposed scalable minimum finder architecture. As a proof of concept, a TD-based multimode LDPC decoder for high-speed IEEE 802.15.3c is designed and fabricated in a 90-nm CMOS process. The LDPC decoder integrates 495k logic gates in 2.25 mm2 and achieves a throughput of 5.28 Gb/s at 157 MHz from a 1.05 V supply voltage. The power and normalized energy dissipation are 182 mW and 34.47 pJ/b, respectively. The proposed LDPC decoder is more hardware and energy efficient than previous digital counterparts and is able to support long codes for practical applications, which is still infeasible for the state-of-the-art TD-based LDPC decoders.},

abstract={This paper presents a power delivery monitor (PDM) peripheral integrated in a flip-chip packaged 28 nm system-on-chip (SoC) for mobile computing. The PDM is composed entirely of digital standard cells and consists of: 1) a fully integrated VCO-based digital sampling oscilloscope; 2) a synthetic current load; and 3) an event engine for triggering, analysis, and debug. Incorporated inside an SoC, it enables rapid, automated analysis of supply impedance, as well as monitoring supply voltage droop of multi-core CPUs running full software workloads and during scan-test operations. To demonstrate these capabilities, we describe a power integrity case study of a dual-core ARM Cortex-A57 cluster in a commercial 28 nm mobile SoC. Measurements are presented of power delivery network (PDN) electrical parameters, along with waveforms of the CPU cluster running test cases and benchmarks on bare metal and Linux OS. The effect of aggressive power management techniques, such as power gating on the dominant resonant frequency and peak impedance, is highlighted. Finally, we present measurements of supply voltage noise during various scan-test operations, an often-neglected aspect of SoC power integrity.},

title={A 2.4-GHz ZigBee Transmitter Using a Function-Reuse Class-F DCO-PA and an ADPLL Achieving 22.6% (14.5%) System Efficiency at 6-dBm (0-dBm) $P_{\mathrm {out}}$}, 
year={2017},

abstract={This paper describes a sub-1-V 2.4-GHz ZigBee transmitter (TX) with scalable output power (Pout) and system efficiency. It features a function-reuse class-F topology unifying the digital-controlled oscillator (DCO) and power amplifier (PA), designated as DCO-PA. Unlike the existing current-reuse topologies that rely on transistor stacking, here the power consumption of the DCO and PA-driver is absorbed into the DCO-PA without losing the voltage headroom, while allowing a low supply voltage. The DCO-PA also benefits from a six-port transformer with customized coupling coefficients and turn ratios to jointly perform the functions of resonant tank and output matching network, saving the chip area. A fractional-N all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) realizes a two-point data modulation. Its phase-interpolated time-to-digital converter prevents time-consuming calibration. The entire TX fabricated in 65-nm CMOS occupies a 0.39-mm2 active area. The standalone DCO-PA shows a peak efficiency of 26.2% at a 6-dBm Pout, and a back-off efficiency of 17.7% at a -4.3 dBm Pout under a scalable supply voltage (0.3-0.7 V). The system efficiency, including the ADPLL, is 22.6% (14.5%) at 6-dBm (0-dBm) Pout. The HS-OQPSK modulated output complies with the ZigBee spectral mask with an adequate margin and the error vector magnitude is 2.29%.},

abstract={This paper presents a pixel pitch-matched readout chip for 3-D photoacoustic (PA) imaging, featuring a dedicated signal conditioning and delta-sigma modulation integrated within a pixel area of 250 μm by 250 μm. The proof-of-concept receiver was implemented in an STMicroelectronics's 28-nm Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator technology, and interfaces to a 4 × 4 subarray of capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs). The front-end signal conditioning in each pixel employs a coarse/fine gain tuning architecture to fulfill the 90-dB dynamic range requirement of the application. The employed delta-sigma beamforming architecture obviates the need for area-consuming Nyquist ADCs and thereby enables an efficient in-pixel A/D conversion. The per-pixel switched-capacitor ΔΣ modulator leverages slewing-dominated and area-optimized inverter-based amplifiers. It occupies only 1/4th of the pixel, and its area compares favorably with state-of-the-art designs that offer the same SNR and bandwidth. The modulator's measured peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio is 59.9 dB for a 10-MHz input bandwidth, and it consumes 6.65 mW from a 1V supply. The overall subarray beamforming approach improves the area per channel by 7.4 times and the single-channel SNR by 8 dB compared to prior art with similar delay resolution and power dissipation. The functionality of the designed chip was evaluated within a PA imaging experiment, employing a flip-chip bonded 2-D CMUT array.},

title={An 8K H.265/HEVC Video Decoder Chip With a New System Pipeline Design}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={1}, 
pages={113-126}, 
abstract={8K ultra-HD is being promoted as the next-generation video specification. While the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard greatly enhances the feasibility of 8K with a doubled compression ratio, its implementation is a challenge, owing to ultrahigh-throughput requirements and increased complexity per pixel. The latter comes from the new features of HEVC. At the system level, the most challenging of them is the enlarged and highly variable-size coding/prediction/transform units, which significantly increase the requirement for on-chip memory as pipeline buffers and the difficulty in maintaining pipeline utilization. This paper presents an HEVC decoder chip featuring a system pipeline that works at a nonunified and variable granularity. The pipeline saves on-chip memory with a novel block-in-block-out queue system and a parameter delivery network, while allowing overhead-free and fully pipelined operation of the processing components. With the system pipeline design combined with various component-level optimizations, the proposed decoder in 40 nm achieves a maximum throughput of 4 Gpixels/s or 8K 120 frames/s for the low-delay-P configuration of HEVC, 7.5-55 times faster than prior works. It supports 8K 60 frames/s for the low-delay and random-access configurations. In a normalized comparison, it also shows 3.1-3.6 times better area efficiency and 31%-55% superior energy efficiency.},

title={Postsilicon Voltage Guard-Band Reduction in a 22 nm Graphics Execution Core Using Adaptive Voltage Scaling and Dynamic Power Gating}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={1}, 
pages={50-63}, 
abstract={In high volume manufacturing, conventional approach to deal with inverse-temperature dependence (ITD) and aging is to add a post silicon flat voltage guard band to all dies based on testing a small random sample of dies. Although this scheme guarantees error-free operation, it significantly degrades energy efficiency, as it penalize all dies for the maximum delay degradation due to ITD and aging as seen by the worst case die, while also assuming maximum aging condition. In this paper, a graphics execution core implemented in 22 nm trigate process uses per-die tunable replica circuit (TRC) to monitor delay degradation due to ITD and actual aging conditions. TRC triggers adaptive voltage scaling to dynamically adjust VCC as needed during run time to maintain correct operation at minimum additional voltage. Measured data show up to 33% (14%) energy savings at 0.4 V (0.8 V) compared with baseline scheme. The TRC is also utilized in a dynamic power gating (DPG) scheme to lower energy overhead due to fast droop guard band. DPG introduces a load line effect during normal operation, thus saving energy, while deactivating this load line upon droop detection by the TRC to maintain ISO performance as baseline. Silicon data show that DPG can improve energy efficiency by 14.5% (7%) at 0.8 V (0.6 V).},

abstract={A novel phase-noise-filtering technique based on phase-domain averaging is proposed to suppress the large injection spurs and poor high-frequency phase noise of inductor-less injection-locked phase-locked loops (IL-PLLs). Demonstrated using a 1.2-GHz fractional-N IL-PLL based on a capacitive-ring-coupled ring oscillator, wideband spur-and-phase-noise suppression of up to 20 dB is achieved allowing for phase noise as low as -146 dBc/Hz at 30-MHz offset with a 2-MHz resolution. This allows for an inductor-less alternative to LC-based PLLs in scaled-digital CMOS technologies. The 65-nm CMOS prototype improves 10-MHz phase noise from -115 to -135 dBc/Hz, injection spurs from -40.5 to -57 dB, and integrated jitter from 3.57 to 1.48 ps while occupying an area of 0.6 mm2 and consuming 19.8 mW from a 0.85-V supply, resulting in an FoM and FoMJitter of -163 and -223.6 dB, respectively.},

abstract={An area-efficient voltage-sensing readout circuit employing chopped voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) is presented in this paper. This VCO-based CTDSM features direct connection to sensors to eliminate pre-amplifier for achieving better hardware efficiency. The VCO is designed as a trans-conductor current-controlled oscillator, which is a fully differential Gm stage cascaded with two CCOs, to provide a high-input impedance to sense the voltage signals from sensors. Analysis shows that the main noise and offset contributor is the Gm stage. This problem is mitigated by employing choppers at critical location within the circuit. The VCO-based CTDSM is implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process. The power consumption is 17 μW under 1.2V supply. With a 4-mVp (8-mVpp) input, it achieves 61.85-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio over a 5-kHz bandwidth and the total harmonic distortion is -70.8 dB. The input-referred noise is 32 nV/√Hz.

abstract={This paper presents a fully integrated resonant regulating rectifier (IR3) with an on-chip coil used to wirelessly power mm-sized implants. By combining rectification and regulation in a single stage, and controlling this stage via a hybrid pulse-width modulation and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) feedback scheme, the IR3 avoids efficiency-limiting cascaded losses while enabling tight voltage regulation with low dropout and ripple. The IR3 is implemented in 0.078 mm2 of active area in 180-nm Silicon oxide insulator (SOI) CMOS, and achieves a 1.87% AVDD/VDD power supply regulation ratio with a 1-nF decoupling capacitor despite a tenfold load current variation from 8 to 80 μA. A 0.8-V VDD is maintained at a 8-kΩ load for 144-MHz RF inputs ranging from 0.98 to 1.5 V. At 1-V regulation, the voltage conversion efficiency is greater than 92% with less than 5.2-mVpp ripple, while the power conversion efficiency is 54%. The measured overall wireless power transfer system efficiency, from the primary coil to VDD output of the IR3, is 2% at 160-μW load, and reaches 5% at 700 μW.},

abstract={Pushed by the ever-increasing demand of internet traffic, high-speed serial interfaces are expected to reach 400-Gb/s aggregate data rates in near future. At receiver (RX) side, phase rotators (PRs) are key blocks to align the phase of the local clock to the transitions of the incoming data and to sample the eye in the optimal position. Small phase step and high linearity are paramount in preserving the horizontal time margin, tightened by the reduced symbol duration at 25 Gb/s and beyond. Interpolation of π/4-spaced signals is a viable means of improving linearity at high resolution, provided multi-phase signals with low phase error are available. An injection-locked ring oscillator (ILRO) with a mixed analog and digital calibration loop is proposed for high accuracy multi-phase generation over a wide frequency range and against large voltage and temperature variations. A phase detector (PD) based on two passive mixers measures the quadrature error and continuously tunes the oscillator to achieve low phase error. Concurrently, a window comparator monitors the PD output and drives digital coarse calibration in background. Two test chips have been fabricated in 28-nm CMOS fully depleted silicon on insulator technology. The stand-alone ILRO demonstrates 0.2-11.7 GHz frequency range with better than 1.5° quadrature phase error over ±20% supply and -40 °C to +120 °C temperature variations. Power consumption is scalable from 3 to 15 mW. When the ILRO drives the 7-bit PR, it demonstrates differential and integral non-linearity within 0.5 and 1.1 LSB, respectively, across the 2-11 GHz frequency range with 18.6-mW maximum power dissipation. Measured performances compare favorably against the state of the art and meet the requirements of >25 Gb/s multi-standard I/O RXs.},

abstract={This paper presents a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) switched-capacitor (SC) dc-dc converter that only uses the parasitic capacitance already present in fully integrated SC power converters to generate multiple dc voltages. When used in an SC converter together with the scalable parasitic charge redistribution technique, the presented MIMO converter provides additional voltage rails, which can be used to power gate drivers or control blocks without any area overhead. Moreover, because the proposed converter only makes use of elements, which are already present in fully integrated SC converters, only conductive losses are introduced. This means that, for low output powers, efficiencies arbitrarily close to 100% can be achieved. The presented type of converter is characterized using an MIMO model, which is, in turn, used to prove the efficiency of the converter compared with regular SC MIMO converters, particularly for a large number of inputs or outputs. Measurements verify the basic working principle of the presented converter, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 98.9% and output powers sufficient to power internal converter blocks.},

abstract={Although there is much active research on software-defined radios (SDRs) with receive (RX) or transmit (TX) functionality, little work has been done on SDR transceivers supporting frequency division duplex (FDD). In this paper, we present a new circuit concept in which a distributed TX circuit cancels the transmitted signal at a reverse RX port through destructive interference while adding signal constructively at a forward TX port. We pair the distributed transmitter with a receiver-tracking PA degeneration technique to suppress the injected noise from TX circuits in the RX band. The system does not require off-chip filters or circulators, but still achieves both SDR flexibility and both FDD and time division duplex function. Measurements from the transceiver implemented in 65-nm CMOS show a frequency tuning range of 0.3-1.6 GHz with TX-RX isolation >23 dB and transmitted power up to 19 dBm.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={1}, 
pages={8-20}, 
abstract={Modern multicore processors employ multiple phase-locked loops (PLLs) to operate individual cores at a power-optimal frequency. This paper presents techniques to implement such PLLs in a small area. The area occupied by classical charge-pump-based analog PLLs is mostly due to the large loop filter capacitor needed to implement the integral control portion of type-II response. Digital PLLs (DPLL) can eliminate the capacitor by implementing the integral control in digital domain but their jitter performance is degraded by the quantization error introduced by DPLL building blocks such as a time-to-digital converter (TDC). We seek to combine the advantages of analog (no quantization error) and digital (small area) PLLs by implementing the integral control using time-based techniques. To this end, a ring oscillator-based integrator (ROI) is used to implement the integral control. ROI integrates its input and generates an output in the form of a pulse-width modulated (PWM) signal. While the ROI does not introduce quantization error, controlling the voltage controlled oscillator with the PWM signal introduces undesirable spurious tones. We propose to use a pseudo-differential ROI to mitigate these tones and achieve good jitter performance. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS LP process, the prototype PLL occupies an active area of only 0.0021 mm2 and operates across a supply voltage range of 0.6 V to 1.2 V providing 0.4-2.6 GHz output frequencies. At 2.2 GHz output frequency, the PLL consumes 1.82 mW at 1 V supply voltage, and achieves 3.73 psrms integrated jitter. This translates to an FoMJ of -226.0 dB, which compares favorably with state-of-the-art designs while occupying the smallest reported active area.},

abstract={A 40-nm microcontroller featuring voltage stacked memory and logic is presented. This involved connecting the power domains of the memory and logic in series, such that the ground of one power domain is connected to the positive supply rail of the other. In this paper, an ARM Cortex-M0+ and its peripherals are powered from 0 V to VDD, while its 4-kB ROM and the 16-kB SRAM are powered from VDD to 2 VDD. Since the memory and logic will, in general, draw different supply currents, the midrail VDD is provided by an on-chip switched capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR). To allow a direct comparison of voltage stacking with a conventional single supply, it can be turned off by configuring the SCVR to power both the memory and logic from 0 V and VDD. Turning on voltage stacking results in 96% power conversion efficiency, while the active converter area is reduced by 2.6×. Despite the use of a smaller SCVR, the voltage stacking reduces the supply noise by 3.4 dB and the output voltage drops from 58 to 36 mV.},

abstract={This paper proposes a digital-to-time converter (DTC)-assisted fractional-N wide-bandwidth all-digital phaselocked loop (ADPLL) with a fine-resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC). The TDC employs a two-channel time-interleaved time-domain register with an implicit adder/subtractor realizing an error-feedback topology. Such an error-feedback unit of a first-order ΔΣ-TDC can be cascaded as a multi-stage noise shaping configuration to achieve higher-order noise-shaping and, thereby, low in-band phase noise (PN) of the ADPLL. A digitally controlled oscillator with a transformer and a pair of cross-coupled NMOS amplifiers exploits magnetic and capacitive coupling to achieve nearly an octave frequency coverage, i.e., 1.73-3.38 GHz (after a ÷2 division). Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the ADPLL achieves better than -110-dBc/Hz in-band PN and occupies an active area of 0.5 mm2. With a 50-MHz reference clock, a 2-GHz output RF clock, and a loop bandwidth of 800 kHz, this prototype achieves 420-fsrms jitter, integrated from 1-kHz to 30-MHz offset, while drawing 10.7 mW.},

title={A Nyquist Rate SAR ADC Employing Incremental Sigma Delta DAC Achieving Peak SFDR = 107 dB at 80 kS/s}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={PP}, 
number={99}, 
pages={1-15}, 
abstract={This paper introduces an architecture and design for high-resolution high-linearity Nyquist rate successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) using a hybrid capacitive and incremental ΣΔ digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The proposed architecture benefits from an intrinsically linear 1.5-bit ΣΔ DAC to resolve the fine bits of the SAR ADC after a coarse conversion phase with a monotonically switched capacitive DAC (CDAC). The achieved linearity relies neither on a highly matched CDAC nor on any dynamic linearization techniques but on a single calibration of the coarse CDAC using the available ΣΔ DAC at startup. Therefore, the CDAC can be sized solely upon noise requirements. The SAR ADC employs two parallel dynamic comparators for improved power efficiency. A prototype was fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS, with power supplies of 1.1 and 2.5 V. It occupies an active area of only 0.074 mm². The prototype achieves a measured peak spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 107 dB and peak signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 84.8 dB dB at 80-kS/s Nyquist rate operation with 5.3-kHz input. The measured performance at the Nyquist frequency, limited by signal source quality, is SFDR = 99.5 dB and SNDR = 83.5 dB. The core power consumption is 110 μW. In oversampling mode, the ADC achieves an SNDR above 90 dB over a 5-kHz bandwidth.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel switching-converter-free ac-dc light-emitting diode (LED) driver with low-frequency-flicker reduction for general lighting applications. The proposed driving solution can minimize the system size as it enables the monolithic integration of the controller and power transistors while both the bulky off-chip electrolytic capacitors and magnetics are eliminated. Moreover, the driver can effectively reduce the harmful optical flicker at the double-line-frequency by employing a novel quasi-constant power control scheme while maintaining high efficiency and a good power factor (PF). The proposed driver is implemented with a single controller integrated circuit chip, which includes the controller and high-voltage power transistors, and the off-chip diode bridge and valley-fill circuit. The chip is fabricated with a 0.35-μm 120-V high-voltage CMOS process and occupies 1.85 mm2. The driver can provide up to 7.8-W power to the LED and achieves 87.6% peak efficiency and an over 0.925 PF with only 17.3% flicker from a 110-Vac 60-Hz input.},

title={All-Digital LTE SAW-Less Transmitter With DSP-Based Programming of RX-Band Noise}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3434-3445}, 
abstract={We present the first all-digital LTE transmitter (TX) using programmable digital attenuation of receive band (RX-band) noise. The system is architectured to fully exploit the speed and low cost of DSP logic in deep-submicrometer CMOS processes, without increasing at all the design effort of the RF circuitry. To achieve operation without surface acoustic wave filter, the TX uses digital bandpass delta-sigma modulation and mismatch-shaping to attenuate the DAC noise at a programmable duplex distance. These functions can be implemented entirely within DSP, thus taking advantage of the standard digital design methodology. Furthermore, the fully digital RX-band noise shaping significantly relaxes the performance requirements on the RF front-end. Therefore, 10 bits of resolution for the D/A conversion are sufficient to achieve -160 dBc/Hz out-of-band (OOB) noise, without need for digital predistortion, calibration, or bulky analog filters. The TX was fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, and occupies only 0.82 mm2. Besides low OOB noise, our system also demonstrates state-of-art linearity performance, with measured CIM3/CIM5 below -67 dBc, and adjacent-channel leakage ratio of -61 dBc with LTE20 carrier. The circuit consumes 150 mW from 0.9-/1.5-V supplies at +3 dBm output power.},

abstract={This paper presents a packaged 76- to 81-GHz transceiver chip implemented in SiGe BiCMOS for both long-range and short-range automotive radars. The chip contains a two-channel transmitter (TX), a six-channel receiver (RX), a local-oscillator (LO) chain, and built-in self-test (BIST) circuitry. Each transmit channel includes multiple variable-gain amplifiers and a two-stage power amplifier. Measured on-die output power per channel is +18 dBm at 25 °C, decreasing to +16 dBm at 125 °C. Each receive channel includes a current-mode mixer, followed by intermediate-frequency buffers. At 25 °C, measured on-die noise figure is 10-11 dB, conversion gain is 14-15 dB, and input 1-dB compression point exceeds +1 dBm. An integrated LO chain drives the transmit and receive chains and includes an 18.5- to 20.6-GHz voltage-controlled oscillator connected to cascaded frequency doublers and a divide-by-four prescaler. At 25 °C, measured phase noise is -100 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset from a 77-GHz carrier. Integrated BIST circuits enable the measurement of signal power, RX gain, channel-to-channel phase, and internal temperature. The chip is flip-chip packaged into a ball-grid array and extracted interconnect loss for the package is 1.5 to 2 dB. Total power consumption for the chip is 1.8 W from 3.3 V for a single-TX, six-RX mode.},

In this paper, a spatial-orthogonal ASK transmitter architecture is presented. The self-sustaining oscillator-based transmitter architecture has an ultra-compact size and excellent power efficiency. With the proposed high-speed constant-load switch, significantly reduced modulation loss is achieved. Using polarization diversity and multi-level modulation, the throughput is largely enhanced. Array configuration is also adopted to enhance the link budget for higher signal quality and longer communication range.

abstract={A high-speed 2b-1b/cycle two-step successive-approximation-register analog-to-digital converter (ADC) exploiting the passive residue transfer technique is reported. The removal of the residue amplifier results in savings in the time and power consumed by the residue transfer process.

The use of the 2b-1b/cycle hybrid conversion scheme with an appropriate resolution partition further enhances the conversion speed. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype ADC measured a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio of 43.7 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range of 58.1 dB for a near-Nyquist input. The total power consumption of the ADC is 5 mW and the achieved figure of merit is 35 fJ/conversion-step, all measured at a sample rate of 1.2 GS/s.},

year={2017},

number={99}, 
pages={1-11}, 
abstract={A low-jitter and low-reference-spur ring-type voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based switched-loop filter (SLF) phase-locked loop (PLL) is presented. To enhance the capability of suppressing jitter of a VCO, we propose a fast phase-error correction (FPEC) technique that emulates the phase-realignment mechanism of an injection-locked clock multiplier. By the proposed FPEC technique, accumulated jitter of a VCO can be removed intensively in a short interval, thereby suppressing jitter dramatically. Based on a PLL topology having an intrinsic integrator in a VCO, the proposed architecture can also achieve a low reference spur despite a high multiplication factor (i.e., 64). This paper also presents the selective frequency-tuning technique used in the VCO that helps the proposed architecture further suppress the level of reference spur. The proposed PLL was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. The measured rms jitter integrated from 1 kHz to 80 MHz and the reference spur of the output signal with a 3.008-GHz frequency were 357 fs and -71 dBc, respectively. The total active area was 0.047 mm², and the power consumption was 4.6 mW.},

title={Arbitrary Analog/RF Spatial Filtering for Digital MIMO Receiver Arrays}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3392-3404}, 
abstract={Traditional digital multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers that feature element-level digitization face high instantaneous dynamic range challenges in the analog/RF domain due to the absence of analog/RF spatial filtering. Existing analog/RF spatial notch filtering techniques are limited in their noise, linearity, and spatial filtering bandwidth performance. More importantly, only single spatial notches have been demonstrated, providing insufficient filtering in practical scenarios. We propose a frequency-translational arbitrary spatial filtering technique that features not only arbitrary spatial filtering response generation at baseband for the protection of the following analog-to-digital converters, but modulated baseband input impedance that can be translated by passive mixers to achieve arbitrary spatial filtering at RF as well. This technique allows the synthesis and independent steering of an arbitrary number of spatial notches, and the independent adjustment of notch depths. Current-mode operation leads to superior linearity performance and ultra-wideband rejection. A four-element 65-nm CMOS 0.1-3.1 GHz prototype MIMO receiver array shows arbitrary spatial response formation, more than 50-dB spatial rejection across all measured directions, and an ultra-wide 320-MHz 20-dB rejection bandwidth for a single-notch setting at 500-MHz local oscillator (LO) frequency. Formation of a single spatial notch only moderately degrades the equivalent single-element double-sideband noise figure from 2.1-3.7 dB to 3.4-5.8 dB. In the notch direction, +34 dBV in-band output-referred IP3 is measured, an improvement of 33 dB compared with outside-notch directions. A wireless demonstration shows the receiver array demodulating a weak spatial signal in the presence of two strong in-band spatial signals, verifying the arbitrary spatial filtering functionality.},

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={4}, 
pages={972-984}, 
abstract={We present a discontinuous harvesting approach for switch capacitor dc-dc converters that enables ultralow-power energy harvesting. Smart sensor applications rely on ultralow-power energy harvesters to scavenge energy across a wide range of ambient power levels and charge the battery. Based on the key observation that energy source efficiency is higher than charge pump efficiency, we present a discontinuous harvesting technique that decouples the two efficiencies for a better tradeoff. By slowly accumulating charge on an input capacitor and then transferring it to a battery in burst mode, dc-dc converter switching and leakage losses can be optimally traded off with the loss incurred by nonideal maximum power point tracking operation. Harvester duty cycle is automatically modulated instead of charge pump operating frequency to match with the energy source input power level. The harvester uses a hybrid structure called a moving-sum charge pump for low startup energy upon a mode switch, an automatic conversion ratio modulator based on conduction loss optimization for fast conversion ratio increment, and a <;15-pW asynchronous mode controller for ultralow-power operation. In 180-nm CMOS, the harvester achieves >40% end-to-end efficiency from 113 pW to 1.5 μW with 20-pW minimum harvestable input power.},

title={A Millimeter-Wave Non-Magnetic Passive SOI CMOS Circulator Based on Spatio-Temporal Conductivity Modulation}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={12}, 
pages={3276-3292}, 
abstract={Linear, time-invariant, passive circuits and systems constructed from conventional materials with symmetric permittivity and permeability tensors are reciprocal. Breaking Lorentz reciprocity enables the implementation of non-reciprocal components, such as gyrators, isolators, and circulators, which find application in numerous wireless communication systems. Non-reciprocal components are traditionally implemented using ferrite materials, which exhibit the Faraday effect under the application of an external magnetic field bias. However, ferrite materials cannot be integrated into CMOS fabrication processes and require an external biasing magnet, and hence are bulky and expensive. Recently, there has been significant research interest in the implementation of non-magnetic non-reciprocal components using temporal modulation, including a fully integrated 25-GHz circulator in a 45-nm SOI CMOS, demonstrating magneticfree passive non-reciprocity on silicon at millimeter waves for the first time. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the millimeter-wave circulator in both time and frequency domains. Millimeter-wave non-reciprocal operation is enabled by the concept of spatio-temporal conductivity modulation, which achieves broadband non-reciprocal gyrator functionality over theoretically infinite bandwidth (BW). When compared with prior approaches based on N-path filters, spatio-temporal conductivity modulation requires only four-phase 50% duty-cycle clocking at frequencies significantly lower than the operation frequency, enabling scaling to millimeter waves. The 25-GHz circulator achieves minimum transmitter (TX)-to-antenna (ANT)/ANT-to-receiver (RX) insertion losses of 3.3 dB/3.2 dB, respectively, with a 1-dB BW of 4.6 GHz. TX-to-RX isolation is 18.3-21.2 dB (limited by the measurement setup) over the same BW. The circulator IC occupies an area of 1.2 mm × 1.8 mm (λ/8 × λ/6). The spatiotemp- ral conductivity modulation concept is readily scalable across frequency and can be an enabler for higher millimeterwave (e.g., 77 GHz) circulators as well as optical isolators.},

pages={2422-2429}, 
abstract={This paper describes the design of an energy-efficient vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) driver circuit implemented in a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The driver features a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer where positive and negative peaks are added to the main signal to compensate for the low-pass characteristic of VCSELs. The circuit is also able to generate asymmetric pre-emphasis to counteract the VCSEL nonlinearity. Bonded to an 18 GHz VCSEL, the driver can reach an error-free (bit error rate <; 10-12) optical data rate of 50 Gb/s with an horizontal eye opening better than 0.2 unit interval using a 22 GHz photoreceiver without equalization, retiming, and limiting amplifier at the receiver side. At 48 Gb/s, the horizontal eye opening is 0.5 unit interval. The circuit dissipates only 190 mW from a dual supply of 2.5 and 3.3 V, including the VCSEL power. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the fastest common-cathode VCSEL driver with lowest power consumption for data rates higher than 35 Gb/s. Thanks to the active delay line and the application of vertical inductor, the driver is very compact with an active area of only 0.036 mm2 including the inductor.},

The digital processor consists of multiple blocks implementing an automatic sleep staging algorithm that uses a set of contextual decision trees controlled by a state machine. The processor is designed to stay in the idle mode at most times waking up only when computations are required. In addition, the mathematical operations are implemented in a way such that the number of datapath components needed is very small. The SoC is implemented in an AMS 0.18-μm CMOS technology and is powered using a single 1.25-V supply. Its power consumption is measured to be 575 μW, while its classification accuracy using real EEG data is 98.7%.},

abstract={This paper presents a CMOS image sensor (CIS) that extracts a multi-level edge image as well as a human-friendly normal image in a real time from conventional pixels for machine-vision applications, utilizing a proposed speed/power efficient dual-mode successive-approximation register analog-todigital converter (SAR ADC). The proposed readout scheme operates in two modes, fine step SAR (FS-SAR) mode and coarsestep single-slope (CS-SS) mode, depending on the difference (A) between a chosen pixel and the previous pixel. If a chosen pixel is at a boundary of an object with a large A from the previous pixel, the readout ADC works in the CS-SS mode to readout the edge strength (ES), while the FS-SAR mode is applied for other pixels. By displaying the ES, a multi-level edge image can be obtained in a real time along with a normal image with no hardware/time overhead. By saving the MSBs conversion cycles regardless of A, the proposed dual-mode readout scheme enhances the readout speed and reduces power consumption. A prototype QQVGA CIS with 10-bit SAR ADCs was fabricated in a 0.18-μm 1P4M CMOS image sensor process with a 4.9-μm pixel pitch. With a maximum pixel rate of 61.4 Mp/s, the prototype demonstrated figure of merits of 70 pJ/pixel/frame, 0.35 e̅ nJ, and 0.34 e̅ pJ/step.},

pages={139-150}, 
abstract={The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance is strongly dependent upon the robust image recognition technology such as lane detection, vehicle/pedestrian detection, and traffic sign recognition. However, the conventional ADAS cannot realize more advanced collision evasion in real environments due to the absence of intelligent vehicle/pedestrian behavior analysis. Moreover, accurate distance estimation is essential in ADAS applications and semiglobal matching (SGM) is most widely adopted for high accuracy, but its system-on-chip (SoC) implementation is difficult due to the massive external memory bandwidth. In this paper, an ADAS SoC with behavior analysis with Artificial Intelligence functions and hardware implementation of SGM is proposed. The proposed SoC has dual-mode operations of high-performance operation for intelligent ADAS with real-time SGM in D-Mode (d-mode) and ultralow-power operation for black box system in parking-mode. It features: 1) task-level pipelined SGM processor to reduce external memory bandwidth by 85.8%; 2) region-of-interest generation processor to reduce 86.2% of computation; 3) mixed-mode intention prediction engine for dual-mode intelligence; and 4) dynamic voltage and frequency scaling control to save 36.2% of power in d-mode. The proposed ADAS processor achieves 862 GOPS/W energy efficiency and 31.4GOPS/mm2 area efficiency, which are 1.53× and 1.75× improvements than the state of the art, with 30 frames/s throughput under 720p stereo inputs.},

title={Watt-Level mm-Wave Power Amplification With Dynamic Load Modulation in a SiGe HBT Digital Power Amplifier}, 
year={2017},

pages={371-388}, 
abstract={Performance limits and design techniques for Watt-level power amplification at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies using silicon germanium (SiGe) HBT Class-E power amplifiers (PAs) is presented in this paper. A Class-E power modulator architecture is proposed for demonstrating highspeed data transmission using ASK modulation at mm-wave frequencies. Several of these 1-b power modulators are power combined to realize a Watt-level digital PA with several levels of output amplitude at mm-wave frequencies. A dynamic load modulation concept is proposed to mitigate the effect of load pulling in the digital PA at power back-off. A tunable transmission line architecture with variable characteristic impedance is proposed to realize this dynamic load modulation network and enable efficiency enhancement at power back-off levels in the Watt-level digital PA. Watt-level power generation at mm-waves was demonstrated in a eight-way combined digital PA with dynamic load modulation, fabricated in a 0.13-μm SiGe BiCMOS process with ≈29 dBm (0.8 W) measured output power at 46 GHz, 18.4% peak power-added-efficiency, and 60% of the peak efficiency at 6-dB power back-off.},

volume={52}, 
number={5}, 
pages={1358-1372}, 
abstract={Recently, we demonstrated the first CMOS nonmagnetic nonreciprocal passive circulator based on N-path filters that uses time variance to break reciprocity. Here, the analysis of performance metrics, such as loss, isolation, linearity, and tuning range, is presented in terms of the design parameters. The analysis is verified by the measured performance of a 65-nm CMOS circulator prototype that exhibits 1.7 dB of loss in the transmitter-antenna (TX-ANT) and antenna-receiver (ANT-RX) paths, and has high isolation [TX-RX, up to 50 dB through tuning and 20-dB bandwidth (BW) of 32 MHz] and a tuning range of 610-850 MHz. Through an architectural feature specifically designed to enhance TX linearity, the circulator achieves an in-band TX-ANT input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of +27.5 dBm, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the ANT-RX IIP3 of +8.7 dBm. The circulator is also integrated with a self-interference-canceling full-duplex (FD) RX featuring an analog baseband (BB) SI canceller. The FD RX achieves 42-dB on-chip SI suppression across the circulator and analog BB domains over a 12-MHz signal BW. In conjunction with digital SI and its input-referred third-order intermodulation (IM3) cancellation, the FD RX demonstrates 85-dB overall SI suppression, enabling an FD link budget of -7-dBm TX average output power and -92-dBm noise floor.},

abstract={This paper describes a short-range transceiver architecture using frequency-hopped sinusoidal OOK pulses. Since signal bandwidth does not necessarily have to satisfy >500 MHz requirement like conventional ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses, the proposed transceiver named as a very-wide band (VWB) transceiver offers degrees of freedom to choose an optimum operation duty cycle in terms of energy efficiency, bandwidth efficiency, and communication range, while providing much lower operation duty cycle than that of narrow band OOK transceiver. The VWB transmission significantly relaxes the complexity of transceiver design without requiring advanced CMOS technology. In the transmitter, pulse generation circuit design is simplified with the duty-cycled sinusoidal signal compared to that in the impulse-radio UWB (IR-UWB) transmitter. In the receiver, an asynchronous energy detection topology is proposed to achieve robust energy detection by overcoming the synchronization issue as well as the saturation problem of the integrator circuit. A prototype 3-to-4 GHz VWB transceiver is implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS. The transceiver achieves the communication distance of >2 m at 1 Mb/s data rate with the peak-to-peak pulse amplitude of only 300 mV and the duty cycle of 0.6%, consuming 0.42 mW from a 1.8 V supply.},

The symmetrical multiphase converter ring surrounds its load in the square and supplies power to the on-chip power grid that is easily accessible at any point of the chip edges. The frequency of the VDD-controlled oscillator is adjusted through its supply voltage VDD, which allows the unity-gain frequency to be designed higher than the switching frequency.

year={2017}, 
volume={52}, 
number={8}, 
pages={2194-2207}, 
abstract={Nonvolatile flip-flops (nvFFs) enable frequent-off processors to achieve fast power-off and wake-up time while maintaining critical local computing states through parallel data movement between volatile FFs and local nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices. However, current nvFFs face challenges in large store energy (ES) and long voltage stress time on the device (TSTRESS), due to wide distribution in the write time of NVM device as well as unnecessary writes. Moreover, heavy parasitic load on the power rail cause long wake-up time for restoring data from NVM to FFs. This paper proposes the resistive RAM (ReRAM)-based nvFF with self-write termination (SWT) and reduced loading on power rail to: 1) reduce 93+% waste of ES from fast switching or matched cells; 2) suppress endurance and reliability degradation resulted from overprogramming and long TSTRESS; and 3) achieve reliable and 26+ times faster restore operation compared with previous nvFFs. We have fabricated a nonvolatile processor and a test chip with SWT-nvFFs using logic-process ReRAM in a 65-nm CMOS process. Measured results show sub-2-ns termination response time and sub-20-ns chip-level restore time.},

abstract={This paper presents an all-digital multiphase switched capacitor power amplifier (MP-SCPA) implemented in a 130-nm CMOS. Quadrature architectures suffer reduced output power and efficiency owing to the combination of out-ofphase signals. The MP architecture reduces the phase difference between the basis vectors that are combined, and hence the output power and efficiency are greatly improved. Sixteen clocks with identical adjacent phase separations are produced by a phase generator with each phase's relative amplitude weighted on the top plate of a capacitor array and combined on a common bottom plate, resulting in linear amplification. The MP-SCPA delivers a peak output power Pout of 26 dBm with a peak system efficiency (SE) of 24.9%. When amplifying a long-term evolution signal at 1.85 GHz, the average Pout and the SE are 20.9 dBm and 15.2%, respectively, with an Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) <; -30 dBc and error vector magnitude of 3.5% rms using a 2-D digital predistortion.},

abstract={An active transmitter (TX) cancellation scheme enabling integration of the antenna interface for frequency division duplex systems is presented. A replica of the TX current is synthesized in shunt with the receiver (RX) by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The replica DAC virtually shorts out the TX signal at the RX input while having minimal impact on the TX insertion loss. Propagation of the TX phase noise in the RX band is analyzed and shown to be feed-forward cancelled in the proposed system. A prototype chip including integrated TX, measurement RX, and cancellation circuits, operating on a single-shared antenna, is implemented in 65-nm CMOS. The cancellation replica demonstrates > 50 dB cancellation of a +12.6 dBm peak 20-MHz TX signal across a wide range of center frequencies and up to 5:1 voltage standing-wave ratio at the antenna interface. The RX is able to down-convert the RX signal at 40-MHz offset with <; 4.3 dB noise figure degradation in the presence of the residual TX signal.},

abstract={Existing nonvolatile ternary content-addressable-memory (nvTCAM) suffers from limited word-length (WDL), large write-energy (EW) and search-energy (ES), and large cell area (A). This paper develops a 3T1R nvTCAM cell using a single multiple-level cell (MLC)-resistive RAM (ReRAM) device to achieve long WDL, lower EW and ES, and reduced cell area. Two peripheral control schemes were developed, dual-replica-row selftimed and invalid-entry power consumption suppression (IEPCS), for the suppression of dc current in 3T1R nvTCAM cells in order to reduce ES. Two versions of the IEPCS scheme were developed (basic and charge-recycle-controlled) to alter the tradeoff between area overhead and power consumption in the updating of invalid-bits. A 128 b × 64 b 3T1R nvTCAM macro was fabricated using back-end-of-line ReRAM under 90-nm CMOS process. The fabricated MLC-based 3T1R nvTCAM macro achieved sub-1-ns search-delay and sub-6-ns wake-up time with supply voltage of 1 V and WDL = 64 b.},

pages={327-343}, 
abstract={A low-power FM demodulator operating across a 2-10-GHz IF bandwidth for its application in wideband heterodyne receivers is presented. A four-stage ring oscillator locks to one-fourth of the input FM, thereby reducing the energy required for wideband demodulation. The measurements show that the oscillator is capable of locking to at least a modulating frequency of 400 MHz, and further testing is limited by the FM source. Linear demodulation of the quadrature-phased outputs is realized using a low-power folded CMOS mixer, even as the fractional bandwidth of the input FM approaches unity. The inductorless 65-nm CMOS prototype occupies 0.17 mm2 and dissipates 3.2 mW from 1.2 V at the quiescent point. The measured SNR sensitivity is 8 dB and the demodulator bit-error rate is 0.1% at 10 Mb/s for a 45-mVpp input signal at IF.},

abstract={This paper introduces a hybrid charge pump (HCP) architecture. The HCP enables high-voltage dc outputs in a nanometer-scale CMOS technology at improved power efficiency by optimally mixing different charge pump (CP) types that trade off voltage range and power efficiency. Conventional CP outputs in a bulk CMOS process are limited to a single-diode breakdown voltage (~12 V in a 65-nm technology node). To support >12 V outputs, the HCP extends the voltage tolerance of bulk CMOS substrates via two technology methods: double-diode substrate isolation and field oxide isolation. To enable these isolation methods, two specialized CP cells are devised: an all-nMOS voltage doubler and an improved-drive Dickson-type pump. Two HCP design examples with opposite voltage polarities are implemented in a 65-nm CMOS technology, and their measurement results are discussed. The positive voltage HCP achieves a 36 V output and 49% peak efficiency at a 20-μA load current and occupies 0.18 mm2 in area. This output voltage represents a 3× increase in the technology's voltage range compared to ranges attainable by conventional designs.},

abstract={This paper presents a new dynamic residue amplifier topology for pipelined analog-to-digital converters. With an input signal of 100 mVpp,diff and 4x gain, it achieves -100-dB total harmonic distortion, the lowest ever reported for a dynamic amplifier. Compared to the state of the art, it exhibits 25 dB better linearity with twice the output swing and similar noise performance. The key to this performance is a new linearization technique based on capacitive degeneration, which exploits the exponential voltage-to-current relationship of MOSFET in weak inversion. The prototype amplifier is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process and dissipates only 87 μW at a clock speed of 43 MS/s, thereby improving the energy per cycle by 26x compared with that of state-of-the-art high-linearity amplifiers.},

year={2017},

pages={1605-1617}, 
abstract={We report a high dynamic range (HDR) image sensor with a linear response that overcomes some of the limitations of sensors with pixels with self-reset operation. It operates similar to an active pixel sensor, but its pixels have a novel asynchronous event-based overflow detection mechanism. Whenever the pixel voltages at the integration capacitance reach a programmable threshold, the pixels self-reset and send out asynchronously an event indicating this. At the end of the integration period, the voltage at the integration capacitance is digitized and readout. Combining this information with the number of events fired by each pixel, it is possible to render linear HDR images. Event operation is transparent to the final user. There is no limitation for the number of self-resets of each pixel. The output data format is compatible with frame-based devices. The sensor was fabricated in the AMS 0.18-μm HV technology. A detailed system description and experimental results are provided in this paper. The sensor can render images with an intra-scene dynamic range of up to 130 dB with linear outputs. The pixels' pitch is 25 μm and the sensor power consumption is 58.6 mW.},

abstract={A noise-shifting coupling network is proposed for nonlinear passively coupled quadrature voltage-controlled oscillators (QVCOs). Both detailed analysis and circuit implementation demonstrate that the noise contribution by the coupling network can be minimized by re-aligning the phases of the noise modulation function and the impulse sensitivity function with a reduced magnitude. In addition, the QVCO with the proposed coupling network also incorporates the transformer-feedback technique to improve its performance in terms of phase noise, quadrature phase error, and low supply voltage. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the QVCO prototype operating at 7.9-GHz measures phase noise at 10-MHz offset frequency of -143 dBc/Hz and minimum quadrature phase error of 0.23° while consuming 27.2 mW with a 0.8-V supply voltage.},

abstract={This paper presents a triple-mode, hybrid storage, energy-harvesting power management unit (EH PMU) that interfaces a photovoltaic cell, a regulated load, and a rechargeable battery. The objective is to maximize the end-to-end conversion efficiency of the EH PMU against temporal mismatch and variabilities of harvesting and load power. To minimize the involvement (charging or discharging) of a battery in the voltage conversion process, the proposed hybrid energy storage employs both battery and capacitor, which increases transient energy buffering capability and reduces the overall power conversion loss. Measurement results with 65-nm test chips show that the proposed EH PMU can achieve up to 2.2× higher end-to-end conversion efficiency than the conventional dual-mode architectures under testing cases emulating realistic load and harvesting power variabilities. We also devised a framework for the system design to guide capacitor sizing, buffering voltage range selection, and end-to-end efficiency tradeoffs.},

The digital camera represents this trend well, where image sensor evolution has been responsible for enabling strong market growth. CCD image sensors have contributed to the miniaturization of cameras by their continuous march toward smaller pixel size and improved resolution, leading to more megapixels and enhanced image quality. Recently, the image-sensor shift from CCDs to CMOS has enabled faster capture speeds and convenient HD (High Definition). The result of this evolution has been the impressive growth of the digital camera market. This presentation will illustrate the achievements of image-sensor development, and will outline the corresponding advancements in digital cameras. Further, the future of digital cameras will be elaborated, illustrating the way in which image sensors are leading camera growth .",

        "abstract": "The paramount economic development of the past half-century has been the information revolution (IR). It has given us the personnel computer, the multi-media cell phone, the Internet, and countless other electronic marvels that continuously influence our lives.. The most powerful technological driver of the IR has been the silicon microchip, for two compelling reasons: First, since 1960 the productivity of microchip technology has increased by the astounding factor of one billion times! Concurrently, the performance of microchips, for example of a microprocessor chip, has increased by a factor of approximately one million times since the early 1970s. These two concurrent exponential advances sustained over decades are unmatched in technological history. Consequently, the salient objective of this discussion is to provide an incisive overview of the advance of microchips, in retrospect since 1960, in prospect from 2010 through 2024, and in principle for several following decades.",

The CFIA can also be configured as an opamp which achieves 2\u00c3\u0097 reduction in NEF.",

        "abstract": "Processors have long been the leading edge of integration and process technology and this year's papers emphatically demonstrate that this is still the case. This year's crop of processors exhibit astounding increases in chip integration levels with more cores, special-function units and huge increases in the bandwidth of both on- and off-die interconnect. Emerging markets combine the attributes of network processors (many-threaded low-power cores) and server processors (large cores with virtualization and RAS). Higher levels of memory integration are achieved by using embedded DRAM in these large processors to support the higher-bandwidth demands of throughput computing. The challenges of managing the dramatic growth in dynamic power and leakage (if all integrated components were allowed to activate simultaneously) are addressed with a variety of innovative power management methods such as on-die gating and multiple voltage and frequency domains. Moore's law continues as the first 32nm processors from Intel and AMD are described, together with the latest implementation of the POWER and SPARC architectures.",

        "abstract": "This session highlights circuit techniques for designing in new and emerging technologies such as fully depleted SOI, micro-mechanical switches, organic semiconductors, and 3D integration. Organic semiconductors are getting very popular for large-area electronics due to much lower cost; however, they pose circuit design challenges. 3D integration technology with through-silicon vias is getting a lot of attention to further Moore's law, but need careful design considerations. Researchers have created bold technologies such as micro-mechanical switches to replace semiconductor devices, and designing with them could be a totally different paradigm. This session presents 10 exciting papers covering design challenges to harness benefits of these emerging technologies.",

        "abstract": "The demand for higher bandwidth in chip-to-chip and backplane communication is driven by the video transmission over the internet. This demand has driven the data rates to 10Gb/s and beyond. Currently, there are two approaches to address the increasing bandwidth requirement for high-speed transceivers: one is to increase the number of parallel lines while maintaining the line rate and the other is to increase the data rate per line while maintaining the number of parallel lines. The former eases the requirement for clock and data recovery, as the clock can be forwarded with small overhead. This is applicable to cases where the channel is short and linear equalization is sufficient to compensate for the channel loss. The latter reduces the number of pins on the chips and reduces the board area at the expense of more complicated equalization scheme and techniques for clock and data recovery (CDR). This is applicable to cases where the channel is long and linear equalization is no longer sufficient.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, power management is an essential part of the overall system design of modern highly integrated applications. Not only are strict demands placed on overall power consumption, but sophisticated control of supplies is essential for power dissipation in individual blocks. The design of DC-DC converters in these advanced power management systems is very challenging and is critical to achieving optimal operating performance as well as the overall power efficiency of the systems. These DC-DC converters are not only needed to provide a constant regulated voltage to power up individual building blocks, they also need to provide, in some cases, multiple output voltages for the complex systems or adaptive output voltages for efficiency and performance improvement. All of these goals need to be met with minimum system cost and external components. This session presents different approaches to address these issues.",

As applications grow, flash memory may not be the best fit from many perspectives such random access time, bit alter-ability, and ease of use. For example, in computer applications, improved system performance and cost can be realized by combining non-volatility, byte alterability and high performance in the same memory technology. Traditionally, slower flash memory in conjunction with DRAM has been used. In addition, flash memory is not well suited as an embedded non-volatile memory in SOC platforms due to the added complexity and cost. Up to now expensive flash is integrated into logic technologies to be used in embedded and portable applications.",

        "abstract": "Among all integrated circuits, embedded memory has truly become pervasive and plays an essential role in all of today's VLSI applications such as high-performance computing, low-power and ubiquitous consumer electronics. The rapid reduction of feature size has made it possible to integrate larger and higher performance on-die memories for various logic applications. Technology scaling also creates growing challenges for the embedded memory designer. It is increasingly difficult to scale density while maintaining adequate cell margins for robust read and write operations. The degradation of intrinsic cell design margins, induced by growing device variations, has led to innovative design solutions to overcome these challenges. Among them, advanced peripheral circuit techniques to improve read and write margins have been explored extensively with focus on more intelligent use of power supplies. On-die adaptive design techniques that automatically compensate process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations are also emerging to further improve the design robustness for high-volume manufacturing requirements. While improving and optimizing the transistor characteristics in SRAMs, 1T1C-based DRAM technology (eDRAM) has made significant progress in recent years and it is successfully integrated into leading logic processes. After years of promise, an eDRAM-based large on-die cache now has finally arrived in a high-performance microprocessor.",

        "abstract": "Recently, low-cost silicon optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) have been drawing attention for applications in short-distance optical communications such as chip-to-chip and board-to-board interconnects, LAN, data storage networks, etc [1\u20134]. Particularly, single-chip OEICs with on-chip silicon photodiodes provide a number of advantages including low cost, reduced ground-bounce, and bond-wire-induced coupling. Nevertheless, the slow response of silicon photodiodes in a standard CMOS process serves as a major bottleneck for high-speed communication [1]. To improve the bandwidth of silicon photodiodes, either some process modification or avalanche photodiode implementation has been developed. However, the former results in increased costs, whereas the latter has reliability issues. Although a differential photodiode configuration was originally proposed for bandwidth extension [2\u20134], the operation speed is still limited to several-hundred Mb/s. Meanwhile, the bandwidth can be extended by exploiting equalization filter [1, 3]. For relatively low-Gb/s operations, fixed equalization filter is sufficient, because photodiode responsivity is dominantly determined by diffusion currents which are not sensitive to process and temperature variations. For higher speeds, the responsivity becomes strongly dependent on the process and temperature variations, because it is mainly determined by the carrier mobility. Thereby, equalizers for high-Gb/s optical receivers require an adaptation algorithm to compensate the significant process and temperature variations. In this paper, an OEIC with on-chip photodiode is presented. Bandwidth and responsivity are compensated by a compact adaptive equalizer, thus achieving 8.5Gb/s operation.",

        "abstract": "For many years, successive-approximation ADCs have been the standard architecture for very-low-power and low-speed applications. For moderate-to-high speed applications, other ADC structures such as flash and pipeline have been traditionally the architecture of choice. However, in the recent past, the increasing speed of devices in scaled CMOS technologies has enabled successive-approximation ADCs to penetrate the medium-to-high-speed application domains. Additionally, the lower intrinsic gain of transistors and opamps in scaled CMOS has made the successive-approximation structures more appealing, because in most such implementations an opamp is often not required. Therefore, much recent research activity has been invested in this type of ADCs. In this session, newest advancements in SAR ADCs that push resolution, FoM, and/or speed to the next level are presented.",

When driven by a half-frequency VCO, prototypes in 65 nm CMOS demonstrate a 13.1% tuning range at 115 GHz with a phase noise of -107 dBc/Hz @ 10 MHz offset for a total power dissipation of 12 mW.",

In order to accommodate this goal, wireless communication platforms will be required to support multiple functionalities as well as multiple standards for each function. While advanced CMOS processes allow for higher levels of integration by providing significant area scaling to digital circuits, they impose certain challenges on the radio design. Innovations at the circuit level as well as radio architecture are needed to address these challenges.",

        "abstract": "Digital cellular standards have emerged over the last 20 years. Today, 2G systems like GSM/EDGE are providing worldwide coverage for voice and basic data services. The increasing demand of about 4 billon users has led to high demand for low cost multi-standard, multi-mode and multi-band terminals. RF integration using reconfigurable circuits is a key technology to achieve the required technical performance as well as the even more important cost position. Another important commercial aspect of mobile communication systems is the efficient usage of the available spectrum by cognitive radio techniques. The key for this view of cognitive radio is a reconfigurable RF frontend providing the required flexibility. Therefore the wireless forum will investigate the current status and R&D trends in reconfigurable systems focusing on non-4G based reconfigurable RF and reconfigurable data converters. Target systems include cognitive radio and multi-mode/multi-standard systems including short range systems like Bluetooth and WLAN. The forum will cover reconfigurable RF front-ends, their corresponding reconfigurable A/D converters as well as performance on demand concepts and adaptive power consumption.",

        "abstract": "This Forum is directed toward researchers and designers working in advanced technologies over the next 3-5 years. They will be required to solve emerging issues of signal and power integrity in large, System-on-Chip applications which will raise issues of increasing difficulty. While struggling for higher performance, the designer must battle escalating noise and cross-talk. Interconnect delay and coupling will require new methods of routing and signal transmission. Supply-grid design will take increasing account of limited package and chip metalization through independent power domains, active and passive supply-noise cancellation, and voltage scaling. Increasingly- sensitive analog and RF circuit blocks must counter digital chip noise. Stringent clock-jitter and skew targets, and power-dissipation limitations will be addressed by independent clock domains, resonant clocking, and frequency scaling.",

        "abstract": "As wireless communication systems evolve toward higher frequencies, higher bandwidths, and multi-standard capabilities, the performance of their phase-locked loops (PLLs) becomes increasingly critical to overall system performance. Additionally, PLLs often must be integrated with large digital blocks, so there is strong and increasing economic pressure to implement them in highly-scaled CMOS technology. This short course provides a tutorial explanation of PLL design at both the system and circuit levels in the context of these issues. Topics include integer-N PLLs, fractional-N PLLs, transistor-level design of critical PLL circuit blocks, and practical application-specific PLL issues in a variety of wireless communication systems. The short course is intended for both entry-level and experienced analog, RF, and mixed-signal circuit designers.",

While the hegemony of CMOS integrated circuits in computation and information processing will undoubtedly last into the foreseeable future, researchers from many areas of science and technology have been seeking alternative or complementary solid-state circuit technologies using new physical devices. There also have been pursuits to take CMOS integrated circuits outside their traditional application spaces and use them for new applications. For example: exploitation of electron spins instead of electron charges may pave a new way of information processing; use of ballistic electron motions in vacuum in a solid-state platform and collective electron motions in one dimensional conductors may enable Terahertz electronics; organic integrated circuits have emerged as a means to realize printable, flexible, and wearable electronics; silicon chips directly interfaced with biological samples or living organisms can perform electrical disease screening and genetic analysis, and can be also used for fundamental study of nervous systems.",

        "abstract": "RF testing is an increasingly critical component of modern RF SoC's. While digital logic and memory tests have all become largely automated and inexpensive through built-in self-test (BIST), testing for RF parameter compliance of a wireless standard is time consuming and commands a significant fraction of the total SoC cost. Due to the conventional need for large and expensive RF test equipment, these tests limit the SoC manufacturing throughput (about 3 million cell phones are manufactured per day!) and cannot accommodate other parts of SoC lifecycles, such as on-wafer testing. At the same time, the stakes are much higher in RF SoC's: A failing RF circuit means throwing away the perfectly working digital/memory section occupying most of the die. Recent publications have proposed to exploit the increasing abundance and intelligence of the on-die digital logic to test its RF part in order to reduce the complexity of external test equipment or even eliminate it entirely. With the external equipment bottleneck gone, massively- parallel tests of hundreds or thousands of IC chips can be carried out simultaneously, thus greatly reducing the average test time. Although it imposes limitations, the self-testing can open up new avenues, such as on-wafer or on-die (i.e., pre-packaging) and in-field (i.e., during customer use) verification of RF performance. Since RF-BIST is about manipulating internal signals, it could naturally assist with RF performance to improve parametric yield so that effective yield approaches that of defect density. Digital designers have mastered BIST long ago and now it is time for the RF community to embrace similar ideas. RF circuit and system designers need to pay close attention to it: Self-testing will affect the selection of RF front-end circuitry and architecture so it cannot be merely viewed as something confined to the back-end sections of a modem.",

        "abstract": "The terms \u201cbionics\u201d and \u201cneuroprosthesis\u201d understandably capture the engineers' imagination. Oftentimes, however, this fascination results more from science fiction than actual facts on the reality of unmet clinical needs and the real technical issues of designing a bionic system. Yet not all work in this field is sci-fi, and engineers working with clinical researchers and scientists have realized several milestones in the treatment of chronic diseases. Perhaps the most successful example of a bionic system is the cochlear prosthesis, which has helped restore a measure of hearing in over 150,000 patients, so far. Another active field is neuromodulation, where neurostimulators targeting specific neural circuits are being applied as a therapy for a variety of diseases including Parkinson's disease, incontinence, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Clearly, in the proper context, interfacing silicon circuits to the patients' neural circuits may achieve profound effects.",

        "abstract": "The historical predictability of Moore's Law as a law of economics has enabled the semiconductor industry to not only achieve extraordinary innovation, but overtime has redefined how we build complex electronic systems. We have developed an eco-system of specialized entities to solve specific challenges such as Equipment Development, Foundry Services, Design, EDA, Software, and Consumer Services. While more specialization was an undisputed trend of the past, we are beginning to see hardware companies becoming less specialized - manufacturing companies entering design, design companies enter services to name a few. This change allows for larger fraction of the revenue pie to belong to one entity and perhaps even allowing for recurring revenue to a hardware company thus making economics sustainable. Before the supposed physical limits are reached, what is the right approach that will win and allow Moore's Law of economics to continue its self fulfilling prophecy? More vertically integrated companies that enable recurring revenue? Or more horizontally integrated companies that focus on specialized innovation?",

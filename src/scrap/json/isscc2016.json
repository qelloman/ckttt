       "abstract": "Semiconductors continue to be the foundation for computing and communications solutions, the basis of the Internet of Everthing, and the primary driver in the future of electronics applications. Moore's Law has led to evermore-powerful smart phones, tablets, personal computers, and data centers. It has enabled computing to become a seamless and powerful force in our homes, offices, cars, factories, and much more. Much has been written about the end of Moore's Law. More recently, speculation has focused on the economic end of Moore's Law. Gordon Moore initially projected 10 years of visibility. [35] Over fifty years later, the Moore's Law horizon remains around 10 years. Moore's Law was never guaranteed. It has thrived and will continue to do so as the result of continuous innovation, rigorous planning, and technology execution. Even though it is getting more expensive to build wafers, improvements in density can provide real cost reduction at the most fundamental level, and this economic benefit drives the ability to continue investing in Moore's Law. Innovations have driven Moore's Law through numerous technological transitions and will continue to power us into the future of CMOS and beyond. As long as there is a cost benefit and rich options for future innovations there is no reason to predict an early end!"

This session covers the latest advances in frequency synthesizers and VCOs in GHz and THz frequency ranges. The session begins with a CMOS frequency synthesizer operating above 0.5THz and a 28GHz coupled PLL for mm-Wave 5G applications. The session also presents two GHz-range PLLs, which include a PLL-DLL cascaded structure operating over a wide bandwidth and achieving low phase noise and a high-performance BiCMOS fractional-N synthesizer for backhaul applications. Two VCOs are presented next. The first VCO is a low-power complementary VCO with a low flicker noise corner. This is followed by a 190GHz VCO with very wide tuning range and a time-interleaved ring VCO with a low 1/f3 noise corner. The last two papers describe an injection-locked frequency-locked loop with a self-calibrated locking algorithm and a 2GHz 244fs-resolution digital-to-time converter."

Accordingly, NASA and ESA have developed a wide range of spectroscopic sounding instruments to investigate our solar system. Current LO chains for spectroscopic receivers are implemented with discrete III-V devices and heavy waveguide assemblies. For instance, the 600GHz NASA PISSARRO spectrometer for Europa begins with a 33GHz PLL, tripled to 100GHz, doubled to 200GHz, and then tripled again to 600GHz via multiple waveguides. This LO chain occupies over 3000cm3, weighs 2.5kg, and consumes 11.5W of DC power."

       "abstract": "Demonstrations of mm-Wave arrays with >50 elements in silicon has led to an interest in large-scale mm-Wave MIMO arrays for 5G networks, which promise substantial improvements in network capacity [1,2]. Practical considerations result in such arrays being developed with a tiled approach, where N unit cells with M elements each are tiled to achieve large MIMO/phased arrays with NM elements [2]. Achieving stringent phase-noise specifications and scalable LO distribution to maintain phase coherence across different unit cell ICs/PCBs are a critical challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate a scalable, single-wire-synchronization architecture and circuits for mm-Wave arrays that preserve the simplicity of daisy-chained LO distribution, compensate for phase offset due to interconnects, and provide phase-noise improvement with increasing number of PLLs [3]. Measurements on a scalable 28GHz prototype demonstrate a 21% improvement in rms jitter and a 3.4dB improvement in phase noise at 10MHz offset when coupling 28GHz PLLs across three different ICs."

       "abstract": "Ring-VCO-based PLLs are popular because of their compact chip area and wide tuning range compared with LC-VCO-based PLLs. However, they typically have higher jitter and larger frequency drift due to high sensitivity to PVT variations. Several PLL architectures were proposed to reject the phase noise and reduce the frequency drift [1,2]. However, due to an architecture-level limitation, these phase-noise-rejection PLLs inevitably degrade the settling time. To suppress large phase noise (PN) and supply sensitivity, a Type-III PLL was proposed to provide a large low-frequency loop gain by using a 3rd-order feedback loop [1]. However, high-order feedback loop degrades stability and requires low-frequency compensation zero, which needs a large loop filter and reduces the PN suppression bandwidth. To suppress the phase noise over a wide frequency offset, injection-locked (IL) PLL was proposed by injecting a clean reference into a noisy VCO [2]. But a sub-harmonic injection into a ring-VCO requires a pulse generator, which enhances harmonics but generates large reference spurs. Besides, a race condition between the injection-locking path and the PLL path weakens the locking strength and prolongs settling time by 5 times [2]. In order to reject the phase noise and to minimize supply sensitivity and frequency drift of ring-VCO-based PLLs without compromising other parameters, this paper proposes a 3rd-order PLL employing a cascaded time-amplified clock-skew-sub-sampling DLL, measuring a 4.2μs settling time, 1.05ps integrated jitter, and -113dBc/Hz in-band phase noise with a 3.84mW power consumption at a 2.1GHz output frequency."

       "abstract": "The flourishing of ubiquitous wireless communication networks has pushed the development and deployment of complex RF telecom systems. Concurrently, the IC industry has been making an effort to increase the integration of RF devices. While nanometer CMOS technologies are now dominating end-user devices, the RF domain of wireless infrastructure still suffers from low-scale of integration [1]. Nonetheless, wireless backhaul vendors are now upgrading existing systems, which rely on expensive discrete technologies (i.e. GaAs), and adopting BiCMOS RFICs. A local oscillator (LO) synthesizer is a key block in the implementation of any wireless transceivers. Very tight requirements, in terms of frequency stability and phase noise performance, have led to complex PLL-based monolithic synthesizers. For instance, multi-bit capacitor array VCOs allow the reduction of the VCO tuning gain (Kvco), improving phase-noise performance without frequency coverage penalties. A ΔΣ fractional-N approach has been also introduced to optimize frequency resolution, lock time and noise performance of PLL-based synthesizers [2]."

       "abstract": "An LC oscillator can achieve near optimal performance if the common-mode of the circuit is designed to resonate at twice the oscillation frequency [1-3]. Common-mode resonance can be accomplished with an explicit tail inductor [1] or implicitly by designing the primary resonant tank such that the differential mode is half the common-mode [2,3]. Figures 2.5.1a and 2.5.1b show the NMOS-only and complementary versions [4] of Hegazi's explicit common mode resonance topology, while Fig. 2.5.1c shows a design that employs implicit common-mode resonance. Implicit common-mode resonance has the advantage of a more easily controlled and modelled common-mode and requires one less inductor, but so far has only been applied to NMOS-only oscillators [2,3]. The primary advantage of an NMOS-only design is that, for a given inductance, lower absolute phase noise can be achieved owing to the larger maximum output swing; however, a complementary design is more suitable for low-power applications with more modest phase-noise specifications (such as IoE) where phase noise per unit current and area is important. With an eye to such applications, this paper extends the concept of implicit common-mode resonance to an ultralow power complementary design (i.e. the missing topology in Fig. 2.5.1d)."

Nevertheless, low quality factor of varactors and lossy switches in addition to relatively large parasitic capacitors of transistors have been limiting the tuning range of voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) at these frequencies. To overcome these challenges, harmonic VCOs using high harmonic numbers and switched-capacitor banks at much lower fundamental frequencies were reported [1]. The drawback to this approach is the limited output power since the extracted harmonic number is typically high. Other tuning techniques such as phase/delay control between coupled oscillators and tuning boosting using transformer-based resonators were also reported [2-4]. However, the highest reported tuning range for VCOs above 150GHz is not more than 12.5%, which covers a small portion of the bandwidth available at high mm-Wave and THz frequencies."

       "abstract": "Ring-VCOs (RVCOs) [1] have been avoided for over a decade for high-performance RF systems due to their much lower FOM (<;165dB [2]) than that of their LC counterparts from low to high frequency offsets. Yet, as the cost of ultra-scaled CMOS technologies is escalating, the small-die-area and wide-tuning-range advantages of RVCOs have attracted more attention recently, aiming to break the FOM limit at the system level. In [2], a type-I PLL succeeds in suppressing the RVCO phase noise (PN) by extending the loop bandwidth to 10MHz (fref/20 → fref/2), facilitating an ultra-compact (0.015mm2) frequency synthesizer for 2.4GHz WLAN. However, the type-I PLL only offers 20dB/dec phase-noise suppression for its RVCO. Thus, despite using large transistors (36/0.28μm), the 1/f3 PN corner (f1/f3) is still high (~4MHz), degrading the overall jitter performance of the PLL. This paper proposes a dual-mode time-interleaved RVCO (TI-RVCO). It offers interesting properties of extending the frequency tuning range and reducing f1/f3 corner (~1MHz → ~100kHz), resulting in a better FOM over a wide range of frequency offsets (10kHz to 1MHz). The achieved f1/f3 noise corner (~90kHz to 150kHz) is comparable to the state-of-the-art LC-VCOs [3, 4]."

       "abstract": "Injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) are widely used to realize low-noise carrier sources, particularly at mm-Waves by leveraging harmonic injection, but only within a narrow locking range (ΔfL) [1]. Substantial effort has been made to improve ΔfL by increasing the injection current through multiport injections in open-loop architectures at the expense of a fair amount of extra power dissipation (Pdiss) [2]. The ΔfL-limitation can also be mitigated by calibrating the free-running frequency (fosc) of the ILO using a mixer-based closed-loop configuration, but at the expense of significant hardware complexity in the multi-frequency feedback control and substantially increased Pdiss [3]. In the closed-loop self-calibration technique presented in this paper, the feedback signal is primarily processed in the digital domain after extracting the envelope signal bearing the frequency difference between the injection source (finj) and fosc in the analog domain, resulting in a compact and power-efficient injection-frequency locked loop (IFLL) tracking the 3rd-harmonic of finj over 26.5-to-29.7GHz (ΔfL: 11.4%) with a 2.4mW Pdiss in the calibration circuits."

       "abstract": "Smart phones and their social apps are key drivers for the growth of the internet and, more generally, of big data infrastructure. The ever-increasing demands placed on this infrastructure, in turn, spurs the insatiable need for data communication bandwidth between chips. In this context, wireline transceivers that push the limits imposed by process technology - in terms of data rate, energy efficiency, and area - are extremely critical. This session introduces 2 ADC-based receivers operating at or beyond 25Gb/s for multi-standard support. It continues with a presentation of a 25Gb/s equalizer for cable-dominated channels with up to 50dB of half-baud loss. Two papers addressing different approaches for high-data-rate, short-reach communication are presented next, including an NRZ/PAM-4 Ethernet ADC-based transceiver and a 56Gb/s per lane NRZ transceiver. Finally, the session concludes with two papers describing critical components for I/O solutions at per-lane rates at or beyond 45Gb/s, including a power-efficient 45Gb/s PAM-4 transmitter and a 64Gb/s NRZ transmitter for CDE-56-VSR/MR applications, the latter implemented in 16nm finFET."

       "abstract": "As CMOS devices continue to scale down in voltage and area, digital-based high-speed serial I/Os [1] become increasingly competitive with analog-based designs [2,3]. In addition to offering the PVT-independent performance of digital functions and superior power and area scaling to future technology nodes, digital-based I/Os can support advanced line modulation techniques that will become necessary as long-reach electrical channel data rates scale to 56Gb/s and beyond. The key enablers of a digital receiver are power and area efficient analog to digital conversion (ADC) and digital channel equalization. This paper describes the design of a 25Gb/s 2-level digital serial line receiver including a ¼-rate 5b flash ADC, an 8-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), an 8-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), and a baud-rate clock and data recovery circuit (CDR). The receiver features a flash ADC, which employs a new power and area efficient slicer design capable of achieving high-precision (~1mV) threshold accuracy with an associated on-chip calibration system. The 32nm SOI CMOS receiver achieves error-free operation with margin on a reflective transmission-line channel with 40dB half-baud loss."

       "abstract": "The amount of data traffic is increasing year by year as the number of data-rich services like cloud services and streaming services are increasing. The number of switch modules between servers should decrease to lower latency, and several servers in each rack should be connected to one switch module with cables in a data centre. Using copper cables to connect racks is attractive in terms of cost minimization. Thin cables, for example 34 AWG copper cables, make maintenance easy. The cable length should be 5-7m to connect between racks, and 34 AWG 7m cable has 48dB loss, including board trace loss, package loss and so on. So far transceivers over 25Gb/s, equalizing 35-40dB channel loss have been proposed [1-4], with which low-loss cables like 26 AWG have been required. We target a 25Gb/s transceiver equalizing over 50dB channel loss, and adopt a sub-mV dynamic DC offset cancelation and a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with a bias-controlled tap slicer. Both improve on the minimum input sensitivity and enable data transmission through a channel with over 50dB loss."

       "abstract": "High-speed signaling using NRZ has approached speeds above 50Gb/s where it is extremely difficult to maintain power efficiency and performance over a wide variety of channels and applications. PAM-4 is emerging as one way to increase throughput in such band-limited channels. Higher modulation formats help to address cost in optical systems by packing more bits/wavelength [1]. Strong momentum in standards to adopt PAM-4 reflects these significant trends in the industry. At the same time, migrating transceiver designs to current technology nodes have narrowed the power gap between traditional Analog and ADC-DSP-DAC-based systems for high-speed applications. These factors make ADC-based receivers a highly desirable choice, as is also the trend in wireless communications."

To achieve better power efficiency than that of existing 25Gb/s/signal designs, a high-speed yet energy-efficient front-end is needed in both the transmitter and receiver. A receiver front-end with baud-rate architecture [1] has been successfully operated at 56Gb/s, but additional components such as eye-monitoring comparators, phase detectors, and clock recovery circuitry as well as a power-efficient transmitter are needed to build a complete transceiver."

       "abstract": "The development of next-generation electrical link technology to support 400Gb/s standards is underway [1-5]. Physical constraints paired to the small area available to dissipate heat, impose limits to the maximum number of serial interfaces and therefore their minimum speed. As such, aggregation of currently available 25Gb/s systems is not an option, and the migration path requires serial interfaces to operate at increased rates. According to CEI-56G and IEEE P802.3bs emerging standards, PAM-4 signaling paired to forward error correction (FEC) schemes is enabling several interconnect applications and low-loss profiles [1]. Since the amplitude of each eye is reduced by a factor of 3, while noise power is only halved, a high transmitter (TX) output amplitude is key to preserve high SNR. However, compared to NRZ, the design of a PAM-4 TX is challenged by tight linearity constraints, required to minimize the amplitude distortion among the 4 levels [1]. In principle, current-mode (CM) drivers can deliver a differential peak-to-peak swing up to 4/3(VDD-VOV), but they struggle to generate high-swing PAM-4 levels with the required linearity. This is confirmed by recently published CM PAM-4 drivers, showing limited output swings even with VDD raised to 1.5V [2-4]. Source-series terminated (SST) drivers naturally feature better linearity and represent a valid alternative, but the maximum differential peak-to-peak swing is bounded to VDD only. In [5], a dual-mode SST driver supporting NRZ/PAM-4 was presented, but without FFE for PAM-4 mode. In this paper, we present a PAM-4 transmitter leveraging a hybrid combination of SST and CM driver. The CM part enhances the output swing by 30% beyond the theoretical limit of a conventional SST implementation, while being calibrated to maintain the desired linearity level. A 5b 4-tap FIR filter, where equalization tuning can be controlled independently from output matching, is also embedded. The transmitter, implemented in 28nm CMOS FDS- I, incorporates a half-rate serializer, duty-cycle correction (DCC), ≫2kV HBM ESD diodes, and delivers a full swing of 1.3Vppd at 45Gb/s while drawing 120mA from a 1V supply. The power efficiency is ~2 times better than those compared in this paper."

In mobile SKUs, the peripheral control hub (PCH) resides in the same package (MCP) as the CPU and communicates through an on-package IO (OPIO) bus. For desktop (DT), the PCH resides on the platform. Fig. 4.1.1 presents the SKL block diagram for the minimum configuration (2 cores, 24 EU GP, MCP). A key challenge was the need to add new capabilities, while reducing power, especially for some of the popular uses (media, casual gaming, speech recognition and advanced imaging)."

The expanding role for car information systems requires higher computational performance, but also safety mechanisms which prevent serious accidents. This paper presents an SoC for the next generation of car infotainment, achieving high performance powered by nine heterogeneous CPUs and a high level of safety, complying with ISO26262 ASIL-B. It has two key features: 1) Run-time test for functional safety, which can detect wear-out faults, such as random fault, time-dependent dielectric breakdown, and electromigration; 2) A killer-droop (critical voltage droop) monitor with droop prediction, which can avoid a delay fault caused by voltage droop."

       "abstract": "Energy-efficient computing and ultra-low-power operation are requirements for many application areas, such as IoT and wearables. While for some applications, integer and fixed-point processor instructions suffice, others (e.g. simultaneous localization and mapping - SLAM, stereo vision, nonlinear regression and classification) require a larger dynamic range, typically obtained using single/double-precision floating point (FP) instructions. Logarithmic number systems (LNS) have been proposed [1,2] as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional FP, as several complex operations such as MUL, DIV, and EXP translate into simpler arithmetic operations in the logarithmic space and can be efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic units. However, ADD and SUB become nonlinear and have to be approximated by look-up tables (LUTs) and interpolation, which is typically implemented in a dedicated LNS unit (LNU) [1,2]. The area of LNUs grows exponentially with the desired precision, and an LNU with accuracy comparable to IEEE single-precision format is larger than a traditional floating-point unit (FPU). However, we show that in multi-core systems optimized for ultra-low-power operation such as the PULP system [3], one LNU can be efficiently shared in a cluster as indicated in Fig. 4.6.1. This arrangement not only reduces the per-core area overhead, but more importantly, allows several costly operations such as FP MUL/DIV to be processed without contention within the integer cores without additional overhead. We show that for typical nonlinear processing tasks, our LNU design can be up to 4.2× more energy efficient than a private-FP design."

       "abstract": "With the rising importance of energy efficiency, zero leakage power and instant-on capability are highly desired features in energy harvesting sensors, as well as “normally off” high performance processors. However, intermittent power in such systems requires nonvolatile memory (NVM) to hold intermediate data and avoid rollbacks. Previous work has adopted FeRAM and STT-MRAM to achieve zero-standby power and fast-restore nonvolatile processors (NVPs) [1-3]. Previous NVPs, however, suffer from several drawbacks: 1) Various power interrupt periods are not considered; 2) the 2-macro memory architecture slows access speed; 3) worst-case store/restore operations are always performed. We present a 65nm fully-CMOS-logic-compatible ReRAM-based NVP achieving time/space-adaptive data retention. A 1-macro nvSRAM with self-write-termination (SWT) is integrated to boost clock frequency and reduce store energy. The adaptive retention and SWT strategy relieve the ReRAM write endurance challenge (106-1012), making it sufficient for most applications. The NVP operates at 100MHz with 20ns/0.45nJ restore time (TRESTORE)/energy (ERESTORE), realizing 6× reduction in TRESTORE, >6000× reduction in ERESTORE and 4× higher clock frequency compared with existing designs."

       "abstract": "Low-offset and low-noise operational amplifiers (OpAmps) are essential for precision measurement systems. Applications such as precision weigh scales, sensor front-ends, bridge transducers, interfaces for thermocouple sensors, and medical instrumentation require amplification of low-level signals with high closed-loop gain and low noise. An OpAmp with high precision and fast response enables more frequent measurement of sensor signals leading to more accurate control. Offset and its temperature drift in a traditional CMOS OpAmp cannot be made less than 100μV/0.5μV/°C even with multi-temperature trimming, with flicker noise corner at 100's of Hz. Reduction of the offset and flicker noise below these limitations can be achieved by chopping (correlated double sampling) of the input signal [1]. Disadvantages of chopping are: increase in OpAmp input current, caused by charge injection through input chopping switches, large ripples and noise at the chopping frequency, and long settling time limited by the chopping frequency. Existing chopper OpAmps show good DC and low-frequency accuracy but cannot combine it with bandwidth higher than 2 to 4MHz or settling time comparable not only to high speed OpAmps, but even OpAmps in the most popular 10MHz market segment [1-3]. This results in low usable bandwidth when the OpAmp is configured in high closed-loop gain configurations, where output error needs to be minimized. The described OpAmp achieves a high unity gain-bandwidth (10MHz), fast large-signal settling (4μs to 0.01%) and low noise at both high and low frequencies (6.5nV/√Hz), while having low input current (<;100pA). This is made possible by a combination of new topology and circuit decisions based on the structural design methodology [4]."

       "abstract": "A high power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and high-linearity Class-D audio amplifier (CDA) becomes important as the CDA is directly connected to a battery supply for efficiency considerations in mobile phone applications. Several closed-loop pulse-width-modulation (PWM) CDAs with high PSRR (>90dB) have been published recently. In conventional PWM fully differential CDAs [1,2], these designs are focused on increasing differential loop gain to improve PSRR. However, the PSRR is mainly limited by feedback gain-matching, that is, resistor matching of the feedback network; hence, it is difficult to achieve PSRR >80dB for yield >99%. In [3], a pseudo-differential structure composed of two single-ended opamps is adopted to achieve PSRR >90dB. Nevertheless, it suffers from 3dB noise increase as compared to the fully differential counterpart. Moreover, unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) of single-ended opamps is usually smaller than that of fully differential opamps due to the design trade-off between noise and the location of current-mirror poles; hence, it results in low in-band gain and high total harmonic distortions (THDs) of pseudo-differential CDAs. As for linearity, conventional PWM CDAs suffer from poor linearity due to in-band aliasing tones. In the uniform PWM (UPWM) architecture [4] that achieves THD+N of around -96.5dB, a sinc function, realized by using a sample-and-hold circuit in front of the loop filter, is applied to avoid the signal-dependent intermodulations folding back in-band. However, high switching frequency is required and the power consumption is increased."

       "abstract": "Modern neuromodulation requires closed-loop functionality, where neural recordings are used to adapt stimulation patterns in real time. A closed-loop system requires the neural sensing front-end to record small neural signals in the presence of large stimulation artifacts. The amplitude of artifacts can be a few 10s of mV, and their power is usually in the same frequency band as the signals of interest, requiring non-traditional adaptive filtering to attenuate the artifacts. This requires a sensing front-end that can handle large signals while maintaining the signal integrity of the accompanying small neural signals. State-of-the-art front-ends saturate beyond an input of ~5mV and have limited linearity, making them incapable of handling large artifacts. This work presents a front-end that can tolerate up to ±20mV artifacts in the signal band of 1Hz to 5kHz. To digitize a 1mV neural signal to 8 bits in the presence of a 20mV artifact, the front-end requires a 12b linearity."

       "abstract": "The target of this work is to develop a low-power 39.25MHz crystal oscillator (XO) with low phase noise for RF applications and to achieve the highest FOM in XO's. To reduce the supply current at a constant negative resistance (RN) in the XO, a stacked-amplifier crystal oscillator (SAXO) operating at I/O voltage is proposed, eliminating the need for a Low-Dropout Regulator (LDO). By stacking 4 amplifiers, the supply current is reduced by 91%. The developed 3.3V, 39.25MHz SAXO with 4-stacked amplifiers in 65nm CMOS consumes 19μW and has a phase noise of -139dBc/Hz at 1kHz offset, thereby achieving a state-of-the-art FOM of 278dB."

       "abstract": "Miniaturized computing platforms typically operate under restricted battery capacity due to their size [1]. Due to low duty cycles in many sensing applications, sleep-mode power can dominate the total energy budget. Wakeup timers are a key always-on component in such sleep modes and must therefore be designed with aggressive power consumption targets (e.g., <;10nW). Also, accurate timing generation is critical for peer-to-peer communication between sensor platforms [1]. Although a 32kHz crystal oscillator can provide low power [2] and accurate long-term stability, the requirement of an off-chip component complicates system integration for small wireless sensor nodes (WSNs)."

       "abstract": "Wireless nodes in Internet-of-Everything (IoE) applications achieve low power consumption by operating the radio at very low duty cycles. The wireless node spends most of its time in sleep, waking only occasionally to transmit or receive data. For some standards, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the data or advertising packet length can be less than the time it takes the crystal oscillator, which is used as the reference clock for the radio's PLL, to turn on. Figure 5.9.1 shows a simplified power profile for a node with a typical BLE advertising packet length. A significant fraction of energy used for each RX/TX burst is used to turn on the oscillator. For applications where average power is not dominated by sleep power, the crystal oscillator start-up time can be a large contributor to average power consumption."

To realize the best possible imaging and sensing performance, there is growing demand for extended dynamic range that can precisely reproduce color tone. Several conventional papers have described methods for enhancing dynamic range, such as multiple exposures in a frame [1] and a lateral overflow integration capacitor [2,3]. However, all these techniques realize a 100-to-200dB dynamic range by synthesizing multiple exposures, with asynchronism between multiple exposures causing time distortion. Thus, a simultaneous-capture wide dynamic range (SCWDR) over 100dB is desired."

Conventional CMOS image sensors (CIS) with GS functions require storage located near the photoelectric conversion area [2-3], and the two-stage transferring pixel structures required to suppress kT/C noise need two storage nodes and extra transistors. This makes it difficult, in GS pixels, to simultaneously shrink the pixel size and enlarge the saturation signal."

This large-format sensor development aims to reduce the data acquisition (flight) time and cost, leading to higher productivity for the end-user. Due to the increased sensor resolution, these new systems allow higher flight altitude for the same ground sampling distance (GSD), thereby covering substantially larger swath width (distance covered across track during flight). Alternatively, at similar altitude, the system will deliver higher ground resolution. The described sensor exceeds the highest pixel count of sensors used for aerial mapping applications reported in a recent survey paper [1]."

       "abstract": "Recently, there has been strong demand for high-resolution CMOS image sensors (large number of pixels) in the fields of security, science, and other specialized areas [1,2]. One of the major issues in realizing high-resolution image sensors is to speed up signal readout. For high-speed signal readout, it is necessary to accelerate pixel readout, AD conversion in column circuits, horizontal data output from column memories, and digital data output from the chip. Single-slope ADCs (SS-ADC) are the most common architecture in commercialized CMOS image sensors; increasing their counting clock frequency up to 2.376GHz [3] and using multiple ramp signals [4] can shorten the AD conversion period. However, the former has difficulty in maintaining the clock quality and suppressing power dissipation due to the high clock frequency, and the latter has difficulty in controlling the uniformity and the quality of the multiple ramp signals. Another significant issue is power consumption. Rise of power consumption with increase in number of columns results in non-uniformity of power supply to the column circuits due to IR drops. It may give rise to degradation of image quality such as fixed pattern noise, etc."

Even though leading-edge image sensors have reached the noise floor of a few electrons [1,2], a thrust towards darker levels still continues down to an illumination level equivalent to being under a crescent moon (i.e., 10-2 down to 10-4 lux). This requires single-photon detection with typical digital cameras pixel size, i.e., 1.5 to 5μm. Although huge-size pixel [3] or single-photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) based image sensors [4] have been presented for such a purpose, in general, both have to pay area and dark current penalties. Thus, an image sensor capable of both single-photon detection and normal imaging providing us with a high dynamic range is a huge technological challenge."

       "abstract": "This paper presents a 1.2e-, 3D-stacked CMOS image sensor (CIS) for mobile applications. A key motivation for using a stacked configuration is to minimize the chip area. Also, since numerous components must be integrated into the bottom chip, a scaled 65nm CMOS process is adopted for the bottom chip. The developed CIS features 1.2e- temporal noise with extremely high power efficiency by employing a multiple-sampling (MS) technique. A 2nd-order incremental ΔΣ ADC with inverter-based switched-capacitor integrator realizes the MS technique with low power [1]. However, an exponential number of samples are required to reduce the quantization noise, and conversion speed worsens with higher bit resolution. An extended counting ADC, which is a blend of folding integration and cyclic ADC, attains high resolution with reduced conversion time [2-3]. However, an op-amp with high open-loop gain is required for good linearity and column-to-column matching characteristics, which increases power consumption. Also it is not suitable for scaled CMOS technology. An alternative approach is a single-slope (SS) based MS technique [4], in which two SS-ADCs convert the same pixel signal, and the readout signal is averaged in the digital domain, but the noise improvement is limited to -3dB and the power consumption and area occupation are roughly doubled."

       "abstract": "3D stacking and computational imaging are two major driving forces for CMOS image sensors. In addition, 3D stacking separates pixel array and peripheral circuits. As such, computational imaging blocks (stereo vision, array camera, reconfigurable instruction cell array, etc.) can integrate with sensor circuits while leveraging advanced CMOS technologies including FinFET. To accommodate this trend, we need to design blocks such as comparators, readouts, transmitters, and PLLs, using digital architectures in logic processes with a minimum number of resistors and capacitors. Achieving 100% array-to-chip area ratio is an ultimate goal of 3D CIS. For this reason, all peripheral circuits must be under the pixel array. However, row and column circuits may overlap at the corner if both pitches are equal to pixel pitch. To avoid this issue, we make row and pixel pitch the same, and shrink column pitch to 82% to spread the column signal to array width using the “river routing” tools introduced for display-driver ICs, as shown in Fig. 6.8.1. The 3D stacking technology we apply [1] is top-metal face-to-face, and it can put 3D connections under a backside-illuminated pixel array. Therefore it increases array-to-chip area ratio comparing with a TSV chip that uses area outside the pixel array. This chip demonstrates the 3D connections at the center of the uniform 33Mpixel array and seamless image readout using 4 identical 8.3Mpixel circuit units. Instead of developing new circuitry, we can combine 16 compact units for 133Mpixel at the same frame rate and save the extra driving power."

A 33Mpixel 120fps CMOS image sensor with a 12b column-parallel analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is reported in [1]. In addition to standard operation, higher sensitivity, smaller pixels, and a higher frame rate of 240fps or more are required for CMOS image sensors. Backside-illuminated stacked CMOS image sensors [2] are effective for simultaneously achieving both high sensitivity for small pixels and high operation speed. However, these stacked structures are still insufficient for high-frame-rate UHDTV image sensors since the pixel wafer and the ASIC wafer are connected by through-silicon vias in the peripheral area."

       "abstract": "Today's explosive demand for data transfer is accelerating the development of non-volatile memory with even larger capacity and cheaper cost. Since the introduction of 3D technology in 2014 [1], V-NAND is believed to be a successful alternative to planar NAND and is quickly displacing planar NAND in the SSD market, due to its performance, reliability, and cost competitiveness. V-NAND has also eliminated the cell-to-cell interference problem by forming an atomic layer for charge trapping [2], which enables further technology scaling. However, the etching technology required for creating a channel hole cannot keep up with the market-driven WL stack requirement. Therefore, total mold height reduction is unavoidable and this creates several problems. 1) reduced mold height increases resistance and capacitance for WLs due to the thinner layers being used. 2) channel hole critical dimension (CD) variation becomes problematic because the additional mold stack height aggravates uniformity, thereby producing WL resistance variation. Consequently, read and program performance degradation is inevitable, furthermore their optimization becomes more challenging."

       "abstract": "Two performance gaps in the memory hierarchy, between CPU cache and main memory, and main memory and mass storage, will become increasingly severe bottlenecks for computing-system performance. Although it is necessary to increase memory capacity to fill these gaps, power also increases when conventional volatile memories are used. A new nonvolatile memory for this purpose has been anticipated. Storage class memory is used to fill the second gap. Many candidates exist: ReRAM, PRAM, and 3D-cross point type with resistive change RAM. However, nonvolatile last level cache (LLC) is used to fill the first gap. Advanced STT-MRAM has achieved sub-4ns read and write accesses with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (p-MTJ) [1-2]. Furthermore, mature integration processes have been developed and 8Mb STT-MRAM with sub-5ns operation has shown high reliability [3]. Moreover, because of its non-volatility, STT-MRAM can reduce operation energy by more than 81% compared to SRAM for cache [1]. This paper presents STT-MRAM-based last level cache memory (LLC) including MRAM memory core, peripherals and cache logic circuits, using novel power optimization with high-speed power gating (HS-PG),considering processor architectures and cache memory accesses. The STT-MRAM-based cache has high reliability to reduce the write-error rate with novel write-verify-write. Furthermore, a read-modify-write scheme is implemented to reduce active power without penalty. Figure 7.2.1 presents a block diagram of a 4Mb STT-MRAM based cache."

       "abstract": "The large performance gap between traditional storage and the rest of the memory hierarchy calls for a storage class memory (SCM) to fill the need. Phase change memory (PCM) is an emerging memory candidate for SCM with the advantages of scalability, bit-alterability, non-volatility, and high program speed. Previous publications demonstrated high-density single-level-cell (SLC) PCMs using circuits and architectural techniques for expanding memory capacity, increasing bandwidth, and enabling embedded applications [1-4]. For PCM to be a true contender, a multi-level-cell (MLC) topology with at least a moderate data retention time is required. However, the resistance-drift (R-drift) effect causes cell resistance (RCELL) to increase with time, exceeding the ECC correction ability within hours of being programmed. Conventional R-drift mitigation approaches using reference-cell-based resistance tracking (RCRT) [5] and DRAM-like refresh (DR) [6] are feasible, but at the cost of compromising distinguished PCM traits: random write, low latency, and low power. This paper proposes a resistance drift compensation (RDC) scheme to mitigate against R-drift without such compromises, while minimizing the speed and power consumption penalties. The MLC-PCM fixed-threshold retention (FTR) raw-bit-error-rate (RBER) has been suppressed by over two orders of magnitude, reducing it below practical ECC capability limits."

       "abstract": "Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is used in search engines for network and big-data processing [1]-[6]. Nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM) was developed to reduce cell area (A), search energy (ES), and standby power beyond what can be achieved using SRAM-based TCAM (sTCAM) [1]-[2]: particularly in applications with long idle times and frequent-search-few-write operations. nvTCAMs were previously designed using diode-4T2R (D4T2R) with STT-MTJ [3], 2T2R with phase-change memory [4], 4T2R and 3T1R with ReRAM [5,6]. However, these NV devices suffer from the following issues: 1) High ES requirements due to cell-DC-current (IDC-CELL) as well as large match-line (ML) parasitic load (CML), particularly when word-length (WDL) is long; 2) Large A due to the use of two NVM (2R) devices [3]-[5] or in-cell control logic [6]; 3) Limited WDL caused by small ML current-ratio (IML-ratio ≅ IML-MIS/N*IML-M) between mismatch current (IML-MIS) and the leakage-current (IML-M) from cells on a ML, particularly when NVM resistance (R)-ratio (=RHRS /RLRS) between high-R (HRS, RHRS) and low-R (LRS, RLRS) states is small due to process variation; 4) Long search delays (TSD) due to large CML and small IML-ratio. This work proposes 1) a 2.5T1R cell to reduce A, CML, and ES as well as increase IML-ratio; and 2) a region-splitter (RS) sense amplifier (SA) to achieve robust sensing with a smaller ML-Voltage (VML) swing (VMLS) to reduce TSD and ES."

This paper presents a 128Gb multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash memory with a 150 cells/string structure in 14nm CMOS that can be used as a cost-effective storage device. This paper also introduces several approaches to compensate for reliability and performance degradations caused by the 14nm transistors and the 150 cells/string structure. A technique was developed to suppress the background pattern dependency (BPD) by applying a low voltage to upper word lines (WLs) - the drain side(SSL side) WLs with respect to the location of the selected WL - during the verify sequence. Two techniques are also used to improve the program performance: equilibrium pulse scheme and smart start bias control scheme (SBC) in the MSB page. In addition, the first cycle recovery (FCR) of read enable (RE) and the bi-directional data strobe (DQS) is used to achieve a high speed I/O rate. As a result, a 640μs program time and a 800MB/s I/O rate is achieved."

       "abstract": "The computerization of automotive control has expanded the application range of micro controller units (MCUs). A high-end engine-control unit (ECU) requires high-performance Flash MCUs, which integrate high-speed CMOS logic and large high-performance embedded Flash memories (eFlash) [1,2]. There are also broad markets for motor control MCUs: used to control actuators in parts such as seats, windows, and mirrors. In order to integrate analog circuits to control the high voltage (HV) drivers in these parts, those MCUs have been manufactured in Flashless process, and external EEPROM chips are being used. EEPROM chips work as “learning memories” which store the calibration data to optimize analog circuit performance in the field. Replacement of external EEPROM chips by eFlash, resulting in less additional process cost and higher rewrite endurance, is a requirement for more elaborate learning at a higher data sampling rate. In addition to automotive grade reliability under extremely harsh temperature conditions, low power consumption is also a strong requirement as the number of MCUs used in motor control systems is increasing."

       "abstract": "Modern SoC designs employ a number of power domains, many of which are often implemented by low-drop-out (LDO) regulators. The key overhead of the existing LDO design is the large off-chip output capacitor (Cout) for compensating a large/fast change in load current (ILOAD). Miniaturizing and thus integrating COUT on a chip is highly desirable and theoretically possible by shortening the control loop latency. This can be achieved by employing a higher sampling frequency (FCLK) in a synchronous time-driven digital LDO [1] and a high-speed amplifier in an analog LDO [2]. However, large power consumption and the resulting low current efficiency are often inevitable. In this work, we aim to break this trade-off between passive size and efficiency by introducing an event-driven (ED) control scheme. We design the level-crossing event detector and the ED PI controller for short latency. The power dissipation is kept small since no event occurs in the steady state. We prototype a 400μA class LDO with typical VIN=0.5V and VOUT=0.45V in 65nm, achieving a small voltage droop (VDROOP) of 40mV (<;9% of set-point voltage [VSP] of 450mV) with an on-chip integrated COUT of 0.4nF and the peak current efficiency of 96.3%."

       "abstract": "A modern mobile application processor (AP) requires a variety of power voltage levels, which increases the number of external capacitors around the mobile AP. This is because the supply PCB routes from the power management IC (PMIC) to the AP have parasitic inductors. The parasitic inductors introduce ripples on power voltage lines. Therefore, external capacitors are required on the PCB routes between the PMIC and the mobile AP. To reduce the number of external capacitors, one power voltage level from the PMIC is converted into a variety of power voltage levels inside the mobile AP. This both reduces external capacitors as well as the number of power pins on the mobile AP and simplifies PCB routes. For such reasons, integrated low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are preferred in mobile APs."

In a conventional design, a conservative voltage guard band (VGB) is added to the nominal supply of each die to guarantee its correct operation at target frequency in the presence of worst-case delay degradation induced by inverse-temperature dependency (ITD) [3], device aging, and voltage droop. This VGB is determined from post-silicon characterization as the voltage shift needed by the worst-case die, assuming extreme aging usage conditions, while running a power virus load. In this paper, we present a graphics execution core that uses an in-situ tunable replica circuit (TRC) [4-5] to monitor critical timing margin and trigger adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) as needed to dynamically adjust VCC during run time (Fig. 8.4.1). The TRC monitors slow variations in temperature and aging and provides a time-to-digital converter (TDC) code, representing the timing margin measurement, to the AVS controller. Based on the TDC code, the AVS controller communicates a new voltage ID (VID) to the external voltage regulator module (VRM) to maintain minimum VCC necessary to meet a given performance level."

       "abstract": "As Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems proliferate, there is a greater demand for small and efficient power management units. Fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters are promising candidates due to their small form factor and low quiescent power, aided by dynamic activity scaling [1-3]. However, they offer a limited number of conversion ratios, making them challenging to use in actual systems since they often require multiple output voltages (to reduce power consumption) and use various input power sources (to maximize flexibility). In addition, maintaining both high efficiency and fast load response is difficult at low output current levels, which is critical for IoT devices as they often target low standby power to preserve battery charge. This paper presents a fully integrated power management system that converts an input voltage within a 0.9-to-4V range to 3 fixed output voltages: 0.6V, 1.2V, and 3.3V. A 7-stage binary-reconfigurable DC-DC converter [1-2] enables the wide input voltage range. Three-way dynamic frequency control maintains converter operation at near-optimum conversion efficiency under widely varying load conditions from 5nW to 500μW. A proposed load-proportional bias scheme helps maintain high efficiency at low output power, fast response time at high output power and retains stability across the entire operating range. Analog drop detectors improve load response time even at low output power, allowing the converter to avoid the need for external sleep/wakeup control signals. Within a range of 1-to-4V input voltage and 20nW-500μW output power, the converter shows >60% conversion efficiency, while maintaining responsiveness to a 100× sudden current increase."

       "abstract": "Signaling over chip-scale global interconnect is consuming a larger fraction of total power in large processor chips, as processes continue to shrink. Solving this growing crisis requires simple, low-energy and area-efficient signaling for high-bandwidth data buses. This paper describes a balanced charge-recycling bus (BCRB) that achieves quadratic power savings, relative to signaling with full-swing CMOS repeaters. The scheme stacks two CMOS repeated wire links, one operating in the Vtop domain, between Vdd and Vmid=Vdd/2, the other, Vbot, between Vmid and GND. Unlike previous work [1], we require no voltage regulator to maintain the Vmid voltage at Vdd/2, to compensate for differences in data activity in Vtop and Vbot domains. The BCRB also uses simple single-ended signaling, to achieve higher bandwidth per unit bus width than differential buses [2] and lower signaling energy than precharging schemes [3], since we take full advantage of low switching activity and bus-invert coding."

       "abstract": "Physically unclonable function (PUF) circuits are for generating unique secure keys or chip IDs based on intrinsic properties of each chip itself [1-2]. PUFs are a step forward to improve the security level compared to traditional NVM (non-volatile memory) solutions (FUSEs, EEPROM/FLASH, etc.) because they resolve security issues, such as active data-probing, transferring the security key from outside, etc. Since the MOSFET mismatch (e.g. size, doping concentration, mobility and oxide thickness) due to process variations cannot be fully controlled, PUFs, which are based on such phenomena, cannot be replicated. Unfortunately, the PUF output is erroneous by nature, as caused by thermal noise, voltage/temperature influence, aging effects, etc. The stability issue must be overcome since standard security applications, such as data encryption and digital signatures, have zero error-tolerance. In this work, a PUF structure based on the threshold voltage (Vth) difference of inverting logic gates is presented, which is implemented for secure 24b key generation in a 45nm smart card chip. The key is used as part of an encryption key and achieves an error rate as low as 2.01×10-38. The PUF system is also scalable for a larger key size."

       "abstract": "It is well known that technology scaling has led to increasing process/voltage/temperature/aging margins that substantially degrade performance and power in modern processors and SoCs. One approach to address these large timing margins is the use of specialized registers on critical paths that perform error detection and correction (EDAC) [1-5]. While promising, the previously proposed implementations have been limited in several ways. Most notably, they often incur large overheads beyond conventional register designs (e.g., 8-to-44 additional transistors per register). This becomes an obstacle for commercial designs and, hence, there have been no reported implementations of EDAC approaches within substantial commercial processors. Finally, the performance gain from EDAC approaches has not been thoroughly quantified in relation to competing, lower overhead approaches such as frequency binning and canary circuits/critical path monitors [6]."

       "abstract": "To meet the demands of ever-increasing data throughput, carrier aggregation (CA) across frequency bands is becoming necessary. Different regional spectrum allocations lead to a large number of band combinations and challenge the antenna interface performance for inter-band CA. A dedicated antenna for each carrier severely increases the form factor of the device. Splitting the antenna signal with filter banks becomes very complex and costly due to the large number of band combinations. Existing wideband receiver architectures like FTNC [1] have excellent noise figure (NF) but cannot easily handle CA while current inter-band CA receivers [2,3] use separate antennas. We present a frequency-translational quadrature-hybrid (FTQH) receiver architecture that allows RF signal sharing between receivers; FTQH receivers can further be daisy-chained to share a single antenna among multiple receivers while maintaining excellent RF impedance matching and low NF."

Digital-intensive SoCs have been relying on Moore's law to keep the cost down. However, traditional RF and analog circuits are facing more difficulties to keep up with Moore's law due to the physical constraint of inductors, capacitors, and resistors. To overcome these difficulties, we leveraged digital and mixed-signal techniques to architect the transceiver, with a WLAN Digital PA (DPA), a WLAN All-Digital PLL (ADPLL), a BT ADPLL with pulling cancellation, and a high-speed SAR-ADC with reduced analog filter order in the WLAN RX."

       "abstract": "Digital transmitters (DTX) have gained interest in the past few years because of their potential to provide compact die area, better efficiency due to the switching nature of the power amplifier core, and scaling with CMOS technology [1-3]. Quadrature DTX architecture [1] is favored over polar [3] or outphasing [4] for wideband applications, such as WiFi, because of its ability to scale easily to higher signal bandwidth. Moreover, there is no need for a CORDIC block to convert I/Q signals to amplitude/phase signals [3], which results in large-signal bandwidth expansion, nor the need for very precise alignment [3,4] using fast digital circuits and excessive calibrations. However, the promised potential of quadrature DTX technology fell short of what has been expected because of the excessive parasitics at the TX output as a result of the traditional way of combining the two I and Q paths at the PA output [1]. An I/Q power-cell sharing method by time-division multiplexing between local oscillator (LO) I/Q signals has been proposed for a low-band cellular DPA (800MHz) to address this problem [2]. However, the technique requires 25% LO, which is very difficult to realize for the 5.5GHz WiFi band and is very power hungry. The DTX in Fig. 9.5.1 addresses this issue through a different method of I and Q combining as well as a new digital baseband signal mapping for a compact die area, low parasitics at the PA output, lower loading on LO lines and better overall efficiency."

However, the original design in [1] is analog and limited to integer-N (int-N) operation. It is desirable to extend it to more versatile fractional-N (frac-N) mode, and to make it digital for greater flexibility and more advanced digital calibration.

The quality of the phase-modulated signal, typically expressed in terms of error-vector magnitude (EVM), still remains limited by the PLL phase-noise, gain mismatch between the two injection paths and linearity of the digital-to-modulated phase conversion. We present a phase modulator that makes use of an analog, fractional-N, digital-to-time-converter (DTC)-based subsampling PLL that achieves -37.4dB EVM around a 10.24GHz fractional carrier during 10Mb/s GMSK modulation. The subsampling PLL architecture uses no power-consuming divider and allows wide PLL bandwidth (because of its high phase-error detection gain) for optimal VCO noise suppression. The VCO has a secondary, digitally controlled capacitor bank (modulating DAC) used during two-point modulation. The gain errors and nonlinearities in the digital-to-modulated phase conversion are automatically background-calibrated in both injection points: in the phase-error detection path (where nonlinearity is dominated by the DTC INL) and in the VCO modulating capacitor bank (where nonlinearity is dominated by capacitor mismatch and nonlinear capacitance-to-frequency conversion)."

The fundamental challenge with FD is the tremendous amount of TX self-interference (SI) at the RX. Low-power applications relax FD system requirements [1], but an FD system with -6dBm transmit power, 10MHz signal bandwidth and 12dB NF budget still requires 86dB of SI suppression to reach the -92dBm noise floor. Recent research has focused on techniques for integrated self-interference cancellation (SIC) in FD receivers [1-3]. Open challenges include achieving the challenging levels of SIC through multi-domain cancellation, and low-loss shared-antenna (ANT) interfaces with high TX-to-RX isolation. Sharedantenna interfaces enable compact form factor, translate easily to MIMO, and ease system design through channel reciprocity."

       "abstract": "The era of Internet of Everything and Big Data drives a never-ending evolution of high-speed interfaces towards ever-higher levels of performance. Beyond the need for speed and energy efficiency, the growing variety of deployments, such as in mobile devices and in automobiles, pose new challenges to the wireline transceiver and PLL/CDR designs, including improving immunity to noise and interference and responding quickly to user commands. This session hosts a series of transceiver and clocking techniques to address these emerging challenges. The session's first two papers present coding and modulation techniques for improving the resiliency of memory channels to noise and reflection, respectively. The third paper presents clamping and filtering circuits for tolerating over-voltage stress and suppressing EMI emissions for emerging automotive interconnect applications. The session's last five papers present advances in clock synthesis, including a new spur cancellation approach, injection-locked oscillators that can instantly turn on and off with the ability to continuously compensate PVT variations and frequency drifts, and the demonstration of an LC-oscillator-based PLL with a wide, seamless tuning range."

       "abstract": "High-speed signaling over package substrates is key to delivering the promise of 2.5D integration. Applications abound and include high-density memory interfaces, sub-division of large dies to increase yield and lower development time, sub-division of a die to achieve upward or downward scalability, or connecting to an off-chip SerDes or optics engine. Each of these in-package applications typically has high throughput and onerously low power constraints along with a low-loss channel. Several solutions have been proposed. Interposer substrates [1], or Chip-on-Substrate-on-Wafer [2] allow for very high-density wiring and low power using CMOS transceivers. Their high manufacturing and testing cost makes them prohibitive for anything but high-end applications. A different approach using high-speed ground-referenced single-ended signaling is reported in [3], which is intended for shorter channels up to 4.5mm and a BER of 1e-12. An approach using differential signaling on up to 0.75\" of Megtron 6 material and a BER of 1e-9 is reported in [4]. A comparison is given in Fig. 10.1.1."

       "abstract": "The continuous scaling of CMOS technology increases processor performance and memory capacity, requiring the CPU/Memory interface to have ever-higher bandwidth and energy efficiency over the past few years. Among those cutting-edge interface technologies, multi-band (multi-tone) signaling has shown great potential because of its high data-rate capability along with its low energy consumption [3]-[5]. With spectrally divided signaling, the multi-band transceiver can be designed to avoid spectral notches with extended communication bandwidth of multi-drop buses [4]. Also, its unique self-equalized double-sideband signaling renders the multi-band transceiver immune to inter-symbol interference caused by channel attenuation without additional equalization circuitry [5]. To further improve the capability and validate the scalability of multi-band signaling, we have realized a tri-band transceiver with four parallel lanes and achieved a total data rate of 40Gb/s, with total power consumption of 38mW in 28nm CMOS technology."

       "abstract": "Ethernet over a single unshielded twisted pair (UTP) copper cable coupled with power over data lines (PoDL) is gaining momentum for automotive networking, as evidenced by the recent adoption of BroadR-Reach as the IEEE802.3bw (100BASE-T1) standard and the drafting of the IEEE802.3bp (1000BASE-T1) and IEEE802.3bu (PoDL) standards [1]. BroadR-Reach has won out for its superb electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) performance - a major challenge for adapting Ethernet to automotive environments [2]. Ethernet over plastic optical fiber, as specified by IEEE802.3bv [1], appears to be an EMC solution, but a separate medium is required to deliver power to networked sensors (such as cameras). Shielded pairs are not a good choice either, due to weight/size constraints and reliability concerns about shield grounding.

       "abstract": "The consumer electronics market demands high-speed and low-power serial data interfaces. The injection locked oscillator (ILO) based clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit [1-2], is a well-known solution for these demands. The typical solution has at least two oscillators: a master and one or more slaves. The master, a replica of the data path ILO, is part of a phase locked loop (PLL) used to correct the oscillator free-running frequency (FRF). The slave ILO phase locks to the incoming data but uses the frequency control from the master. Any FRF difference between the master and slave, such as that caused by PVT or mismatch, reduces the receiver performance. One solution to the reduced performance [3] uses burst data and corrects the FRF between bursts. However, for continuous data, injection forces the recovered clock frequency to match the incoming data rate, masking any FRF error from the frequency detector. Existing solutions [4-5] use a phase detector (PD) to measure the FRF. However, any static phase offset between the PD lock point and the ILO lock point causes the frequency control algorithm to converge incorrectly. Static phase offset can be caused by mismatch, PVT, or layout. This paper describes an ILO-type CDR, called the frequency-capturing ILO (FCILO), that eliminates the master oscillator and combines the ILO and PLL [6] type CDRs, realizing the benefit of both. The ILO gives wide bandwidth and fast locking while the PLL gives wide frequency capture range. The CDR architecture, shown in Fig 10.4.2, has a half-rate ILO, data and edge samplers making a bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), two 2:10 demuxes, and independent digital phase and frequency control. The ILO is made from current-starved inverters and driven by an edge detector. The ILO has coarse and fine frequency tuning. The strength of the unit inverter of the oscillator is adjusted for coarse tuning, keeping the normalized gain and delay constant over a wide range of frequencies. A current DAC i- used for fine tuning. The edge detector shorts the ILO differential nodes together to align clock and data transitions. The BBPD outputs are used by the digital phase and frequency control to determine if ILO edges are early or late with respect to the incoming data and to correct the ILO FRF. A variable delay circuit controls the timing between data and clock inputs to the BBPD, correcting the static phase offset between the PD and ILO lock points."

       "abstract": "A low-spur PLL is desirable for many applications since it avoides mixing unwanted blocker signals, prevents emission mask violations or minimizes jitter in the clock source. Internal spurs result from the nature of PLL operation and include reference spurs and fractional spurs when the PLL is operated in fractional-N mode. External spurs are caused by nearby disturbances, such as coupling from other clock domains in an SoC design. To achieve ultra-low spur levels, this work proposes a feedforward multi-tone spur cancellation loop for a fractional-N digital PLL architecture. The proposed scheme aims to cancel: a) fractional spurs caused by finite time-to-digital converter (TDC) quantization steps and its DNL when operated in fractional-N mode; b) external spurious tones that are in a harmonic relationship, and c) independent series of spurious tones that are not in a mutually harmonic relationship by cascading cancellation loops. A proof-of-concept 3-to-5GHz digital PLL prototype is implemented in 65nm CMOS and achieves a worst-case reference spur of -110.1dB and a worst-case in-band fractional spur of -73.66dB, both of which are lower than the reported spur level among state-of-the-art PLLs [1-4]. The internal or external spur magnitude reduction after enabling the cancellation loop ranges from 15 to 50dB over different operation scenarios; this reduction validates the effectiveness of the proposed spur cancellation scheme."

       "abstract": "Injection-locked clock multipliers (ILCMs) achieve superior phase noise compared to conventional PLLs [1, 2]. In its simplest form, an ILCM is an oscillator into which a train of narrow pulses is injected at reference frequency FREF as shown in Fig. 10.6.1. If the free-running frequency, FFR, of the oscillator is tuned close to NFREF (N=4, in Fig. 10.6.1), injected pulses phase lock the oscillator and greatly suppress its close-in phase noise. However, any deviation of FFR from NFREF degrades spurious/jitter performance, making ILCM performance sensitive to PVT variations. A frequency-tracking loop (FTL) was used to continuously tune FFR to be close to NFREF and achieve excellent jitter performance (<;200fsrms) in a power and area efficient manner, independent of PVT variations [1, 2]. However, ILCMs have been fundamentally limited to only integer-N operation and cannot be used for fractional-N frequency synthesis. To understand this limitation, consider the ILCM waveforms shown in Fig. 10.6.1 when FFR is initially tuned to the desired fractional frequency of (N+α)FREF (N=4 and α=0.25 in the example). Because injection takes place only on the positive edge of reference clock, phase difference between injection pulse and the oscillator output, ΔΦE, grows rapidly at a rate of 0.25TOSC/TREF. As a consequence, the oscillator cannot be injection locked and it operates in open-loop mode with poor phase noise/frequency stability. In [3], a coarse fractional-N operation is achieved by rotating the injection across ring oscillator delay stages, but the jitter performance is limited (>4psrms) due to mismatch between delay stages. In this work, we seek to overcome this fundamental limitation of conventional ILCMs and extend their benefits to fractional-N ILCMs."

       "abstract": "An injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) is considered to be a promising solution that can generate low-jitter, high-frequency clocks, using a limited budget in terms of silicon area and power consumption. However, an ILCM has a critical problem in that its jitter performance is sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Thus, in general, an ILCM must be equipped with a dedicated PVT-calibrator to mitigate the sensitivity of its performance to PVT variations. One of the most general calibration methods is to use a phase-locked loop (PLL). This method can correct static frequency deviations of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) due to process variations, but it cannot prevent real-time frequency drifts due to temperature or voltage variations [1]. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop new PVT-calibrators, capable of continuous frequency tracking [1-6]. In [1-3], frequency drifts were monitored by a replica-VCO or a delay-locked loop (DLL) that used the same delay cells as the main VCO. However, in these architectures, each calibrator must spend the same amount of the power as the VCO. In addition, mismatches between delay cells limit the calibrating precision or demand an additional calibrating step. References [4-6] presented frequency-tracking loops (FTLs) based on various methods to detect the phase shifts of VCO outputs when reference-pulses are injected. Reference [4] used a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to detect the phase shifts, but it had large power consumption and silicon area due to the many digital circuits. Although the FTL of [5] used a timing-adjusted phase detector (PD), it could suffer from large in-band noise or spurs since the switches of the charge pump (CP) must be on for a considerable duration in every period. In [6], a pulse-gating technique that periodically skipped the injection was presented, but it could generate fractional spurs."

       "abstract": "High-performance, flexible clock synthesis is a key challenge in multiple applications, from high-data-rate I/O to reconfigurable radio and radar. Conventional wireline and wireless LC-VCO based PLLs can cover a large tuning range using multiple frequency bands [1, 2], typically using a calibration loop to select an operating band for the VCO, then allowing the PLL to lock within that band. In effect, the in-band frequency tuning range of a typical high-performance LC-VCO covers a small fraction of the total range, the remainder of which is covered using switched high-Q fixed capacitors. This approach has been favored first due to the typically inferior quality factor of analog varactors as compared to that of high-Q vertical natural capacitors (VNCs) with CMOS switches, and second due to the unacceptable noise sensitivity of the VCO control node if the tuning range is covered using a single high-gain varactor. This traditional banding strategy leads to a number of practical problems. First, the entire VCO frequency range cannot be traversed while maintaining glitch-free phase lock, as changing bands involves simultaneously switching in and out large capacitors. Further, the per-band tuning range must be wide enough to guarantee that mismatch between digitally switched capacitor banks does not result in holes in the frequency transfer curve of the VCO. Finally, sufficient tuning range to accommodate temperature-and supply variation-induced drift must be present within each selected band, placing stringent demands on adjacent band overlap and on band selection algorithms. While one component of eliminating coarse bands, stitching of tuning controls across discrete varactors, has been demonstrated in [3], the stitching was achieved over only a fraction of the total range of the oscillator."

Previous work has sought to minimize this noise, by using high-resolution TDCs, e.g., the MEMS-thermistor based TDC described in [1]. This paper presents a TDC based on dual-MEMS resonators [2-3] that has no significant impact on oscillator PN. In a 130Hz bandwidth (BW), the sensor achieves a thermal-noise-limited resolution of 40μK, leading to a resolution FOM (Energy/Conversion × Resolution2) of 0.12pJK2, 5× better than the state of the art [4]."

       "abstract": "CMOS Hall sensors are widely used as magnetic sensors due to their linearity and ease of integration [1-3]. Being essentially n-well resistors, their resolution is determined by thermal noise and so decreases with bandwidth (Fig. 11.3.1), limiting their use in wide-band current-sensing applications, such as in switched-mode power supplies, electric motor control and short-circuit detection. In contrast, the differentiating characteristic of pick-up coils means that their resolution actually improves with bandwidth (Fig. 11.3.1). This paper describes a hybrid sensor in standard CMOS that achieves wide bandwidth and good resolution by employing a Hall sensor in a low-frequency (LF) path and a coil in a high-frequency (HF) path. The sensors' outputs are amplified by two transconductance amplifiers (gm,coil and gm,HS) and then combined by a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) (Fig. 11.3.1). The sensor achieves a resolution of 210μTrms in a 3MHz bandwidth; the latter represents an order of magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art CMOS magnetic sensors [1,4]."

       "abstract": "This work presents a thermal diffusivity (TD) sensor realized in nanometer (40nm) CMOS that demonstrates that the performance of such sensors continues to improve with scaling. Without trimming, the sensor achieves ±1.4°C (3σ) inaccuracy from -40 to 125°C, which is a 5× improvement over previous (non-TD) sensors intended for thermal monitoring. This improves to ±0.75°C (3σ) after a single-point trim, a level of accuracy that previously would have required two-point trimming. Furthermore, it operates from supply voltages as low as 0.9V, and occupies only 1650 μm2, making it one of the smallest smart temperature sensors reported to date. These advances are enabled by the use of a phase-calibration scheme and a highly digital phase-domain ΔΣ ADC."

       "abstract": "Timekeeping based on a 32kHz XTAL still remains the most popular, cost effective, low power, accurate solution for low-power portable applications. Simple solutions with overall accuracies of a few 100ppm are based on the combination of a through-hole or SMD XTAL together with an oscillator implemented as part of the application SoC (micro-controller, cell phone). As a single-ppm error represents a deviation of 30s/year (nearly 1 hour/year at 100ppm!), temperature-compensated XTAL or MEMS oscillators (TCXO, TCMO) used for time-keeping applications have received significant research attention over the last decade, driven by further miniaturization, tighter accuracy and lower power consumption needs [1-4]. Combining both resonator and oscillator intimately or even better, in a single package, leads to superior stability, improved robustness and lower consumption by minimizing environmental effects (moisture, temperature gradients) and stray capacitance. Real-time clock (RTC) modules integrating further time, timer, calendar, time stamping and alarm functions have become a key power-management block capable of scheduling precise wake-up at user- or pre-defined intervals so that a more complex, energy-constrained application can be heavily duty-cycled and left mostly hibernating (e.g., wireless sensor node). They are found in a variety of consumer, metering, medical, wearable, automotive, communication, outdoor, safety, and automation applications, and are a key component of the upcoming IoE revolution."

       "abstract": "Touch screens have recently been adopted not only for smartphones but also for tablet PCs and home appliances that have touch-screen panels (TSPs) larger than 10 inches. However, there are many sources of noise that affect touch detection, and some of these noise sources, such as charger noise, significantly affect the capacitance variation needed to detect touch input and lead to inaccurate touch detection [1-2]. For example, as shown in Fig. 11.6.1, common-mode supply noise results in large peak-to-peak noise injection over 10Vpp and deteriorates touch-detection performance. Although rejection of display noise using the differential sensing method [3] has been investigated, sufficient attenuation of the injected noise through a touch object remains a problem. In this paper, we present an analog front-end (AFE) with noise immunity of up to 20Vpp for a large TSP controller. To improve the immunity to the injected noise, the proposed AFE employs the following techniques: a) TX/RX dual modulation, b) differential sensing, c) high-order noise filtering, and d) multiple TX driving frequency support. Further, to cope with various usages and advanced touch-detection modes, the proposed AFE provides a configurable frame rate from 85 to 385Hz."

       "abstract": "In this paper, we present a column driver with load-aware pre-emphasis driving (LPD) as in Fig. 11.7.2. The LPD scheme calibrates the K value to the panel-load resistance and capacitance to minimize the increase in the settling time due to the column-to-column and panel-to-panel RLCL delay variation. In addition, the self K-calibration reduces fabrication cost because no trimming of the K is required during fabrication. Before the column driver starts its data-driving operation, a K-calibrator embedded in every column searches the K corresponding to the panel load RL and CL of each column and adjusts the K of a pre-emphasis voltage generator (PVG). The K-calibration searches for the K value where the voltage buffer supplies a proper amount of charge for the voltage step (VREF2-VREF1) to the panel load capacitance CL during the preemphasis duration TPRE. To measure the amount of charge on CL, the data line is detached from the voltage buffer after TPRE (φDRV = L) so that the charges on the data line are redistributed. After enough time elapses, the nodes on the data line (v1,2,...,N) are stabilized to one voltage, which is compared to the target data voltage (VREF2). When there is an error, the K-calibrator adjusts the K value to make the data line voltage close to the target data voltage V2. For more precise matching between the amount of the injected charge of the K-calibration and a real driving, the data lines can be disconnected a few hundred nanoseconds after TPRE to reflect the charge leaked during the pre-emphasized output vO slewing down to VREF2."

While depth is measured in common lidar architectures using the round-trip delay of a short pulse [3] (so-called “pulsed lidar”) or the phase-delay of an intensity envelope on continuous-wave (CW) light (“amplitude-modulated (AM)-CW lidar”) [4], these architectures require sub-picosecond timing resolution and commensurate with high power dissipation and large area for sub-millimeter depth precision."

       "abstract": "Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters have several advantages over inductive DC-DC converters in that they are easily integrated on-chip and can scale to desired power levels, rendering themselves promising for integrated voltage regulators, especially for small, low-power systems. However, many SC DC-DC converters offer only a few conversion ratios, limiting their use for systems in which either the input or output voltages vary. This is particularly important in wireless systems where battery voltage degrades slowly. [1] proposed a technique to reconfigure cascaded SC converters to achieve arbitrary binary ratios: p/2N, 0<;p<;2N, where N is the number of cascaded stages. This structure was improved in [2] by reversing the cascading order to increase output conductance and in [3] by using a positive feedback approach. However, this design still provides less output conductance than previous works offering only a small fixed number of ratios [4,5]. This paper presents an SC DC-DC converter that can be reconfigured to have any arbitrary rational conversion ratio: p/q, 0<;p<;q≤2N+1. The key idea of the design, which we refer to as a rational DC-DC converter, is to incorporate negative voltage feedback into the cascaded converter stages using negative-generating converter stages (“voltage negators”); this enables reconfiguring of both the numerator p and denominator q of the conversion ratio. With help from the current supply of the voltage negators, output conductance becomes comparable to conventional few-ratio SC DC-DC designs. Hence, the proposed design achieves a resolution higher than previous binary SC converters while maintaining the conversion efficiency of dedicated few-ratio SC converters. Using only 3 cascaded converter stages and 2 voltage negator stages, the rational converter implemented in 0.18μm CMOS offers 79 conversion ratios and achieves >90% efficiency when downconverting from 2V to a 1.1-to-1.86V outp- t voltage range."

       "abstract": "Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters have gained attention based on their ability to offer a low-cost high-efficiency power conversion, and allow a thin and compact module packaging [1]. However, the SC DC-DC converter offers high efficiency only in a limited input/output voltage range, since it is inherently based on a discrete conversion ratio, which is different from an inductor-based DC-DC converter with a continuous conversion ratio. [2,3] proposed implementing multiple conversion ratios with several SC DC-DC units connected in series. However, these lead to a degradation of the efficiency as well as the maximum current capacity, worse for the conversion ratios that have more stages. On the other hand, there is a lack of a step-up and step-down SC topology, which will further expand the input/output voltage range, and enable using different types of power sources (alkaline, lithium-ion battery, etc.), for portable devices. [4] and some commercial products offer both step-up and step-down conversions, but the step-down conversions are limited to a unity conversion ratio. In this paper, we present a step-up/step-down unified topology that covers the input voltage range from 0.85V to 3.6V, and the output voltage range from 0.1V to 1.9V. Moreover, a dual-output topology with a 4-way channel mapping and an on-demand channel sharing control is also proposed, for delivering 2 regulated voltages with good efficiencies and fast transient responses."

       "abstract": "In recent years, significant progress has been made on switched-capacitor DC-DC converters as they enable fully integrated on-chip power management. New converter topologies overcame the fixed input-to-output voltage limitation and achieved high efficiency at high power densities [1-6]. SC converters are attractive to not only mobile handheld devices with small input and output voltages, but also for power conversion in IoE, industrial and automotive applications, etc. Such applications need to be capable of handling widely varying input voltages of more than 10V, which requires a large amount of conversion ratios [1-3]. The goal is to achieve a fine granularity with the least number of flying capacitors. In [1] an SC converter was introduced that achieves these goals at low input voltage VIN ≤ 2.5V. [2] shows good efficiency up to VIN = 8V while its conversion ratio is restricted to ≤1/2 with a limited, non-equidistant number of conversion steps. A particular challenge arises with increasing input voltage as several loss mechanisms like parasitic bottom-plate losses and gate-charge losses of high-voltage transistors become of significant influence. High input voltages require supporting circuits like level shifters, auxiliary supply rails etc., which allocate additional area and add losses [2-5]. The combination of both increasing voltage and conversion ratios (VCR) lowers the efficiency and the achievable output power of SC converters. [3] and [5] use external capacitors to enable higher output power, especially for higher VIN. However, this is contradictory to the goal of a fully integrated power supply."

       "abstract": "Wide input rails (12V to 100V) are common in today's automotive and industrial systems. Miniaturized DC-DC voltage regulators (VRs), which can provide a low-voltage regulated output from a wide input range and deliver a few Watts, are essential in these systems. Wide-input-range integrated VRs, however have difficulty to simultaneously achieve high frequency (HF) operation and high power efficiency. Previous hard-switching (HS) high-input-voltage (HV) buck regulators can only operate at a low frequency of 100s of kHz in order to limit the dominant switching power loss PSW, that occurs at the converter switching node [1,2]. Low-frequency operation however results in using bulky inductors of 100s of μH, significantly increasing the bill-of-material cost and the converter volume. Three-level converters (TLCs) are effective to reduce the required inductance by doubling the frequency at the switching node and allow using lower-voltage-rating power transistors in HV conditions. However, the concern of large PSW in HV conditions would still limit the HS TLC converter to operate in the MHz range. Moreover, the TLC needs the voltage across its flying capacitor to be balanced at half the input voltage; otherwise power transistors could be damaged during operation. In HF HV conditions, the capability of high-speed flying-capacitor self-balancing is even more crucial, but it is not addressed in prior 3-level DC-DC regulators [3,4]. This paper reports a ZVS-based 3-level voltage regulator (TL-VR) to remove PSW in HF and HV conditions, thereby improving the converter power efficiency. A constant-frequency adaptive-on-time (CF-AOT) V2 control is developed to offer the flying-capacitor self-balancing in the MHz range, ensuring reliable regulator operation with a wide input range. A body-diode-based floating ZVS detection is also proposed to provide nanosecond-scale ZVS turn-on delay and thus enable full-ZVS operation in HF low-duty-ratio conditions."

Since the output capacitor current ICo instantly reflects ΔIload, transient response optimization for minimizing ΔVUS and ts with given charging and discharging slopes of inductor current ILo can be achieved by obtaining an accurate ICo and well-controlling the ILo charging time tch and discharging time tdch [1]. However, ICo sensing accuracy is degraded if the output capacitor's impedance ZCo, comprising the capacitance CO, equivalent series resistance RESR and inductance LESL, varies with different output voltage VO, process variation, and/or PCB parasitics, leading to non-minimized ΔVUS and ts. An off-chip capacitor-current-sensor (CCS) calibration technique is reported in [2]; however, LESL is not considered, so the high-frequency information of ΔIload is inaccurately sensed when large and rapid ΔIload occurs. On the other hand, to well-control the tch and tdch of ILo, the transient-optimized feedback circuit reported in [1] minimizes ΔVUS and ts. However, optimization can be achieved only under fixed CO, output inductor LO, input voltage VIN, and VO."

       "abstract": "Lighting flicker, a rapid and repeated change over time in the brightness of light, has long been known to cause illness in humans that ranges from headaches to seizures. Thus, [1] has specified the dimming frequency, fDIM, larger than 3kHz to achieve a no-observable-effect flicker level. State-of-the-art LED drivers employ the SIMO topology with four channels in Fig. 12.7.1, to deliver energy to each LED using the time-multiplexing (TM) control technique [2-4], in which the luminance is controlled by the dimming signals. Two major shortcomings for such approaches are: (1) Sequential dimming signals; and (2) Current cross-regulation (CCR) effects. In [2], the LED drivers with TM control result in only 9b color resolution at the dimming frequency of 1.5kHz, which may cause flicker hazard. Besides, the complete white-red-green-blue (WRGB) sequence needs a total of four switching periods to light up the 4 LEDs separately. On the other hand, due to inherent rising and falling delay of the hysteretic current control (HCC) circuit, tdr and tdf respectively, the CCR effect seriously affects the accuracy of the controller when the inductor current slope is varied. For example, with L=15μH, VIN=20V, VR=2.5V, VG=3.5V, tdr=300ns and tdf=250ns, the SIMO will result in 4% CCR between Iavg,R and Iavg,G when the average LED current is 1A. More specifically, with the same color in the sequence, voltage regulation may be disregarded when regulated constant current through the sensing resistor RSEN is used as a negative feedback control. However, when different colors are in sequence, where VO, =VR, VG, VB, or VW, are different, large voltage cross-regulation (VCR) across the RSEN occurs and so does the CCR. The CCR effects become an open question for enhancing LED current accuracy. For alleviating the CCR effect, the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) has- been applied for TM control in [3]. However, with the limited output current in DCM, low output power resulted and large output capacitors were required to suppress the VCR. In this paper, a single-inductor multiple-floating-output (SIMFO) LED driver with an average-current-correction (ACC) technique is presented. The developed ACC technique is used to alleviate the CCR effect to about 0.5%. The developed LED driver using the floating output topology offers the following salient features: (1) A complete WRGB sequence is operated in only one switching cycle; (2) All LEDs can be dimmed simultaneously and each LED can also be dimmed individually to achieve 24b color resolution at fDIM=3kHz without flicker hazard; and (3) Achieving high output power and power efficiency (96%)."

       "abstract": "High-voltage linear drivers for multiple-string LEDs have been widely used in general lighting due to their low cost, simplicity, low electromagnetic interference (EMI), and high reliability. However, in conventional multiple-string LED drivers, the LED strings are turned on and off sequentially depending on the magnitude of input voltage (VIN) in order to achieve high power factor (PF) and low total harmonic distortion (THD) [1-3]. The turn-on duty cycles of each string in a four-string LED driver are roughly 80, 60, 40 and 20% respectively, given that VLEDs are identical. Due to its low duty cycle operation, the total brightness is reduced and the brightness of each LED string becomes uneven. This problem becomes more noticeable in long bar-type or surface-type lamps when a triac dimmer is applied. This low utilization of LEDs is a major drawback of multi-string LED drivers. One approach to increase turn-on duty cycle uses diodes and capacitors in each LED string to sustain voltage when VIN is not enough [4]. The problem is that it requires large capacitors due to long turn-off time. Another method is to change the parallel/serial connection of LED strings to match the total voltage drop of LEDs to VIN [5]. Due to its high voltage operation, it is very challenging to make an appropriate, low-cost, and simple solution for all VIN ranges. In order to overcome these problems, a floating current mirror (FCM) IC fabricated in an 85V 0.18um BCDMOS process is presented. As long as VIN is higher than the minimum required LED voltage, FCM enables to turn on all LED strings for all VIN ranges not by using large capacitors, but by modifying only the functional aspects of LED connections. In addition, this approach also prevents EMI problems by keeping an appropriate di/dt during commutation."

       "abstract": "Modern SoC designs employed in battery-life-constrained mobile applications feature multiple power domains to dynamically scale power-performance trade-offs in response to application demands. Since each power domain requires a DC-DC converter, and since low-power mobile applications are also typically area-constrained, the employed DC-DC voltage regulators must: 1) be fully integrated, 2) support high efficiency across large dynamic current ranges spanning high-power active modes to low-power sleep modes where the overhead of complex control or multi-phasing is not feasible [1], and 3) support high power density to occupy minimal area overhead. Unfortunately, achieving both high efficiency and power density is difficult: integrated magnetic converters have limited efficiency and do not leverage CMOS scaling, while switched-capacitor (SC) converters suffer from fundamental power density-efficiency trade-offs due to ½C(ΔV)2f-based slow-switching-limit (SSL) losses. While recent work has employed high-density capacitors using ferroelectric or deep-trench technologies to achieve both high efficiency and high power density [2,3], such capacitor technologies are not available in all processes, and SSL losses still restrict the power density-efficiency trade-off, even with further scaling. Stacked-domain (SD) converters attempt to address this trade-off by achieving DC-DC conversion via stacked loads [4]; however, efficiency and density of SD converters approach the performance of the underlying charge-balance DC-DC converter required under load mismatch conditions, limiting the benefits of the SD approach for practical loads."

       "abstract": "To obtain a 20cm-resolution image within a 15m distance using an X-band FMCW radar, an agile chirp frequency synthesizer phase-locked loop (FSPLL) with a wide chirp bandwidth (BW) greater than 750MHz and a short chirp period (Tm) less than 100μs is necessary. Challenges arise as one tries to realize a triangular chirp profile in Fig. 13.1.1 with a fast chirp slope (=BW/Tm) and precise linearity. In particular, many FMCW FSPLLs exhibit increased frequency errors around the turn-around points (TAPs), degrading the effective resolution achievable. For instance, for FSPLLs modulating either the reference or feedback clock frequency [1-3], the finite loop bandwidth of the PLL limits the maximum chirp slope as well as the linearity of the chirp profile. Moreover, many of these PLLs use a multi-modulus frequency divider (FD) and delta-sigma modulation (DSM) [2], which put further constraints on the maximum PLL bandwidth to filter the quantization noise. While a two-point modulation (TPM) scheme can decouple the conflicting requirements on the PLL bandwidth [4-6], the gain or timing mismatch between the two modulation paths and limited resolution of the DSM-based FD can still limit the chirp linearity, especially when one tries to push the chirp slope faster."

Moreover, for mm-Wave access in 5G it will also be necessary to boost peak data-rates far beyond 1Gb/s at hundreds of meters in small cells. Transceiver architectures with beamforming often combine superheterodyne with RF beamforming [1], leading to a high power consumption and a suboptimal RX noise figure due to losses in the beamforming circuitry. In contrast, the 57-to-66GHz TRX IC presented in this paper, whose architecture is depicted in Fig. 13.5.1, uses direct conversion and analog baseband beamforming. Direct-conversion radios are inherently simpler than superheterodyne and do not have to cope with the image frequency, but on the other hand they may suffer from pulling of the PA on the VCO. In this work this is avoided by the non-integer ratio of 2.5 between the operating frequency and the 24GHz PLL that subharmonically injection locks a 60GHz quadrature oscillator (Fig. 13.5.2)."

       "abstract": "It is predicted that the required wireless communication capacity will become 1000 times higher every 10 years. Many wireless standards are under discussion to satisfy the unprecedented capacity requirement. For example, the IEEE802.11ay standard is targeting over 100Gb/s data-rate by using the 60GHz band. Unfortunately, the channel bandwidth of 2.16GHz for the 60GHz band is not wide enough to realize such a high data-rate, so a channel-bonding capability is strongly demanded to extend the data-rate as well as 64-QAM support, achieving 42.24Gb/s. To realize 4-channel bonding operation with 64QAM, fine and wideband I/Q mismatch calibration is one of the remaining issues. In addition, an 8b 14.08GS/s ADC is required to support 42.24Gb/s, which is usually realized by a massive time-interleaved ADC, and needs unreasonably large power consumption. In this work, a frequency-interleaved (FI) architecture is employed for the 60GHz transceiver-side to mitigate the wideband I/Q mismatch issue and the ADC requirement. In addition, an asymmetric quadrature injection-locked oscillator (QILO) is proposed to widen the locking range."

       "abstract": "As in most RF circuits, the design of transmitters for advanced mobile communication systems is dominated by the tradeoff between cost and performance. While the former claims ever-smaller footprints and bill of materials (BOM), the latter comprises a stringent set of requirements regarding power consumption, signal integrity and out-of-band noise emission. Analog-intensive architectures [1,2] typically deliver the best noise performance at the cost of intensive lowpass filtering, hence increasing area consumption with bulky reconstruction filters. The digital transmitters [3-5], on the other hand, are significantly more portable and area efficient, but they typically fall short in terms of out-of-band noise and spurious emission. A charge-based architecture was presented in [6], using incremental signaling in a switched-capacitance architecture to provide intrinsic noise-filtering capabilities with small power and area consumption. This work presents a transmitter architecture that leverages the incremental-charge-based operation by using power-efficient resistive DACs to deliver charge directly to the 50Ω output RF load, omitting the need for a PA driver stage, in a complete digital-intensive architecture. With a peak output power of 3.5dBm, the presented work achieves -159dBc/Hz at 45MHz offset from both 900MHz and 2.4GHz modulated carriers, with an EVM performance of -36dB for a 64-QAM modulated signal."

The robots have enhanced controllers that realize AI functions, such as perception (information extraction) and cognition (decision making). Historically, controllers have been based on general-purpose CPUs, and only recently, a few perception SoCs have been reported. SoCs with cognition capability have not been reported thus far, even though cognition is a key AI function in micro robots for decision making, especially autonomous drones. Path planning and obstacle avoidance require more than 10,000 searches within 50ms for a fast response, but a software implementation running on a Cortex-M3 takes ~5s to make decisions. Micro robots require 10× lower power and 100× faster decision making than conventional robots because of their fast movement in the environment, small form factor, and limited battery capacity. Therefore, an ultra-low-power high-performance artificial-intelligence processor (AIP) is necessary for micro robots to make fast and smart maneuvers in dynamic environments filled with obstacles."

       "abstract": "8K Ultra HD is being promoted as the next-generation digital video format. From a communication channel perspective, the latest high-efficiency video coding standard (H.265/HEVC) greatly enhances the feasibility of 8K by doubling the compression ratio. Implementation of such codecs is a challenge, owing to ultra-high throughput requirements and increased complexity per pixel. The former corresponds to up to 10b/pixel, 7680×4320pixels/frame and 120fps - 80× larger than 1080p HD. The latter comes from the new features of HEVC relative to its predecessor H.264/AVC. The most challenging of them is the enlarged and highly variable-size coding/prediction/transform units (CU/PU/TU), which significantly increase: 1) the requirement for on-chip memory as pipeline buffers, 2) the difficulty in maintianing pipeline utilization, and 3) the complexity of inverse transforms (IT). This paper presents an HEVC decoder chip supporting 8K Ultra HD, featuring a 16pixel/cycle true-variable-block-size system pipeline. The pipeline: 1) saves on-chip memory with a novel block-in-block-out (BIBO) queue system and a parameter delivery network, and 2) allows high design efficiency and utilization of processing components through local synchronization. Key optimizations at the component level are also presented."

       "abstract": "Technology advancement has recently made it attractive to replace the flash quantizer (QTZ) in a multibit ΔΣ modulator by an asynchronous successive-approximation-register (ASAR) QTZ to improve the overall power efficiency [1]. However, limited by the SAR throughput, most works in this regime report only a small signal bandwidth. To achieve a wide bandwidth, a lower oversampling ratio (OSR) can be utilized, which dictates more aggressive noise shaping for a constant SNDR, and thus can potentially compromise the stability of the modulator. A discrete-time (DT) noise-coupling (NC) technique [2] circumvents this problem and is suitable for deployment in an SAR-assisted multibit ΔΣ modulator. In a switched-capacitor SAR, the quantization error (Eq) is naturally produced on the summing node at the end of the SAR bit cycles and can be buffered and injected back into the loop filter (LF) to facilitate NC. In addition, the switched-capacitor SAR DAC also provides a convenient means to incorporate the excess-loop-delay (ELD) compensation in a continuous-time (CT) modulator. To explore these techniques, this paper presents a 10× OSR, 4th-order CT ΔΣ modulator with mixed-mode (DT-CT) 2nd-order NC and ELD compensation, all integrated in a 4b ASAR QTZ."

       "abstract": "The trend towards wideband radio front-ends (RFE) for car radio receivers allows for digital tuning and channel filtering, simultaneous reception of multiple channels and reduced interference. A filter-less RFE requires a high dynamic range and very linear analog-to-digital converter (ADC). For AM/FM, typical total harmonic distortion (THD), intermodulation distortion and spurious tone levels of the ADC must be below -100dBc. These nonlinearity levels are much lower than the required ADC noise that is necessary to maintain high reception quality of a weak wanted signal in the presence of strong unfiltered interferers. Such audio-like linearity performance has been demonstrated for low input signal frequencies up to several hundreds of kHz [1-2], but the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of ADCs with >10MHz bandwidth is typically limited to 80 to 90dB [3-4] due to static mismatches associated with multi-bit quantization and dynamic errors such as data-dependent disturbances on the DAC supply [1]. This paper presents a continuous-time (CT) ΔΣ ADC that achieves -102dB THD, -104dB IM3, >110dB SFDR and 77dB SNDR in 25MHz bandwidth over process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. Such high linearity is achieved by using a 1b feedback DAC, which is highly insensitive to process spread and mismatch, in combination with a wideband high-precision voltage regulator that is designed to mitigate dynamic errors of the 1b DAC."

       "abstract": "ΔΣM performance can be improved by using MASH or SMASH structures to obtain higher-order noise shaping [1]. They have better stability than single-loop structures. The power dissipation of ΔΣMs can be reduced by using simpler amplifiers such as single-stage or inverter-based amplifiers [2]. Selecting a passive or active-passive ΔΣM architecture, where the processing gain of comparator is used in the feedback loop of the ΔΣM's filter [3], allows a reduction in the number of amplifiers and their gain. This solution is very appealing for deep-nanometer CMOS technologies, because a comparator can achieve large gain through positive feedback, which improves with faster transistors. This paper presents a passive-active CT 2-1 MASH ΔΣM using RC integrators, low-gain stages (~20dB) and simplified digital cancellation logic (DCL). The ΔΣM, clocked at 1GHz, achieves DR/SNR/SNDR of 77/76/72.2dB for input signal BW of 10MHz, while dissipating 1.57mW from a 1V supply."

Using large input devices to reduce 1/f noise greatly increases area occupied by the input stage, and degrades linearity due to the increased parasitic capacitance at the OTA virtual ground."

       "abstract": "Continuous-time delta-sigma modulators (CT-DSMs) are well suited for the baseband ADC of an LTE-A receiver. To boost user throughput and increase network capacity, CT-DSMs will need to increase signal bandwidth (BW) while maintaining sufficient dynamic range (DR) and good power efficiency. For example, 5 downlink component carriers are no longer sufficient to meet the ITU requirement for IMT-advanced and up to 32 carriers and 640MHz RF bandwidth are under discussion for 3GPP Release 13. This increased BW drives CT-DSMs to operate at a several-GHz clock rate, but comes at a cost of higher power consumption, even when utilizing advanced nanometer CMOS technologies. Previous >100MHz-BW CT-DSMs required a 4GHz clock rate with oversampling-ratio (OSR) beyond 13× and power exceeding 250mW [1,2]. By contrast, the proposed CT-DSM decreases the OSR to 9× while consuming 40mW to achieve 72dB DR within 160MHz BW."

       "abstract": "Audio codecs for automotive applications and smartphones require up to five stereo channels to achieve effective acoustic noise and echo cancellation, thus demanding ADCs with low power and minimal die area. Zoom-ADCs should be well suited for such applications, since they combine compact and energy-efficient SAR ADCs with low-distortion ΔΣ ADCs to simultaneously achieve high energy efficiency, small die area, and high linearity [1,2]. However, previous implementations were limited to the conversion of quasi-static signals, since the two ADCs were operated sequentially, with a coarse SAR conversion followed by, a much slower, fine ΔΣ conversion. This work describes a zoom-ADC with a 20kHz bandwidth, which achieves 107.5dB DR and 104.4dB SNR while dissipating 1.65mW and occupying 0.16mm2. A comparison with recent state-of-the-art ADCs with similar resolution and bandwidth [3-7] shows that the ADC achieves significantly improved energy and area efficiency. These advances are enabled by the use of concurrent fine and coarse conversions, dynamic error-correction techniques, and an inverter-based OTA."

While small low-cost tagging solutions for supply-chain management exist, security in the face of fault-injection [1] and side-channel attacks [2] remains a concern. Power glitch attacks [3] in particular attempt to leak key-bits by inducing fault conditions during cryptographic operation through the use of over-voltage and under-voltage conditions. This paper presents the design of a secure authentication tag with wireless power and data delivery optimized for compact size and near-field applications. Power-glitch attacks are mitigated through state backup on FeRAM based non-volatile flip-flops (NVDFFs) [4]. The tag uses Keccak [5] (the cryptographic core of SHA3) to update the key before each protocol invocation, limiting side-channel leakage to a single trace per key."

       "abstract": "A robust true random number generator (TRNG), able to assure high quality output at different working conditions, is an attractive solution in secure communication application, because it increases resilience against possible external attacks. Among different TRNGs, quantum RNGs (QRNG) represent a good candidate for such systems, because of their compactness, low cost and performance [1-6]. They typically consist of a source of photons, such as an attenuated LED, coupled to a detector with single photon capability (SPAD). Many works in the literature have used a single detector [1-4] for random bit extraction. These devices are characterized by a limited bit rate [1], which can be increased by exploiting the arrival time of photons at the cost of circuit and system complexity [2-4]. Recent works [5-6] proposed to implement an array of detectors based on SPAD working in parallel thus extending the speed of QRNG up to 5 Gb/s [5]. Despite the high bit rate, the main drawback of [5] is the strong dependence of each pixel bias on the impinging light intensity which forces the system to work only for a narrow range of photon flux that poses several constraints on the design of the final QRNG system, e.g. the need of a feedback control loop to maintain a constant flux of photons, and of a uniform distribution of light over the entire sensor. Moreover, it is impractical to implement algorithms for bit extraction to all detectors of the array because of different responses and mismatches among SPADs."

The recent emergence of low-cost, single-use, flexible, pre-gelled electrode arrays, as in Fig. 16.4.1, delivers significant advantages [1]. Today, these are passive, requiring connection to external readout electronics via a many-channel cable. We present the system in Fig. 16.4.1, having similar flexible form factor, but with the following enhancements: (1) embedded low-noise chopper-stabilized amplifiers using amorphous-silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) compatible with flexible substrates (i.e. low-temperature-processed, <;180°C); (2) compressive-sensing acquisition and multiplexing of >20 EEG channels onto a single interface using TFT scanning circuits, to substantially ease connection with an embedded IC; and (3) an algorithm whereby spectral-energy features, a generic EEG biomarker, are derived directly from the compressed signals (by a conventional CMOS IC). Seizure detection from the extracted features is demonstrated via analog replay of patient EEG through the system."

Our roadmap focuses on thin-film transistor technologies, fabricated directly on plastic film in an industrially upscalable process flow compatible with existing flat panel display (FPD) lines. As a consequence, it is conformal, extreme lightweight and can be placed onto every object. The charge carrier mobility of such transistors is quite low (around 10cm2/Vs), posing big challenges to comply with the different ISO standards set by Si-CMOS-IC."

Automotive electronics operate from the car battery (VIN) which experiences cold-cranks and load dumps that range from 3V to 40V [1]. This requires power converters, supplied by the battery, to withstand the harsh operating conditions. Compounding these challenges is the growing number of electronics in cars, despite fixed volume and thermal budgets. Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs have demonstrated merits in alleviating these challenges, due to smaller input/output capacitance and near-zero reverse recovery current in comparison to silicon FETs. These attributes facilitate highly efficient power conversion due to a ×10 reduction in switching losses, and thus enable high switching frequency (fSW) operation to reduce the PCB footprint and lower cost."

This is evident with the quantized device-width and limited process-knobs of a FinFET technology, which has greatly affected SRAM design [2-4]. Therefore, assist-circuits are more crucial in a FinFET technology to improve VMIN, which in turn adds to the Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) gain of SRAM."

       "abstract": "Demand for higher bandwidth DRAM continues to increase, especially in high-performance computing and graphics applications. However, conventional DRAM devices such as DDR4 DIMM and GDDR5 cannot satisfy these needs since they are bandwidth limited to less than 30GB/s. Also, if multiple GDDR DRAMs are used simultaneously for higher bandwidth, then high power consumption and routing congestion on PCBs become a big concern. In order to overcome these limitations, the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) DRAM was recently introduced[1]. HBM-DRAM uses TSV and interposer technologies enabling multiple chip stacks and wide I/Os between the processor and memory: providing high capacity, low power and high bandwidth. This paper proposes the 2nd generation HBM to double the bandwidth from 128GB/s to more than 256GB/s and support pseudo-channel mode and 8H stacks [2]. In the pseudo-channel mode, a legacy channel is divided into two pseudo channels and the two pseudo channels share the command-address pins. Thus, one HBM has 16 pseudo channels instead of 8 legacy channels. To support various stack configurations including 8H stacks, a new architecture is adopted for flexible density ranging from 16Gb to 64Gb maintaining the same bandwidth. Finally, the bandwidth increase requires an active thermal solution to manage hotspots that develop from highly concentrated power consumption; we propose an adaptive refresh considering temperature distribution (ART) scheme as a solution."

With this market flow, diverse customers require various HBM product families. One customer requirement is full bandwidth with less density. Therefore, this work presents a HBM DRAM, which supports 4, 8, and even 2-hi stacks with full-bandwidth performance. The HBM DRAM adopts a peripheral base die architecture, which has smaller chip size and good testability resulting in more manufacturability. This architecture can compensate for process variation, since this problem among core dies within the same known good stacked die (KGSD) is the key issue of TSV-based stacked DRAM [1]. Layout aligning between PHY and TSVs improves the speed performance of the whole system due to reduced data skew. The peripheral base die contains address/command decoders (COMDEC), a core pipe-out (POUT) signal generator, and internal power, references and bias generators. A small-swing technique on a heavy load interface can reduce dynamic power and also has tolerance to process variations."

As promising candidates of next-generation mobile DRAM, the development of LPDDR4 [1] and wide-IO2 (WIO2) DRAM is ongoing these days. The conventional single data rate (SDR) wide IO DRAM [2] has achieved ×4 data bandwidth compared to LPDDR2 by increasing the number of IOs (e.g. 512 DQs). The WIO2 DRAM in this paper has 512 DQs, which is the same as SDR wide-IO DRAM, but by using double data rate (DDR) and operating at 1066Mb/s, its bandwidth achieves 68.2GB/s, which is quadrupled compared to LPDDR4 (single-die comparison). Moreover, since WIO2 DRAM is stacked in a 3D structure with the DRAM controller (system-in-package type), the input/output capacitance (CIO) is decreased and a power efficiency of 28mW/GB/s in READ operation mode is achieved."

       "abstract": "Today's multicore processors and complex multimedia SoCs incorporate power management techniques such as dynamic frequency scaling (DFS), which dynamically changes operating frequencies, and dynamic core-count scaling (DCCS), which rapidly power cycles the cores between active and idle states. For digital clocking in such SoCs, the PLL needs to support rapid frequency change and fast locking, both without frequency overshoot, so that SoCs can continue operation without interruption during DFS and start operation right after PLL reset is released during DCCS. Moreover, digital clocking PLLs are also required to have a wide frequency range, low period jitter (JP) and low power. Conventional PLLs like [1] use coarse and fine frequency tuning to achieve both low JP, as well as wide frequency range, but may produce frequency overshoots during initial binary frequency search and during DFS, which can span over multiple coarse bands. Furthermore, a conventional proportional-integral (PI) filter [2] suffers from a tradeoff between fast locking and frequency overshoot. These conventional approaches require the SoC to stop using the PLL clock for thousands of clock cycles to mask these frequency overshoots and cause overhead in DFS and DCCS optimization [6]. Another drawback of conventional PLLs [1-4] is the use of a linearly-tuned DCO (fixed frequency steps), which is not well suited for achieving both wide frequency range and constant JP measured in clock unit-interval percentage (%UI). A constant JP (%UI) is optimal for SoC digital clocking, as a constant percentage of the clock period can be allocated for clock-uncertainties during logic synthesis at any frequency. To address these issues, two techniques are proposed in this DPLL architecture: a) a dual-stage phase-acquisition-based loop filter (DALF), which incorporates a first-order loop for phase-acquisition to achieve fast locking without frequency overshoot, and b) a nonlinear DCO (NDCO), which achieves constant JP- across wide frequency range. Using these techniques, a digital PLL in 16nm CMOS achieves ±1.25%UI peak-to-peak JP (p-p JP) over a 0.5-to-9.5GHz range with a short lock-time of 1.2μs."

       "abstract": "Multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) are gaining popularity due to their superior noise performance over conventional phase-locked loops (PLLs) [1,2]. Recent designs are trending towards an all-digital implementation that provides advantages such as compact area, good scalability and low power compared to traditional analog implementations. Achieving fractional frequency multiplication is, however, not very straightforward in MDLLs as the digitally controlled oscillator's (DCO's) edge is periodically replaced by a clean reference edge. Recently, a fractional-N MDLL was proposed in [1], where the reference edges are realigned using a digital-to-time converter (DTC). One major drawback of MDLL-based frequency synthesis is that the reference spur is generated at the output spectrum due to the timing mismatch between the phase detection path and reference injection path. One of the contributors to this timing mismatch in fully digital MDLLs is the set-up time of the D flip-flop used for phase detection that creates a static phase-offset between the DCO and reference phase under locked condition. It is very difficult to accurately cancel this offset as any digital phase-detector (PD) or time-to-digital converter (TDC) used for cancellation will have an inherent offset. A spur cancellation technique was proposed in [2] employing a gated ring oscillator (GRO)-based TDC. However, it relies on correlated-double-sampling and requires a high-resolution high-linearity TDC, which increases design complexity and power consumption. Another shortcoming of previous designs is that the timing mismatch measurement was done by looking at the spur in the output spectrum using an extensive high frequency measurement setup. This introduces off-chip measurement error and makes in-situ timing compensation schemes infeasible without a sophisticated testing setup. Furthermore, the frequency domain data must be converted to time domain, which makes it difficult to accurately estimate the - xact timing mismatch. This paper proposes an all-digital fractional-N MDLL circuit where fractional-N generation is similar to the injection locking technique proposed in [3], but the advantages of subsampling techniques are utilized, hence removing the frequency divider in the feedback path. This reduces in-band phase noise and lowers power consumption. The same circuit can operate in either MDLL or PLL mode depending on the design requirement. A zero-phase-offset latch-based aperture phase-detector (APD) is designed to match the reference injection path and phase detection path precisely and thereby cancel the spur. Finally, we employ an in-situ timing detection scheme MDLL that directly measures the timing mismatch between the injected reference edge and different DCO edges, providing accurate time-domain data for MDLL characterization and tuning purposes."

       "abstract": "A multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) is an attractive architecture for a low-jitter clock generator, as it does not suffer much from jitter accumulation [1-4]. By periodically replacing the output edge of the oscillator by a clean edge of the reference, an MDLL has a large effective loop bandwidth for oscillator phase noise, which cannot be obtained in a PLL. With this advantage in mind, several MDLLs have been implemented recently [2], [3]. Unfortunately, these works are limited in their practical use as the frequency multiplication factor is only 4 [2] or 8 [3]. While the prior works show good jitter performance, it is primarily due to their wide effective loop bandwidth of nearly one hundred MHz that arises from using reference frequencies of 375 to 575MHz. It is much more challenging to achieve same level of jitter performance if the multiplication factor is increased and reference frequency is decreased. In this work, a low-power digital MDLL (DMDLL) with a multiplication factor of 32 is presented. To achieve low-jitter despite the large multiplication factor, a background-calibrated double-injection scheme is proposed which exploits both the rising and falling edge of the reference."

When digital circuits and a PLL with a ring oscillator are integrated together, the power supply noise may degrade the jitter performance of the PLL. To lower the supply-noise sensitivity of a PLL, several approaches [1-5] have been proposed. A passive decoupling capacitor and/or a low-dropout (LDO) regulator [1] can be used to suppress the supply noise. However, the decoupling capacitor occupies large area and the LDO requires additional power and area. In [2], a calibration mechanism is used to close and open the loop on an alternating basis, increasing the settling time. In [3], an extra foreground frequency calibration is needed to ensure the PLL is at the correct sub-band and supply voltage - it may be susceptible to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. The approach in [4] requires a low-frequency triangular signal generator, additional current sources, and active devices, increasing power and noise. In [5], two constant-gm bias circuits are used to cancel supply noise. However, it is sensitive to PVT variations, which may degrade the supply-noise suppression."

       "abstract": "Several research studies have considered replacing traditional analog PLLs with an all-digital PLL (ADPLL). In such studies, a key topic relates to the resolution and linearity of the TDC. Power-hungry techniques, such as a Vernier delay line (VDL) and a time amplifier (TA) [1,2], have been proposed to improve time resolution. Recently, a digital-to-time converter (DTC) has been employed to enable power reductions of the VDL and TA-based TDCs by minimizing the number of VDLs and TAs [3,4]. However, the nonlinearity of the DTC remains a problem, since it is much larger than the time resolution of the TDCs and becomes a significant source of fractional spur in the ADPLL. In [3], the effect of the nonlinearity is decreased by utilizing a dithering technique at the expense of a long calibration time (> 100ms). The DTC requires inherently more calibration effort for full-scale-delay detection and normalization, since the difference between the full-scale delay and the DCO period also increases the fractional spur significantly. On the other hand, time-to-amplitude-conversion-based TDCs may be another candidate for a high-resolution low-power TDC [5]. However, issues surrounding the nonlinearity of the charge pump (CP) and the full-scale-delay detection limit their utility."

       "abstract": "Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are de-facto clock generators in analog, digital, RF, and embedded systems to generate a high frequency output clock from a low frequency reference clock. Modern systems-on-chip (SoCs) require many such PLLs that cater to multi-core processors, memories, IO interfaces and power management. A ring-oscillator-based analog charge-pump PLL offers a flexible and power-efficient way to implement such clock multipliers. However, frequency compensation of analog PLLs requires a large loop filter capacitor that occupies significant area. The area penalty is further exacerbated in deep sub-micron CMOS processes due to increasing oscillator gain and gate leakage. For example, a 2GHz PLL in 65nm CMOS requires a 90pF capacitor (R=1kΩ) to achieve 10MHz bandwidth and 70° phase margin. Assuming a capacitor density of 1fF/μm2, a 90pF capacitor occupies an area of 0.09mm2. Digital PLLs (DPLLs) offer an attractive means to eliminate the loop-filter capacitor [1, 2]. However, quantization error added by its loop components degrades the performance in multiple ways. First, it makes the DPLL loop inherently non-linear causing the steady state to be a bounded limit cycle, which manifests as deterministic jitter (DJ) at the PLL output. Second, it introduces conflicting noise bandwidth requirements, which makes it difficult to achieve low jitter in a power efficient manner. For instance, suppressing TDC quantization error by reducing PLL bandwidth increases the DCO phase noise contribution. As a result, DCO power must be increased to lower its noise contribution. This is especially problematic in ring-oscillator-based DPLLs. Finally, a high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) needed to interface the DLF output to the ring oscillator typically occupies large area and negates some of the area benefits of DPLLs [1, 2]. In view of these drawbacks, we present a PLL architecture that combines the advantages of analog (- o quantization error) and digital PLLs (small area and scalability) by using a time-based integral path. The prototype PLL requires neither a high resolution DAC nor a capacitor and fits in 40μm×52μm (0.0021mm2) active area. It achieves 3.8psrms integrated jitter at 2.2GHz and consumes 1.82mW power."

       "abstract": "The vast unallocated frequency band lying above 275GHz offers enormous potential for ultrahigh-speed wireless communication. An overall bandwidth that could be allocated for multi-channel communication can easily be several times the 60GHz unlicensed bandwidth of 9GHz. We present a 300GHz transmitter (TX) in 40nm CMOS, capable of 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) 17.5Gb/s/ch signal transmission. It can cover the frequency range from 275 to 305GHz with 6 channels as shown at the top of Fig. 20.1.1. Figure 20.1.1 also lists possible THz TX architectures, based on recently reported above-200GHz TXs. The choice of architecture depends very much on the transistor unity-power-gain frequency fmax. If the fmax is sufficiently higher than the carrier frequency, the ordinary power amplifier (PA)-last architecture (Fig. 20.1.1, top row of the table) is possible and preferable [1-3], although the presence of a PA is, of course, not a requirement [4,5]. If, on the other hand, the fmax is comparable to or lower than the carrier frequency as in our case, a PA-less architecture must be adopted. A typical such architecture is the frequency multiplier-last architecture (Fig. 20.1.1, middle row of the table). For example, a 260GHz quadrupler-last on-off keying (OOK) TX [6] and a 434GHz tripler-last amplitude-shift keying (ASK) TX [7] were reported. A drawback of this architecture is the inefficient bandwidth utilization due to signal bandwidth spreading. Another drawback is that the use of multibit digital modulation is very difficult, if not impossible. An exception to this is the combination of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) and frequency tripling. When a QPSK-modulated intermediate frequency (IF) signal undergoes frequency tripling, the resulting signal constellation remains that of QPSK with some symbol permutation. Such a tripler-last 240GHz QPSK TX was reported [8]. However, a 16-QAM constellation, for example, would suffer severe distortion by frequency tripling. - f the 300GHz band is to be seriously considered for a platform for ultrahigh-speed wireless communication, QAM-capability will be a requisite."

While recent works have demonstrated high efficiency in Watt-level mm-Wave power amplifiers [1-5], most of the architectures operate over a limited frequency range, primarily dominated by the bandwidth of the output-matching or combiner networks. A frequency-agile power amplifier, therefore, needs a widely reconfigurable, yet an efficient output network, which is difficult to achieve with on-chip variable passives due to their poor quality factors in silicon IC processes. In this paper, we present an architecture where an optimal impedance at the output of each unit cell is synthesized exploiting their interaction in a non-isolated power-combiner network. By controlling the amplitude and phase of unit cells, close-to-optimal impedances can be synthesized over a wide operating range at mm-Wave frequencies thus enabling frequency agility. The chip is implemented in a 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS process and achieves Psat>22dBm between 40 and 65GHz and peak PAE>25% between 40 and 60GHz."

However, it is still a challenge implementing such arrays that are frequency and phase locked, with significant radiated power and efficiency in standard CMOS without costly additions. In this work we propose a scalable radiating-transmitter approach in 65nm CMOS that achieves a radiated power of +5.4dBm at 0.3THz using only a 2×3 on-chip array, an EIRP of +22dBm and 5.1% of radiated-power-to-DC power efficiency."

       "abstract": "THz region of electromagnetic spectrum has unique features making it attractive in spectroscopic studies, material inspection, tera-bit/sec communication, and biological- and non-biological-imaging applications. Owing to challenges in producing sufficiently strong signals, this region of spectrum has been exclusively served by III-V electronics or bulky cryogenic-temperature technologies such as QCLs [1]. Recently, advanced half-THz SiGe technologies and multi-element spatial power-combining techniques to increase the output power were successfully used to generate 0dBm of power at 0.53THz and -17dBm peak EIRP at 0.82THz [2-4]. Both solutions, however, suffer from low realized bandwidths (3%), limiting their utility in a slew of imaging and communication applications. Alternatively, high-quality accumulation-mode symmetric MOS varactors (SVARs) [5] in standard CMOS have been demonstrated as efficient odd-harmonic generators in broadband tripler and quintupler operating around 0.4THz [6] and 0.7THz [7], respectively. In this work, a 1.4THz multiplier chain of 10th order using MOS VARs in a 65nm standard CMOS process is demonstrated. The multiplier incorporates a new asymmetric VAR (ASVAR) for multiplication by 2 in addition to an SVAR for frequency quintupling. The circuit produces -13dBm peak EIRP at 1.33THz and operates over a setup-limited bandwidth of more than 11%. The fully integrated multiplier chain does not require any silicon lens or substrate thinning making it a compact and affordable solution for emerging THz applications."

Battery life and thermal limitations make power efficiency critical in the envisioned user-equipment (UE) phased-array transceivers, particularly for power amplifiers (PAs), which operate at 8-to-10dB power back-off (PBO) to transmit broadband, high-peak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR) signals with high fidelity. Higher yields and lower costs for integrated phased arrays make CMOS the preferred choice over other more-power-efficient technologies, e.g. GaAs. Furthermore, calibrating an integrated array of PAs, e.g. by using digital pre-distortion, is prohibitively complex for high-volume manufacturing. Thus, maximizing PAE of inherently linear CMOS PA circuits at PBO is a major challenge for future 5G UE radios."

       "abstract": "Nowadays, current passive mixers represent the state of the art for signal down-conversion in wireless receivers. In such kind of structures, noise, distortions and losses are strictly correlated to the performance of the stage following the mixer. The most common solution adopted to sense the down-converted current is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) in shunt with a capacitance to ground that assures a low input impedance when the loop gain of the amplifier decreases (Fig. 20.9.1a). A low input impedance is necessary to have a small voltage swing at the output of the mixer (typically few hundreds mV) to minimize the modulation of the switch resistance and with it the distortion produced during the downconversion. The input capacitance can also be used to filter the majority of the out-of-band interferers by transforming the TIA into a filter [1,2] (Fig. 20.9.1b). This reduces the dynamic range required by the TIA and its power consumption. This advantage comes at a cost of area, since the limited voltage swing tolerable at the input of the TIA demands a large capacitor to absorb the downconverted interferers. This trade-off is relaxed with the proposed solution (Fig. 20.9.2), where the input capacitance (C1) is partially boosted by a feedback network minimizing the swing required at the input of the TIA. This idea, originally proposed in [3] only to improve the 1dB compression point, is now used to maximize the spurious-free dynamic range of the TIA, exploiting an intrinsic in-band highpass shaping of noise and distortion. Furthermore, an adaptive transfer function, which improves its filtering action in presence of large out-of-band interferers, is realized."

To minimize the NF of a fully integrated RX front-end and to compensate for the low conversion gain and high noise of the following mixer, a broadband LNA with a gain in excess of 20dB showing a flat NF over more than a 15GHz bandwidth is required. Moreover, a variable-gain LNA design would be beneficial to accommodate environmental variability (e.g. atmospherics condition, rain, etc.). Prior works on CMOS car-radar transceivers have shown the feasibility of low-noise amplifiers at 79GHz. However, the bandwidth of these systems is limited to about 10GHz [2,3], which is not enough. This paper presents a 28nm-bulk-CMOS LNA for E-Band applications that employs transformer-based 4th-order inter-stage matching networks to achieve a 29.6dB gain over a 28.3GHz -3dB bandwidth (BW-3dB), resulting in a GBW product in excess of 0.8THz. The gain is variable from 29.6 to 18dB allowing an input-referred 1dB compression point (ICP1dB) that ranges from -28.1dBm at the highest gain to -12.3dBm at the lowest gain. The measured minimum in-band NF is 6.4dB, and the NF varies by less than 2dB from 68.1 to 90GHz. The LNA covers the two bands from 71 to 76GHz and from 81 to 86GHz with an almost uniform gain and NF and with a wide margin over desired specifications to compensate for PVT variations and model inaccuracy."

       "abstract": "The first four papers in this session focus on wireless sensing applications. They can be powered by harvesting energy from RF, piezoelectric, photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy sources. Many innovations focus on optimization of cold-start conditions in no-battery or dead-battery situations. Several techniques are used to minimize the number and size of external components such as inductors and capacitors. Maximum-Power-Point Tracking (MPPT) remains an important feature that needs optimization. The last four papers in the session focus on the fast-growing market of wireless charging for cell phones and wearables. The emphasis here is to comply with all the available standards (A4WP, Qi and PMA) with a single solution."

       "abstract": "The switched-capacitor power converter, also called a charge pump (CP), features no off-chip components and is suitable for the monolithic smart nodes in the internet of everything (IoE) [1]. To reduce the inevitable charge-redistribution loss (CRL) from a fixed conversion ratio (CR), reconfigurable CPs have been proposed to dynamically change their CRs for optimized harvesting efficiency [2,3]. However, they lacked the startup and self-sustaining capability [4], which are vital to the power-management unit for IoE. The clock generator of an energy harvester should oscillate with the initial low harvesting voltage. To realize the self-sustaining capability, the controller should rely on the harvested power of the CP, which implies an ultra-low power consumption. The conventional current-starved ring oscillator is not suitable for this microwatt power budget due to its correlated nature between speed, slew rate, and power consumption."

       "abstract": "A piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) converts vibration-induced mechanical stress into electrical charge. This conversion is optimized for cantilever-based generators when excited continuously in resonance. However, this is rarely achieved using ambient vibrations, where changes in excitation frequencies (fEX) and magnitudes, or shock excitations are more common [1]. The implemented system (Fig. 21.2.1) is a fully autonomous energy-harvesting interface based on the parallel-synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (SSHI) technique, also known as bias-flip [2], and can work with periodic as well as shock excitations. It allows enhanced ambient energy extraction by operating at an ideal rectified voltage (VBUF) [2] set by means of an optimal power point circuit (OPP). It operates with different harvesters and a wide variation of accelerations and excitation frequencies. The system achieves cold start-up and provides a configurable output voltage (VLDO) that can power systems such as wireless sensor nodes, biomedical or hand-held devices. It can use a single inductor by means of an inductor-sharing block (IS), and has over-voltage protection (OVP)."

       "abstract": "Energy harvesting has been considered to be a good solution to power many IoE applications [1-3]. Some applications require regulated supply voltage, while on the other hand, any extra energy should be stored in the storage element, such as a rechargeable battery, to maximize the total system efficiency. As the power delivery density is small in the energy-harvesting application, using a single inductor to transfer the power from the harvester to multiple outputs is achievable and efficient. The DITO architecture has three outputs as shown in Fig. 21.3.1: one is the regulated voltage output REG_OUT, the second is the unregulated voltage output SYS and the third is the rechargeable battery BAT. Due to the unpredictable environment conditions, the harvester could be in an environment without a corresponding energy source available for a long time. In order to keep the system operation without the harvester input VIN, the backup battery at BACK_UP is necessary, which would be the second power input of the system. The control scheme should make sure the backup battery only delivers power to the system when necessary in order not to waste any energy in the backup battery."

       "abstract": "Energy harvesting is an attractive solution to extend system lifetime for internet of everything (IoE) nodes. Ambient light is a common energy source that can be harvested by photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, light intensity varies widely depending on location, ranging from ~10s of lux in dim indoor conditions to ~100klux under direct sunlight. Designing a fully integrated light harvester that spans such a wide range of light intensity with high efficiency is challenging, especially since typically low PV cell voltage requires a high upconversion ratio and PV-cell voltage/current characteristics change significantly with light intensity. Boost DC-DC converters are a typical energy-harvesting solution with high conversion efficiency, but they require a large off-chip inductor and hence cannot be fully integrated, increasing system size [1-3]. Recently, switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters have been actively researched to enable fully-integrated energy harvesting using on-chip capacitors [4-6]. However, their efficiency has typically been limited to the 40-to-55% range at low input power levels (≤1μW) due to conduction/switching losses."

However, there are two main challenges: 1) strict safety regulations of incident power on human tissue; 2) small coil size for better biocompatibility. These issues reduce the received power at the coil, make it difficult to obtain sufficient power for implanted devices, and call for high power-efficiency (ηP)-transfer techniques, especially at very low received power levels."

Wirelessly-powered ICs that harvest energy from an RF beacon or from existing wireless signals can address challenges associated with battery size, capacity and replacements [1-5]. Given FCC transmit power limits, the operating range of wirelessly-powered sensors is limited by rectifier sensitivity rather than by communication link budgets. In this work, we present area-constrained antenna-rectifier architectures that leverage electrically-small antennas and rectifier circuits to achieve -34.5dBm sensitivity for 1.6V output with 1.8MΩ load (CC topology) and -24dBm sensitivity for 2.5V output with 100KΩ load (CP topology), representing a >5× improvement in sensitivity (>2× improvement in range) over current state-of-the-art and >1V output voltage [1]. Notably, this improvement is obtained even for cold-start with the typical rectifier storage capacitor as the only off-chip component, resulting in a very compact 1.2cm2 complete 2.4GHz antenna-rectifier system area."

       "abstract": "Wireless charging is developing into a standard feature of portable electronic devices to cut the last wire. Resonant wireless power transfer (R-WPT) using magnetic resonance emerges as a promising approach, as it provides spatial freedom and can charge multiple devices simultaneously. ISM-band frequencies such as 6.78MHz or 13.56MHz are commonly used as the resonant frequency of the LC tank [1-4]. The wireless power receiver usually adopts a two-stage topology [3,4]. The first stage is a rectifier for AC-DC conversion, and the second stage is a buck converter or an LDO for DC-DC regulation. The two-stage power processing degrades the efficiency and adds extra volume and cost. The resonant regulating rectifier (3R) of [1] implements a passive rectifier followed by a step-down charge pump to produce a regulated output voltage. It consists of 3 on-chip power switches, 5 off-chip diodes and 3 off-chip capacitors; and the mode selection between CCM and DCM has to be done manually. The 1×/2× reconfigurable resonant-regulating (R3) rectifier of [2] achieves one-stage power conversion plus voltage regulation using 5 on-chip switches and 1 off-chip capacitor. The output power is in the mW range, and it is not convertible to high-power applications such as 6W. The receivers above have a 5V output, and high-voltage transistors that occupy large silicon area have to be used."

There are 3 standards for the wireless power transfer (WPT): Qi [1], PMA [2] and A4WP [3]. The Qi and PMA use a similar frequency range from 100kHz to 300kHz. However, the A4WP uses a much higher frequency of 6.78MHz. Thus, to cover three applications, the easiest solution is to use two antennas covering both frequency ranges, and two rectifiers. However as shown in the bottom-left of Fig. 21.8.1, even in a 6.78MHz WPT situation, magnetic coupling occurs between a TX antenna and a low-frequency antenna. Therefore, both rectifiers will be activated and power loss due to the rectifiers will be increased."

The state-of-the-art neuromodulation implant [3] reports a 4-channel stimulator with wireless data and power links for small animal experiments, yet weighs 6g and has a volume of 3cm3. It is preferable that the implant package has a comparable size to its bioelectronics and a high-density stimulator to support stimulation with high spatial resolution. Furthermore, the epidural electrode should be soft and flexible because a mechanical mismatch exists at the tissue-electrode interface [1]. Unlike other implant/SoCs that stimulate with pre-loaded patterns [4-5], the implant for motor function recovery should be capable of adaptively adjusting its stimulation patterns at run time in response to the subject's varying physiological states [2]. Measuring the electrode-tissue impedance is also critical to ensure safe stimulation. Deriving the equivalent circuit model of the electrode-tissue interface determines the safe stimulation boundary (i.e. pulse width and intensity) to ensure the electrode overpotential is within the water window [6]. However, an SoC implementation of this function has not been reported."

       "abstract": "Heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) provide critical information about an individual's cardiovascular and mental health state. In either application, long-term observation is crucial to arrive at conclusive decisions and provide useful diagnostic feedback [1]. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) estimation of HR and HRV has emerged as an attractive alternative to ECG, as it provides electrode-free operation increasing patient comfort. However, PPG monitoring systems robust to low ambient light conditions and low perfusion conditions require a LED as a light source, which strongly dominates the power consumption of the complete system. Compressive sampling (CS) based PPG readouts promise to mitigate this LED power consumption [2], yet require large computational power to recover the signal, hindering real-time embedded processing on energy-scarce wearable devices. This paper presents a fully integrated, low-power PPG readout ASIC, completely integrating a single-channel readout front-end (AFE) and a 12b SAR ADC and a digital back-end (DBE) for embedded energy-efficient real-time information extraction, that advances the state-of-the-art on the following fronts: 1) By smartly duty-cycling all system components synchronously on a sparse non-uniform CS sampling pulse stream, the LED driver power is reduced up to 30x, without significant loss of information. 2) Moreover, the necessity of wireless off-loading, or for computationally intensive embedded signal reconstruction, is circumvented by enabling the direct extraction of HR and HRV information from the compressed data in real-time on the ASIC, while consuming only 172μW for the complete system."

       "abstract": "Event-driven DSPs have the advantage of activity-dependent power consumption [1], and event-driven neural networks have shown superior power efficiency in real-time recognition tasks [2]. A bio-inspired silicon cochlea [3] functionally transforms sound input into multi-frequency-channel asynchronous event output, and hence is the natural candidate for the audio sensing frontend of event-driven signal processing systems like [1] and [2]. High-quality event encoding can be implemented as level-crossing (LC) ADCs, but the circuits are area- and power-inefficient [1]. Asynchronous delta modulation, the original form of LC sampling, on the other hand can be compactly realized even in small pixels of vision sensors [4]. Traditional audio processing employs digital FFTs and BPFs after signal acquisition by high-precision ADCs. However, it has been shown in [5] that for classification tasks like voice activity detection (VAD), good accuracy can still be attained when filtering is performed using low-power analog BPFs. This paper presents a 0.5V 55μW 64×2-channel binaural silicon cochlea aiming for ultra-low-power IoE applications like event-driven VAD, sound source localization, speaker identification and primitive speech recognition. The source-follower-based BPF and the asynchronous delta modulator (ADM) with adaptive self-oscillating comparison for event encoding are highlighted for the advancement of the system power efficiency."

       "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a technique that stimulates nerves by electrical charge, but carries the risk of charge accumulation, voltage pile-up, electrode corrosion and finally tissue destruction. Using biphasic stimulus current pulses, the main transferred charge is compensated by reversing the current direction. However, due to PVT variations in integrated circuits mismatch in the biphasic waveform always occurs. Charge balancing (CB) has thus become an integral part of FES to ensure safe chronic stimulation [1]."

       "abstract": "In vivo recording of neural action-potential (AP) and local-field-potential (LFP) signals requires the use of high-resolution penetrating probes. Driven by the need for large-scale recording and minimal tissue damage, a technology roadmap has been defined for next-generation probes aiming to maximize the number of recording sites while minimizing the probe dimensions [1]. In this paper we present a 384-channel configurable active neural probe for high-density recording which implements in situ buffering under each electrode to minimize the crosstalk between adjacent metal lines along the shank and other parasitic effects inherent to traditional passive probes [2]. Up to 966 selectable, neuron-sized electrodes (12×12μm2) were densely packed along a narrow (70μm) and thin (20μm) implantable shank using integrated CMOS. With twice the number of electrodes compared to state-of-the-art neural probes [2], our design achieves the highest electrode count in a single shank reported so far."

       "abstract": "Continued data bandwidth scaling is essential in all segments of electronics, from low-power mobile to high-speed data centers. Each of these segments is faced with different constraints to bandwidth scaling, including power, process technology, and form factor. This session highlights how design and technology are keeping pace with bandwidth demands with innovations in both electrical and optical data links. It starts with a transceiver that combines an integrated regulator and rapid wake-up to scale data rate by 500?? while keeping energy-per-bit within a factor of 2??. The next paper describes a proximity communication link with 32Gb/s total bandwidth over four parallel capacitively coupled channels across a 1mm air gap. This is followed by a paper that implements a 5-tap DFE in a 4 ?? 6Gb/s display interface while overcoming the ft limits of 0.18??m CMOS. Two papers then introduce a 56Gb/s MZM-based TX and 2??64Gb/s optical TIA, respectively, demonstrating the next-generation path for optical bandwidth scaling. The session concludes with two high-speed wireline receivers that demonstrate <1pJ/bit energy efficiency at 30???40Gb/s and one that demonstrates fast DFE-IIR equalization adaptation."

       "abstract": "Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) [1] and burst-mode operation [2] are two promising methods to greatly improve energy efficiency of serial links. By varying supply voltage in accordance with the desired data rate/workload, DVFS scales link power almost quadratically with data rate. Because the time constant associated with changing the output of a DC-DC converter that provides the optimal link supply voltage is on the order of several microseconds, DVFS is effective only when rate of workload variations is slow. On the other hand, burst-mode communication, implemented using rapid on/off (ROO) links, linearly scales power consumption with effective data rate and is well-suited for interfaces where link inactive periods are short, on the order of few hundred nano-seconds or less. However, energy efficiency of ROO links degrades considerably at lower utilization levels due to leakage and static power consumed in the off state. Hence, DVFS and ROO techniques are best suited for workload variations with large and small time constants, respectively. In practice, their effectiveness also greatly depends on the integrity of supply voltage as it is stressed considerably more compared to always-on links operating at a fixed supply voltage. In this paper, we seek to combine DVFS and ROO approaches along with robust supply voltage generation and regulation techniques to achieve excellent energy efficiency across a wide range of data rates. The prototype source synchronous transceiver is implemented in a 65nm CMOS process and is packaged in a 10mm×10mm QFN package. It achieves less than 14ns wake-up time with 14.1-5.9pJ/b energy efficiency for the effective data rates varying from 16Mb/s to 8Gb/s."

       "abstract": "Proximity communication offers the convenience of a connector-less high-speed interface using energy-efficient mixed-signal transceivers [1-4]. Such interfaces are attractive for ultra-thin handheld/mobile devices with zero-insertion depth connectors on the periphery, modular phones, and hermetically sealed devices. Proximity communication near millimeter-range using inductive coupling is typically limited to relatively low sampling rates of <;1.25GS/s [1] due to inductor self-resonance. While interfaces using coupled transmission line (CTL) couplers are wideband (<;12GS/s) [2-3], implementations have been limited to a single-channel, which is likely due to inter-channel crosstalk. Multi-channel chip-to-chip communication using capacitive coupling has been demonstrated [4], albeit at a limited distance of 10μm. This work presents a 4-channel capacitively coupled interface (Fig. 23.2.1(a)) that supports an aggregate data-rate of 32Gb/s and up to 0.8mm air separation."

       "abstract": "The continuous increase in the resolution, color depth and refresh rate of TVs has driven the video data rate of the display panel interface from the timing controller to the pixel drivers in a typical 4K (UHD) TV to 36Gb/s. For the next generation 8K (Quad-UHD) TV, this number is expected to exceed 140Gb/s. The ever-increasing screen sizes pose an additional challenge by introducing high channel losses in the data lanes, requiring advanced equalization techniques such as decision feedback equalization (DFE) in the receiver, which hitherto has not been used in a display panel interface. At the same time, the requirement to integrate the receiver into the high-voltage pixel driver IC limits the technology of choice to 0.18μm CMOS. To achieve the required high-speed performance while accommodating process speed limitations, significant architectural and circuit improvements over the existing state-of-the-art are needed. This paper presents a complete 4-lane transceiver design, with each lane capable of operating up to 6Gb/s over a 24dB-loss channel while supporting both forwarded and embedded clocking modes. The receiver (Rx) in 0.18μm CMOS features a 5-tap quarter-rate predictive DFE (prDFE) architecture with the first tap implemented through body biasing, and taps 2-5 optimized to meet the timing requirement of the DFE feedback loop. The transmitter (Tx) in 65nm CMOS features a 3-tap FFE equalizer and a dual-VCO LC PLL with automatic resonance frequency tuning to cover a wide operating range."

       "abstract": "The ever-increasing data center IP traffic, up to 8.6 zettabytes per year by 2018 with nearly 3× growth since 2013 [1], requires power-efficient high-speed interconnects. Next generation optical interfaces will adopt 50Gbaud signaling [2], and minimizing power consumption is key to enable the use of small form-factor optical modules for electro-optical conversion. In this perspective, silicon photonics is an attractive alternative to discrete photonics, lending itself to higher miniaturization at reduced cost [3]. Furthermore, silicon photonics enables co-design of electronics with photonics, thus optimizing transceiver power efficiency. In particular, the electro-optical transmitter constitutes the main source of power consumption. Travelling wave Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) architectures are used in discrete photonics realizations as data rate increases, and lend themselves to silicon photonics. However silicon photonics suffers from electrical propagation losses and bandwidth limitations of integrated transmission lines, requiring equalization in the electronic driver to address 50Gbaud operation at moderate consumption and also in advanced node technologies. In this work, we employ a bifilar transmission line determining an electrical propagation loss of ~3dB/mm at 28GHz. Using an equalizer counteracts its effect, applying passive boost and shunt peaking in the pre-driving stage, combined with passive peaking in the load coupling. A 75% increase in the vertical aperture of the optical eye diagram is thus achieved with no power consumption penalty due to the equalizer. The complete electro-optical transmitter, operating at 56Gb/s at 1310nm wavelength, dissipates 300mW and ensures an extinction ratio (ER) higher than 2.5dB. This 56Gb/s silicon photonics transmitter displayes more than 30% power savings with respect to the state-of-the-art [4]."

Equalizer adaptation is required to maintain signal integrity in time-varying channel and circuit conditions. Robust adaptation algorithms suitable for discrete-time (DT) DFEs are well-established, but there are few examples of adaptive algorithms for IIR DFEs [2,4], each exhibiting relatively slow convergence, additional high-bandwidth hardware and/or requiring the input data statistics to meet specific criteria. In this work, a 16Gb/s IIR DFE is integrated into a CDR, and the adaptation algorithm makes use of signals available in a regular binary phase detector (PD) to simultaneously adapt the IIR and DT taps. The novel algorithm provides faster and more robust convergence than has been previously demonstrated for IIR DFEs."

       "abstract": "3D imaging devices, such as stereo and time-of-flight (ToF) cameras, measure distances to the observed points and generate a depth image where each pixel represents a distance to the corresponding location. The depth image can be converted into a 3D point cloud using simple linear operations. This spatial information provides detailed understanding of the environment and is currently employed in a wide range of applications such as human motion capture [1]. However, its distinct characteristics from conventional color images necessitate different approaches to efficiently extract useful information. This paper describes a low-power vision processor for processing such 3D image data. The processor achieves high energy-efficiency through a parallelized reconfigurable architecture and hardware-oriented algorithmic optimizations. The processor will be used as a part of a navigation device for the visually impaired (Fig. 24.1.1). This handheld or body-worn device is designed to detect safe areas and obstacles and provide feedback to a user. We employ a ToF camera as the main sensor in this system since it has a small form factor and requires relatively low computational complexity [2]."

Many important applications with inherent robustness to reduced precision for matrix multiplication, e.g. inference for neural networks [1], can take advantage of analog signal processing for energy efficiency. This work presents a 64-cycle programmable passive Switched-Capacitor Matrix Multiplier (SCMM) with co-designed bitline-less memory. The design exploits 300aF unit fringe capacitors for high speed and low energy charge-domain processing and contains the input DAC, multiply-and-accumulate SAR ADC, and local memory. Two applications of the SCMM are demonstrated: 1) an analog front-end for an image classifier system, which reduces A/D conversions by 21x and multiply-and-accumulate compute energy by 11x over a conventional system, and 2) a co-processing accelerator to solve Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization, which achieves a measured 7.7 TOPS/W at 2.5GHz."

These applications take in noisy inputs with relatively low quantization, such as 8-bits/color for video, or 8-bit audio samples, or 1b-to-2b digitized baseband signals. However, a sufficiently large amount of data allows noise rejection, and an accurate answer can be computed. This large-data-to-narrow-result property makes these applications a good fit for analog calculation, which also has limited resolution and inherent noise, but can offer higher energy efficiency than digital implementations."

Classical solid-state down-conversion architectures can achieve much higher resolution but require a large bank of frequency synthesizers and multipliers to generate LO frequencies covering the entire band [1,2]. Evidently, enabling frequency generation on-chip covering the large frequency band (40 to 330GHz in this case) operating above fmax of the solid-state technology is impractical [3,4]."

       "abstract": "Terahertz imaging has been gaining increasing attention for its emerging applications in security, biomedical and material characterization. Previous works have demonstrated terahertz imagers on silicon: in [1], the authors demonstrated a 280GHz 4×4 array and an 860GHz pixel using Schottky-barrier diodes; in [2], a 0.7-to-1.1THz 1k-pixel camera was presented. Unfortunately, most previous works are based on incoherent direct detection (Fig. 25.5.1), which causes low sensitivity due to the output droping quickly with input power (∝VRF2), and, as a result, need exceedingly high power sources for illumination. This problem can be alleviated by utilizing coherent heterodyne detection scheme (Fig. 25.5.1), in which the terahertz input (RF) mixes with a local oscillation (LO) signal and generates an output with the amplitude proportional to VRFVLO. As the LO power is normally significantly higher than RF, the sensitivity is much enhanced. Moreover, as the output also carries the RF phase information (φRF), digital beamforming is achievable. For a better comparison, an NPN transistor is configured both as a direct detector (input power injected from the emitter) and a heterodyne detector (-20dBm LO power pumped into the base). The simulated output current with different input power is shown in Fig. 25.5.1, in which we observe a sensitivity enhancement of more than 40dB. However, this coherent sensing scheme introduces a great challenge of synchronizing the frequencies of the transmitter (TX) radiated signal and the receiver (RX) LO. Fortunately, phase-locked terahertz sources have been demonstrated on silicon [3,4]. In this paper, a fully integrated 320GHz high-sensitivity coherent-imaging transceiver chipset is demonstrated."

       "abstract": "Various Ultra-Low-Power (ULP) RX architectures [1-4] for Bluetooth™ Low Energy (BLE) have been developed for minimizing the RX power consumption. A PLL-based RX architecture [1] is very attractive to improve the energy efficiency. While the single-channel configuration without multi-bit ADC realizes under 3mW power consumption and over -90dBm sensitivity, the 2nd and 3rd Adjacent Channel Interference Rejections (ACRs) do not meet the BLE requirements. Although the ACR can be improved by inserting high-order LPFs into the regeneration loop, it critically degrades the closed-loop stability. The Sliding IF (SIF) architecture is an alternative approach to overcome the ACR issue with high-energy efficiency. The reported receivers in [2,3] succeed in achieving over 20dB ACR, however, the SIF still has a problem of low out-of-band blocker tolerance because of unwanted signal at the image frequency. An off/on chip bandpass filter inserted at the front of the LNA can reject the image signal, which incurs a signal loss and degrades the energy efficiency of the RX. This paper presents a new PLL-based RX with hybrid loop that achieves over 20dB 2nd/3rd ACR without any external RF filters. The proposed RX employs two key features: (1) the high-interference-tolerance hybrid-loop structure based on an ADPLL, and (2) a novel single-channel receiving method, which enables the conversion of the constellation from FSK to a differential BPSK (DBPSK) signal."

IEEE 802.11ah is a new Wi-Fi protocol optimized for Internet-of-Everything (IoE) applications. Compared to other IoE standards like Bluetooth or ZigBee, its sub-GHz carrier frequency and mandatory modes with 1MHz/2MHz channel bandwidths allow devices to operate in a longer range with scalable data-rates from 150kb/s to 2.1Mb/s. Moreover, the use of OFDM improves link robustness against fading, especially in urban environments, and achieves a higher spectral efficiency. The key design challenges of an IEEE 802.11ah TX for IoE applications are to meet the tight spectral mask and error-vector-magnitude (EVM) requirements as for conventional Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11n/g), while achieving low power consumption required by IoE applications. The presented TX applies a fully-digital polar architecture with a 1V supply, and it achieves more than 10× power reduction compared to the state-of-the-art OFDM transceivers [1-4]. Without any complicated PA pre-distortion techniques as in [5], it passes all the PHY requirements of the mandatory modes in IEEE 802.11ah with 4.4% EVM, while consuming 7.1mW with 0dBm output power."

       "abstract": "We are approaching the age of IoE, in which wearable devices such as smart watches will be widespread. Sensing processors play a key role and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is considered fundamental. Power consumption is one of the most important characteristics for such sensing processors. However, current GNSS receivers consume around 10mW [1,2] and are difficult to be embedded. GNSS receivers require high supply voltage for low-noise RF, which contributes to large power consumption. We developed 0.7V RF circuits that enable effective use of FD-SOI. Among the RF circuits, an LNA and an LPF are the key to 0.7V operation. We implemented an LNA with DC feedback using an OPAMP and an LPF that is composed of OTAs that have positive feedback as well as a mechanism for adjusting the output common-mode voltage."

Mixer-first receivers have been able to achieve excellent out-of-band (OOB) linearity even with noise cancellation [3], but only for far-out blockers due to only first-order baseband filtering. Higher-order baseband filters give sharper filtering, but are not as linear [4], while high-order active N-path filters have poor S11 [2]. DT approaches are also limited by the linearity of the front-end LNTA [1]. Hence, new approaches are needed to handle large blockers that are close to the signal band."

       "abstract": "We present a millimeter-scale near-field radio system for ultra-low-power (ULP) healthcare sensor nodes. It is specifically designed for `syringe implantation' which minimizes invasiveness of implantation. Designing a millimeter-scale wireless node for implanted healthcare is challenging because: 1) the antenna is constrained to the diameter of the syringe needle, which significantly constrains the link distance through RF. 2) The energy/power are strictly limited by the millimeter-scale form-factor where thin-film batteries can source only <;10μAh and sustain <;50μA peak current. Recent works [1-4] have demonstrated near-field transceivers for millimeter-scale implants. Passive backscatter radios consume low power but they are only operable at very short distances (e.g., 3.5cm) due to excessive path loss and self-jamming at the reader [1-2]. Although active radios can provide >10cm distance, their high power consumption (45mW [3]) and/or large antenna size (2.3cm×2.4cm [4]) make them impractical for implanted healthcare applications."

Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) is used in many consumer IoE devices now because it offers the lowest average power for a radio that can communicate directly to a mobile device [1]. The BLE standard requires that the IoE device continuously advertises, which initiates the connection to a mobile device. Sub-1s advertisement intervals are common to minimize latency. However, this continuous advertising results in a typical minimum average power of 10's of μW at low duty-cycles. This leads to the quoted 1-year lifetimes of event-driven IoE devices (e.g. tracking tags, ibeacons) that operate from coin-cell batteries. This minimum power is too high for robust, batteryless operation in a small form-factor."

This paper proposes an N-Path Switched-Capacitor (SC) Gain Loop that is reconfigurable as an RF-tunable transmitter (TX) or RX with LO-defined center frequency. Comparatively, a SAW-less RX should be able to amplify a weak in-band (IB) signal in the presence of large out-of-band (OB) blockers, whereas a SAW-less TX should be able to deliver a large IB signal with low spectral leakage and OB noise. Such discrepancy inspires exploration of an RX-TX-compatible N-path technique to realize a multiband transceiver (TXR) with zero on-chip inductors and external matching components. Our TXR aims at the multiband LTE standard, and comparable performances are achieved at a die size 24× smaller than the recent art [2, 3]."

       "abstract": "A dual-rate hybrid DAC is proposed in [1] that shows a path toward high speed/linearity in scaled technology. In this hybrid architecture, the resolution of the DAC is achieved through an oversampled LSB path, while its output power is mostly delivered by a Nyquist MSB path, resulting in a reduced number of current-steering cells and relaxed amplitude-matching requirement via digital pre-distortion in the LSB path. To further extend the DAC bandwidth, this architecture incurs high cost, such as higher oversampling ratio in the LSB path and an increasing number of MSB bits. Both cases can increase the complexity of the analog circuit. Moreover, when the DAC output frequency is higher, timing error effects (including delay and duty-cycle errors) become more important than that of the amplitude error. In this work, we propose: a) an in-band noise-cancellation scheme that extends the overall bandwidth with less overhead, and b) a pulsed timing-error pre-distortion scheme to achieve high linearity at higher frequencies. A proof-of-concept 12b 2GS/s hybrid DAC is implemented in 65nm CMOS that achieves 96 to 74dBc SFDR from DC to 1GHz Nyquist band, which is higher than that of the state-of-the-art high-speed (>1GS/s) CMOS DACs reported in [2-4], compared at the same output frequencies. The proposed pulsed timing error pre-distortion scheme also improves the SFDR from 68 to 74dBc at 949MHz, which confirms its effectiveness when the signal frequency is high."

       "abstract": "The successive-approximation-register (SAR) architecture is well-known for its high power efficiency in medium-resolution A/D conversions. Together with time interleaving, it can challenge the regime of flash ADCs in high-speed, low-resolution applications [1]. However, when considered for high-precision, low-speed sensor readout interfaces, SAR ADCs suffer from nonlinearity resulting from capacitor mismatch and limited dynamic range due to comparator noise. Previous works [2-3] adopt oversampling to shift noise and nonlinearity into high frequencies. Dithering and chopping are used in [2] to modulate harmonic distortion and flicker noise out of signal bandwidth, achieving an in-band SFDR of 87.1dB and an SNDR of 79.1dB along with data-driven noise reduction. Noise shaping proposed in [3] suppresses the in-band noise around 10dB at a low oversampling ratio (OSR) of 4 with no linearity improvement. DAC nonlinearity can also be calibrated digitally, but to achieve an INL down to ±2ppm [4], calibration of capacitor 2nd-order voltage coefficients is required. This work presents a DAC mismatch error shaping (MES) scheme for oversampling SAR ADCs to achieve a 105dB in-band SFDR without calibration. The DAC mismatch errors are 1st-order high-pass filtered by simply inserting one extra phase into the SAR operation. Noise shaping is adopted to suppress the comparator thermal and flicker noise. The prototype achieves a peak SNDR of 101dB over 1kHz bandwidth with a Schreier FOM of 178.9dB and can be configured to conventional SAR mode up to 5MS/s. The proposed techniques enable the application of power-efficient SAR ADCs for high-precision, multi-purpose sensor readout interfaces."

       "abstract": "To support growing data bandwidths, high-speed moderate-resolution ADCs have become vital for high-speed serial links. Interleaved SAR ADCs achieve high sampling speeds and good energy efficiency. However a challenge is that these ADCs are large and therefore suffer from interleaving artifacts related to size [1]. Compact, efficient SAR ADCs are needed to address this problem. As an alternative, multiple-bit-per-cycle SAR ADCs deliver high speed from a single SAR ADC, but at the cost of significant added complexity (i.e., extra quantizers and capacitor DACs) and die area [2,3]. This work addresses the need for a fast, compact SAR ADC, with a 1GS/s SAR ADC that has the best Walden FOM and the smallest area among 5-to-6.3b ADCs published in ISSCC (see Fig. 27.3.1)."

       "abstract": "In recent years, the operation speed of SAR ADCs has improved with the scaling of CMOS technology. SAR ADCs achieve a few hundreds of MS/s with 8-to-10b resolution. The SNR of high-speed SAR ADCs is mainly dominated by comparator noise and usually limited to 50 to 60dB. The power consumption increases exponentially to suppress comparator noise in a limited comparison time to improve SNR. Noise-tolerant SAR ADCs [1] reduce comparator power in the first few bit cycles by using a coarse comparator. However, the fine comparator in the remaining bit cycles still consumes significant power to achieve an SNR greater than 60dB. SAR-assisted pipelined ADCs [2,3] do not require a low-noise comparator, but design restrictions in advanced CMOS processes make high-performance amplifier design challenging. Using a low-gain or a dynamic amplifier induces gain errors between stages. Besides, the amplifier and back-end stages result in extra noise and area. Digital-slope ADCs [4] are inherently low-noise by quantizing the signal in the time domain, but the hardware cost grows exponentially with resolution and the maximum conversion rate is halved with each additional bit of resolution. Hence this ADC type is unattractive for resolutions higher than 8b. This paper reports a 12b hybrid ADC combining a 7b low-power SAR coarse ADC with a 6b low-noise digital-slope fine ADC. The 100MS/s ADC achieves 64.43dB SNDR at Nyquist input with 0.35mW from a 0.9V supply."

       "abstract": "In recent years, we have seen the emergence of multi-GS/s medium-to-high-resolution ADCs. Presently, SAR ADCs dominate low-speed applications and time-interleaved SARs are becoming increasingly popular for high-speed ADCs [1,2]. However the SAR architecture faces two key problems in simultaneously achieving multi-GS/s sample rates and high resolution: (1) the fundamental trade-off of comparator noise and speed is limiting the speed of single-channel SARs, and (2) highly time-interleaved ADCs introduce complex lane-to-lane mismatches that are difficult to calibrate with high accuracy. Therefore, pipelined [3] and pipelined-SAR [4] remain the most common architectural choices for high-speed high-resolution ADCs. In this work, a pipelined ADC achieves 4GS/s sample rate, using a 4-step capacitor and amplifier-sharing front-end MDAC architecture with 4-way sampling to reduce noise, distortion and power, while overcoming common issues for SHA-less ADCs."

Therefore, many time-interleaved SAR ADCs are used in a distributed sampling scheme, leaving the timing-skew problem to be resolved by calibration. Only a few timing-skew calibration algorithms have been reported for interleaved ADCs to correct timing error in the analog domain [1,2] or in the digital domain [3]. The drawback of analog correction includes the feedback-induced stability hazard and jitter introduced by the controlled delay line. Digital-domain correction takes advantage of technology scaling but the complex slope-extraction filter limits signal bandwidth. The reported ADC demonstrates a digital timing-skew correction technique incorporated with a delta-sampling technique, and achieves a 2.6GHz sampling rate and a wide signal bandwidth."

In scaled technologies, power challenges have been addressed using SAR architectures, often in combination with techniques like redundancy, asynchronous operation, and time interleaving to meet the application sampling rate requirements. However, for high-resolution ADCs (9b+ ENOB), a traditional SAR is intrinsically energy-inefficient since it reuses the same low-noise comparator to perform both coarse conversions (where little accuracy is needed) and fine conversions (where thermal noise is of paramount importance). This is addressed in [1,2] with hybrid SAR-pipeline architectures that employ SAR as subADCs, but whose noise performance is determined by a high-efficiency interstage amplifier as opposed to the comparator."

Screening by micro-NMR is repeatable, versatile and low-cost as it is label- and washing-free for the samples, and immobilization-free for the electrodes. Herein, a high-sensitivity micro-NMR CMOS platform with magnetic (B)-field stabilization and thermal management is reported (Fig. 28.1.1).

       "abstract": "The water present in the close vicinity of biomolecules is particularly relevant to the function of the biomolecules and is termed “biological water” in contrast to ordinary “bulk water” that fills the region beyond this vicinity (Fig. 28.3.1). Many studies have revealed that these two types of water exhibit clear differences in their dielectric relaxations. First, bulk water has two major relaxation modes: (i) the first mode represents the dielectric relaxation of the cooperative organization of hydrogen-bonded water molecules with a time constant τd (≈8ps), and (ii) the second mode exhibits a faster relaxation time constant τf (≈0.27ps) and is usually attributed to the rotation of the water molecules that are not involved in hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, a slower relaxation (τs) appears in biological water because of “bound water” that is strongly bonded to biomolecules and less movable compared with bulk water. Owing to the presence of τs-mode water, the fractions of τd- and τf-mode waters in biological water are smaller than those in bulk water. In this manner, the existence and status of biological water is reflected in the complex dielectric constant at a frequency around 100GHz. Because the ionic polarization of electrolytes (e.g., Na, K, Ca) strongly affects the dielectric loss in the frequency range lower than 50GHz, a difficulty arises in differentiating the dielectric relaxations of water from that of the ionic polarization [2]. By limiting the observation frequency to higher than 50GHz, we can eliminate this difficulty. By focusing on the dielectric relaxations of biological water, we present a CMOS biosensor IC that can detect and visualize the target biomolecules by using biological water as a label."

Since data is collected on one chip, precise synchronization between data streams is possible, allowing to use correlation techniques between the data streams.

       "abstract": "Emerging applications in personal healthcare require sensor SoCs with low area, low power and a high dynamic range. Design in small-scale technologies can reduce the power and area of digital processing. However, due to the accompanied reduced supply voltage (VDD), the analog front-end (AFE) faces significant challenges in maintaining a large dynamic range in a power- and area-efficient manner [1-3]. A large dynamic range is important to handle the large signals expected during motion [1]. In this paper, we demonstrate a 0.6V ECG readout in 40nm technology for ambulatory applications. It can handle up to 40mVpp AC-signal and up to 300mV DC-electrode offset while consuming 3.3μW power and 0.015mm2 area. These results are achieved by implementing a time-domain-based readout architecture that focuses on scalable design techniques and especially avoids high-gain opamps and large passives. The AFE achieves more than 5× increase in AC dynamic range compared with previous work with similar silicon area and similar VDD [2], without compromising on the power consumption (see Fig. 28.5.6)."

       "abstract": "Neural signal recordings have been an essential tool for understanding the brain and driving the progress in neuroscience research and therapy. The local field potential (LFP) signals, which span from 3Hz to about 200Hz, serve as indicators of various neurological behaviors and disorders. Prior integrated LFP recording front-ends are designed for a small-signal input of a few mV, limiting the dynamic range to <;60 dB [1-3]. For closed-loop neuromodulation, featuring simultaneous neural recording and stimulation, it is important to observe and understand brain dynamics during stimulation. Stimulation artifacts can range between 10 and 100mV and last for several milliseconds. The stimulation patterns result in significant artifact power inside the LFP band that cannot be filtered using conventional techniques. To adaptively reject stimulation artifacts in the digital domain, it is desired to capture the neural signal combined with the artifact with a high linearity. This requirement pushes the front-end dynamic range requirement to about 80dB for ±50mV input range, 20dB beyond the capabilities of current integrated recording front-ends."

       "abstract": "Digital circuits have been driving the development of IC technologies for decades and they cover by far the widest share of the IC market. Analog and RF circuits, on the other hand, are essential for implementing crucial functions in electronic systems and require highly qualified and skilled designers. As a result, a widespread opinion is that there will always be demand for competent analog and RF engineers. However, others argue that digital electronics is eventually going to dominate and that the need for analog engineers will be limited. As a result, for the past several decades, the camps of analog and digital engineers have been debating the year in which their opponents' discipline will become obsolete. On top of this there is the common misconception that analog, RF, and power electronics circuit seem to be more of a whimsical art than a systematic science when compared to digital and memory. In this context, what is the best choice for students? Is it worth pursuing the whimsical art of analog electronics, or is it better to focus entirely on digital systems and software? This panel will try to answer these basic questions, exploiting the know-how of top educators and industry experts from both camps."

       "abstract": "It is well known that CMOS technology scaling benefits digital circuits and systems, but creates numerous challenges for analog/RF circuit designers. Analog and RF operating frequencies have ceased to noticeably improve as wiring dominates over raw transistor performance. The shrinking supply voltage limits dynamic range while gate-leakage mismatch dominates over conventional mismatch mechanisms. As this analog-digital divide widens below the 20nm technology node, it becomes important to ask: Should we continue to downscale our radios? Do analog and RF designers need to \"get with the program\" and figure out how to design in radically scaled technologies? Will analog and RF circuits look increasingly \"digital\"? Or, will economic forces rule all, and the high cost of scaled technologies eventually dictate a two-chip \"best node for the operating mode\" solution?"

       "abstract": "Modeled after the US game show Family Feud, this event features two teams (assisted by the audience) that will compete to name the most popular responses to survey questions related to data converters. The teams are composed of world-renowned data-converter experts. Survey questions probe both professional and personal aspects, for example: What is the first thing you would do after you tape-out? What excuse would you make to your manager to get more time to tape-out? What is the most common cause of data-converter design failure? What would you do first if you made $10M from your start-up? The audience will take sides and participate to help their favorite team in case they are having difficulty. This is an opportunity to learn how others in the field cope with various situations and also get a glimpse into their lighter-hearted side of life."

       "abstract": "The Internet of Everything (IoE) is today one of the main drivers for further development in the semiconductor industry. Academic research is also focusing on this application domain. The Internet of Everything poses new challenges to circuit design mainly for the creation of energy efficient design of IoE nodes. The holistic view on IoE projects the presence of several layers of hardware in the IoE system ranging from tiny sensor nodes all around in the environment, over user terminals to huge server infrastructure. The layer closest to the physical world is that of the sensor nodes. For these nodes to be omnipresent, they will have to be running on an independent supply - either batteries that last for years or energy harvesting. Ultra-efficient, low-energy design is a key asset in this context."

Are there any other revolutions in sight? What circuits and system innovations can ISSCC bring forward to enable the next killer applications? What unique technology elements, device structures and memory architectures will be required? Should we continue with silicon technology and seek breakthroughs in system architecture, algorithms, SoC integration and packaging? Or, are we preparing for \u201cbeyond silicon\u201d technologies?

        "abstract": "Communications inside vehicles is experiencing a growing demand due to emerging applications, like infotainment, driver assistance, safety systems and diagnostics, requiring data-rates per channel beyond what is offered by current solutions. The number of network nodes per car has steeply increased, and the number of communication ports per year shipped for the automotive market has reached the 650-million level (Sources: IMS, SA, Gartner). Considering that cabling is the third highest cost factor and the third heaviest component in the car (Source: IEEE), there is a clear need to go beyond the current low data-rate solutions and converge to a high data-rate backbone network. Several solutions, both electrical and optical, are being discussed and proposed by car makers and silicon manufacturers. What are the future solutions going to look like, and what challenges will they pose to the solid-state circuits community?",

        "abstract": "Radio-frequency performance is limited by fundamental constraints in dynamic range, as CMOS scaling continues to push supply voltages lower. The receiver needs to reject large in-band and out-of-band blockers while detecting small desired signals. The transmitter needs to maintain high efficiency and low distortion, while processing signals with wider bandwidths and higher peak-to-average ratios to support high data rates. Recent developments in RF transceiver design utilize techniques that cancel noise and distortion in receiver and transmitter signal paths. Digital circuits and calibration are increasingly being used to aid radio performance and allow area reduction. This Forum will present advanced circuit design techniques that demonstrate the current state-of-the-art. System specifications will be discussed to provide context for the required circuit enhancements. The first three talks will focus on noise and distortion cancellation techniques used in receivers. The next three talks will focus on transmitter design including both digital and analog linearization techniques. Finally, the last talk will introduce in-device co-existence issues and solutions for wireless systems that require multiple radios operating concurrently. This Forum is aimed at circuit designers and engineers active in radio-transceiver and wireless-system design.",

It continues by discussing particular challenges presented by the design of frequency synthesizers and their interaction with the rest of the system. The first three talks provide insights into the design of frequency generators: harmonic oscillators, ring oscillators, and MEMS topologies. The fourth presentation deals with various single-and dual-modulus divider topologies necessary for wireless or wireline applications. Then, frequency synthesizers for millimeter-wave wireless communications and PLLs for wireline applications are presented. The last two talks give an overview of the main challenges in clock distribution for both microprocessors and RF analog transceivers.

        "abstract": "Technology awareness and modeling is important in all areas of mixed-signal and RF design. This forum intends to provide a holistic overview and discussion spanning a variety of important topics in device modeling, reliability and simulation in next-generation CMOS. It begins with an analog/RF-centric comparison between FinFET and ultra-thin-body SOI technology. The next two talks then venture into bias stress and Electrostatic Discharge Protection (ESD), which are two issues of ever-increasing importance for future scaling. The fourth presentation discusses the latest developments surrounding the popular BSIM transistor model, and explains how this new model can be efficiently coupled to the analog/RF design process. Motivated by their increasing significance in integrated RF transceivers, the next talk outlines a future roadmap for passive components in scaled technologies. Then, we expand upon modeling challenges that arise when components are stacked in three dimensions. Finally, this series of modeling talks is rounded up by two comprehensive presentations that summarize key challenges from the foundry and EDA tool vendor perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Anyone wishing to drive advances in computing technology must carefully negotiate key trade-offs. First, reducing power consumption is increasingly critical. Consumers want improved battery life, size, and weight for their laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Likewise, data-center power demands and cooling costs continue to rise. Concurrent is the demand for improved performance that enables compelling new user experiences. Users want to access devices through more natural interfaces (speech and gesture); they also want devices to manage ever-expanding volumes of data (home movies, pictures, and a world of content available in the cloud). An essential part of making these new user experiences available is programmer productivity; software developers must easily be able to tap into new capabilities by using familiar, powerful programming models. Finally, it is increasingly important that software be supported across a broad spectrum of devices; developers cannot sustain today's trend of re-writing code for an ever expanding number of different platforms.",

        "abstract": "Standards such as OIF CEI-25G, CEI-28G and 32G-FC require transceivers operating at high data rates over imperfect channels. Equalizers are used to cancel the inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency-dependent channel losses such as skin effect and dielectric loss. The primary objective of an equalizer is to compensate for high-frequency loss, which often exceeds 30dB at fs/2. However, due to the skin effect in a PCB stripline, which starts at 10MHz or lower, we also need to compensate for a small amount of loss at low frequency (e.g., 500MHz). Figure 2.1.1 shows simulated responses of a backplane channel (42.6dB loss at fs/2 for 32Gb/s) with conventional high-frequency equalizers only (4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), 1st-order continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with a dominant pole at fs/4, and 1-tap DFE) and with additional low-frequency equalization. Conventional equalizers cannot compensate for the small amount of low-frequency loss because the slope of the low-frequency loss is too gentle (<;3dB/dec). The FFE and CTLE do not have a pole in the low frequency region and hence have only a steep slope of 20dB/dec above their zero. The DFE cancels only short-term ISI. Effects of such low-frequency loss have often been overlooked or neglected, because 1) the loss is small (2 to 3dB), 2) when plotted using the linear frequency axis which is commonly used to show frequency dependence of skin effect and dielectric loss, the low-frequency loss is degenerated at DC and hardly visible (Fig. 2.1.1a), and 3) the long ISI tail of the channel pulse response seems well cancelled at first glance by conventional equalizers only (Fig. 2.1.1b). However, the uncompensated low-frequency loss causes non-negligible long-term residual ISI, because the integral of the residual ISI magnitude keeps going up for several hundred UI. As shown by the eye diagrams in the inset of Fig. 2.1.1(b), the residual long-term ISI resul- s in 0.42UI data-dependent Jitter (DDJ) that is difficult to reduce further by enhancing FFE/CTLE/DFE, but can be reduced to 0.21UI by adding a low-frequency equalizer (LFEQ). Savoj et al. also recently reported long-tail cancellation [2].",

At 20 to 40Gb/s data-rates, loop-unrolled DFEs are widely adopted to relieve the feedback timing constraints of the initial tap(s) [1]. However, loop-unrolling introduces additional delay into the critical paths of later (non-unrolled) DFE taps due to the selection MUXes, and with its exponential growth in complexity, does not scale well as the number of unrolled taps increases. Perhaps due to this challenge, no multi-tap DFE solutions with single pJ/bit efficiencies have yet been demonstrated at data rates >40Gb/s.",

Under severe channel impairments, an ADC-based receiver with a DSP backend provides robust performance, especially for MMF applications, due to the complexity of the channel pulse response and the dynamic nature of the channel impairment. The reach of the backplane channels can also be extended, providing flexibility for system design. Applications such as 10G SFP+ DAC have less channel loss; consequently, a slicer-based binary receiver is a more viable low-power solution. This work describes the AFE of a dual-path receiver that uses both an ADC path and a slicer path for 10Gb/s multi-standard applications in 40nm CMOS.",

Though transceivers for a data rate over 25Gb/s have been reported [1-3], designing clock-generating circuits for the receiver front-end is a significant challenge. In a phase interpolator (PI) commonly used in conventional receivers for a multi-channel configuration, both the linearity and frequency characteristics of the circuit affect the interpolation accuracy since it dynamically interpolates between reference clock signals supplied from a PLL, making the design more difficult. Blind-clock ADC-based receivers [4] eliminate the need for a clock-phase-adjusting circuit, but the area and power overheads are large due to high-sampling-rate ADCs. To address these issues, we fabricate and test a 28nm CMOS blind-clock receiver that performs phase tracking by using a data interpolator (DI). We confirm error-free operation of the receiver up to 32Gb/s with power consumption of 308.4mW from a 0.9V power supply.",

        "abstract": "A decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) reconstructs the post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) pattern from the detected data sequence and subtracts it from the received signal before detecting the next symbol. Therefore, DFE's operating speed is fundamentally limited by a 1-unit-interval (UI) feedback loop that is often the critical path in high-speed designs. Partial-response DFE (prDFE) architectures push the feedback loop away from the analog front-end to the post-slicer domain by making redundant decisions, as shown in Fig. 2.8.1(a). Since distinction between post and current data requires a sequential element to prevent a race, a latch overhead exists in the critical path of many prDFE designs [1]. For a 1-tap prDFE, the design in [2] entirely eliminates the sequential element from the critical path leveraging a unique race-free property of 1-tap half-rate prDFE. However, the architecture is not extendable to larger number of taps. For a 2-tap prDFE, overhead of the sequential element is reduced in a quarter-rate architecture. Figure 2.8.1(b) shows the block diagram of a receiver front-end with a shared CTLE, half-rate slicers and a quarter-rate prDFE. The critical path in the quarter-rate implementation is limited by a 2:1 mux delay (Tmux) and a flop setup and clock-to-output overhead (TFF), as shown in Fig. 2.8.2(a). Assuming TFF = 2Tmux, the loop delay increases by 200% compared to the absolute minimum for speculation, Tmux. Figure 2.8.2(a) also shows the race that is prevented by employing the sequential elements in a quarter-rate implementation.",

This chip is a successor to the 45nm product [2], with significant improvements made to the core and nest (i.e. the logic external to the cores) in order to increase the performance and throughput of the design. Also, special considerations were necessary to ensure robust circuit operation in the high-\u03ba technology used for implementation. As seen in the die photo, the chip contains 6 processor cores (compared to 4 cores in the 45nm version), and a large shared 48MB DRAM L3 cache. Each core includes a pair of data and instruction L2 SRAM caches of 1MB each. In addition, the chip contains a memory control unit (MCU), an I/O bus controller (GX), and two sets of interfaces to the L4 cache chips (also in 32nm technology). The CP chip occupies 598 mm2, contains about 2.75B transistors, and has 1071 signal IOs.",

        "abstract": "Public-key cryptosystems (Fig. 3.3.1) have been widely developed for ensuring the security of information exchange in network communications, financial markets, private data storage, and personal identification devices. In contrast to the well-known RSA algorithm, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) provides the same security level with a shorter key size. As specified in IEEE P1363 (Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography), ECC arithmetic is required to provide not only dual-field operations over GF(p) and GF(2m) but also arbitrary elliptic curves (EC) for different requirements, such as encryption, signature, and key exchange. In this paper, a solution supporting a 521b key size is proposed to accelerate the most time-critical elliptic curve scalar multiplication (ECSM). It computes multiple points KP = P + P + ... + P, where K is the private key and P is an EC point. In addition, side-channel attack resistance is implemented to prevent information leakage from simple power-analysis (SPA), differential power-analysis (DPA) [1], zero-value point (ZVP) [2], and doubling attacks [3].",

        "abstract": "With the increasing complexity and variety of applications, programmable multi-core processors are drawing attention due to their high flexibility and low implementation cost, yet their performance and energy efficiency still cannot fulfill the demands of many compute-intensive applications. This paper describes a high-performance energy-efficient 24-core processor for multi-media and communication applications, with the following key features: (1) a packet-controlled circuit-switched double-layer network-on-chip (NoC) which provides 11Tb/s/W energy efficiency with 435Gb/s bisection-bandwidth; (2) a cluster-shared NoC-connected heterogeneous reconfigurable execution array, which can improve the performance of frequently used computations in multimedia and communication applications by over 6\u00d7; (3) memory hierarchy improvements, including a multi-page foreground and background register file, and memory splitting and sharing. The processor, implemented in TSMC 65nm CMOS LP and occupying 18.8mm2 (Fig. 3.6.7) operates at 850MHz at 1.2V, with 523mW power dissipation and 39GOPS/W (26pJ/operation) energy efficiency, which is 1.75\u00d7 better than our former 16-core processor [3].",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transfer up to the 5W power level has become a recent trend for mobile phones, which can be classified into two types: inductive type and resonant type. Inductive type usually has higher efficiency but requires short distance and precise alignment between the transmitter and receiver. From the viewpoint of convenience, resonant type has much better freedom from distance and alignment under a handicap of somewhat less efficiency. Among the numerous resonant wireless power transfer (RWPT) mechanisms, the one using 6.78MHz or 13.56MHz band for fRS has been a the mainstream option [1-2]. Major sources of power loss related to efficiency degradation are the transmitter circuits, receiver circuits, and resonant tanks of both sides. The efficiency of the receiver circuit is more important since it is especially related to the thermal emission of hands-on mobile devices and has to meet a strict value because the recent mobile phones already spend most of their thermal margins on the application processor. In this paper, we suggest a new receiver circuit for RWPT with simple structure and high efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transfer has a broad range of applications ranging from mobile phone chargers to biomedical implants. For cochlear implants [1] and retinal prostheses [2], having a miniaturized form factor and being battery-less are highly desirable. Such devices require real-time power transfer in the range of 10 to 100mW [3], and as human tissue specific absorption rate (SAR) increases with frequency, inductively-coupled power links that operate at 13.56MHz or lower in ISM bands are commonly used, as shown in Fig. 4.2.1. However, lower transmission frequency means larger matching and filtering capacitors that are bulky. In addition, the received AC input amplitude VAC,Peak would fluctuate due to changes in distance and orientation between the coupling coils. Hence, comparator- controlled power switches (active diodes) are used to replace diodes so that the rectifier could work at a lower VAC,Peak and still achieve a high voltage conversion ratio (VCR) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) [4]. In this research, we present the first fully integrated 1X/2X active rectifier in the 30mW range with all capacitors fabricated on-chip, also shown in Fig. 4.2.1. This is made possible by a switching arrangement that avoids connecting the output capacitors in series in the 2X mode. Reverse current is reduced for VAC,Peak that ranges from 1.25 to 4V by a bias current that is quasi-inversely proportional to the output DC voltage, as explained later; and efficiency is carefully measured by the insertion of a sensing resistor plus an additional capacitor to reduce distortion.",

For indoor remote sensors, amorphous silicon photovoltaic (PV) cell can be used to harvest energy from indoor lighting. Furthermore, if the power consumption of the sensor is low, e.g., the image sensor in [1], the power rating of the PV cell can be limited to tens or hundreds of microwatts to minimize the form factor of the sensor. However, as the output power of the PV cell varies greatly with illumination level [2] and the output voltage of the PV cell (VPV), an energy storage device, such as a battery, is required to regulate the harvester's output power. Furthermore, a DC-DC converter with a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is needed to lock the PV cell at its maximum power point (MPP).",

        "abstract": "Many modern mobile devices have a touchscreen and are powered by a rechargeable battery. To extend battery usage time before recharge, harvesting energy from ambient light provides an elegant solution if the photovoltaic (PV) modules can be integrated with mobile devices [1]. However, mobile devices are frequently finger operated and/or in motion, so light-harvesting should consider fast-changing shading and partial shading problems. Previous IC works [2-4] have reported on the implementation of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for light-harvesting, none of them have concurrently addressed these two problems. Although one of these works [3] considered the mobile device issue, it targets high MPPT steady-state accuracy without considering fast-changing shading problem. Hence, there is still room for improvement with respect to short MPPT transient time to harvest more energy for extending battery usage time.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting is an attractive technique to take advantage of renewable energy and make systems, such as wireless sensor nodes, less dependent on external power sources. A photovoltaic (PV) energy-harvesting charger can convert energy from solar panels to charge batteries or super capacitors. To manage the variation in illumination, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is essential to lock the output power of solar panels on the maximum power points [1, 2]. For any generic solar cell, its output current is determined by the output voltage in an exponential relation. Without knowing the characteristics of the solar cell in advance, it is necessary to monitor a feedback parameter to reach its maximum power point. Current measurement is needed at the output of the boost converter [1] or in the output path of the solar cell [2]. Motivated by the topology in [2], we propose a mixed-signal integration to avoid power hungry digital signal processing. In this paper, we report a charger with an integrated MPPT controller that can provide fast tracking for wide-range illumination levels while keeping high conversion efficiency. Also, a battery management unit is implemented and integrated on the same IC.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting is seen as an enabling technology for autonomous wireless sensing in automotive applications. This technology may rely on piezoelectric or electrostatic energy conversion using the energy available during the tire impact with the road. The power management system has to transfer harvested power to the load battery (few \u03bcW to mW) with the highest possible efficiency. An electrostatic harvester can generate voltages up to 40V even at low accelerations [1]. Hence, a high voltage (HV) DC-DC converter is needed to maximize the energy transfer from the harvester to the load battery. However, HV buck converters including maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms have been shown only for much higher ranges of power, in the order of W [2]. On the other hand, all reported converters working in the sub-mW power range are not able to sustain high input voltages and do not include an integrated MPPT algorithm [3, 4]. Until this work, no solution in literature is able to interface with these electrostatic energy harvesters. Figure 4.6.1 shows the block diagram of the system, designed and fabricated in TSMC 0.25\u03bcm BCD CMOS (60V option). The IC is able to interface a vibrational harvester by means of few external components: a rectifier, its load capacitor CIN, and an inductor L. The converter is consisting of a power train and its control circuits. The power train is implemented with the external inductor L, and the integrated power switches MP and MN. The integrated control circuits have to provide the correct gate voltages VGN and VGP for allowing the converter to maximize its output power. All circuits are biased by means of an integrated current reference and are supplied by the load battery voltage VBAT and the DC input VIN.",

        "abstract": "Because miniaturized systems store little energy, their lifespans are often short. Fortunately, vibrations are consistent and abundant in many applications, so ambient kinetic energy can be a viable source. Vibrations induce the charges in piezoelectric transducers to build electrostatic forces that damp vibrations and convert kinetic energy into the electrical domain. The shunting switches and switched-inductor circuit of bridge rectifiers in [1-2] increase this output energy by extending the damping (i.e., harvesting) duration within a vibration cycle. Because the output voltages of bridge rectifiers clamp and limit the electrical damping forces built, switched-inductor converters in [3-4], whose damping voltages can exceed their rectified outputs, draw more power from vibrations. Still, electrical-mechanical coupling factors in tiny transducers are low, so electrical damping forces (i.e., voltages) remain weak. Investing energy into the transducer can increase this force, but unlike in [5-6], which demand multiple inductors and high-voltage sources, the system presented here invests energy with only one inductor at low voltages.",

        "abstract": "In cellular receivers, out-of-band blockers are generally managed by surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) filters between the antenna and the low-noise amplifier (LNA). For Time Division Duplexing (TDD), such as GSM, the SAW can be removed if the receiver can handle very large interferers (e.g. in GSM 0dBm 20 MHz away) [1]. Generally SAW filters also perform differential to single-ended (SE) conversion (balun). Once the SAW is removed an SE transceiver eliminates the external balun, reducing cost and attenuation. For the same sensitivity, a SAW-less SE transceiver can have a noise figure (NF) 2 to 3dB higher than a classical one. An SE LNA could be susceptable to couplings from supply and substrate, which are usually rejected through symmetry. Therefore it should become symmetric as closely as possible to the input pin. A SAW-less differential transceiver [2] can also be appealing if it has an NF close to that of classical transceivers. This is because it can have better sensitivity in TDD (a balun attenuates less than a SAW) and it can be very flexible, being usable for both FDD (where duplexers are differential) and TDD.",

        "abstract": "Multi-antenna transceivers with beam-forming are recently gaining interest for low GHz frequencies (<;6GHz) [1-4]. In the antenna beam, (phase-shifted) signals from multiple antennas add constructively, improving SNR, while out-of-beam signals add destructively (i.e. spatial filtering). Usually the summation point is behind some gain blocks, which then need to be capable of handling strong signals. To improve the input-referred compression point P1dB, a fully passive switched-capacitor approach was presented in [4], providing P1dB=+2dBm, but at a high noise penalty: NF=18dB. Here we propose to sum immediately at the baseband capacitors of passive mixer-first switched-RC downconverters. We show that this can render a direction-dependent RF impedance (spatial filtering) together with RF bandpass frequency filtering at lower noise and higher P1dB.",

        "abstract": "Recent passive-mixer-based architectures, such as [1], have shown that blockers as large as 0dBm can be tolerated without excessive gain compression. However, even in a perfectly linear receiver, reciprocal mixing of the blocker with LO phase noise deposits additive noise on the wanted signal, as shown in Fig. 5.3.1. This is an inevitable limitation to any mixer-based receiver. Assuming that the blocker experiences no passive RF filtering, the noise figure of such a receiver in the presence of a given blocker is only lowered through improving the LO phase noise. To overcome this challenge, most wireless receivers use LC-oscillators that despite their superior phase noise to ring oscillators [2], still consume a large portion of the radio power. As the quality factor of on-chip resonators does not scale with technology, the phase noise of an LC-oscillator can only be improved by consuming more power, while the benefits of circuit innovation are fundamentally limited [3]. Although increasing current helps, it does come at a cost, and is ultimately limited by the maximum allowable amplitude, and how reliably small inductor values can be fabricated without Q-degradation. In this paper, we propose a mixed-signal reciprocal-mixing cancellation technique that leads to a substantial reciprocal-mixing noise figure improvement independent of the LO phase noise.",

        "abstract": "RF power amplifiers (PA) implemented in a scaled CMOS technology typically have a low maximum output power because they operate from a low supply voltage. This paper proposes an array RF PA able to deliver a large output power from a large supply voltage through the use of three techniques illustrated in Fig. 5.4.1: (1) series-parallel transformers, (2) transistor stacking, and (3) amplifier stacking. First, the array RF PA employs series-parallel combinations of transformers to provide simultaneous impedance transformation and power combining over a wide bandwidth. The integrated on-chip impedance transformation is more robust and reproducible than off-chip matching using discrete passive components. Second, stacking transistors in the array RF PA increases the output power provided by each of the unit PA stages comprising the array. Third, two PAs are stacked [1]. The two stacking methods increase the operating supply voltage, thus making possible an RF PA operating directly from a battery without the need for a DC-DC switching regulator to generate a low PA supply voltage. A prototype 2\u00d74 array RF PA with a -3dB bandwidth of 1.9GHz has been integrated in a standard 65nm CMOS technology. The array RF PA can deliver 30.3dBm (28.2dBm) of output power at 5.3GHz when operating from a 6.35V (4.8V) supply with 17.8% (20.6%) power-added efficiency (PAE).",

        "abstract": "Low-cost CMOS PAs for mobile terminals have been a focus of attention in recent years. Self-contained, linear CMOS PAs are particularly attractive for smooth replacement of conventional compound semiconductor PA products. The main challenge concerning the linear CMOS PAs is to improve their power efficiency. Doherty PAs improve the average power efficiency by means of backoff efficiency boosting; however, their applicable carrier frequency range is narrow owing to the high-order output network. Supply modulation is another technique to improve the PA back-off efficiency. Although hybrid modulators have been studied for CMOS polar transmitters [1,2], none of them have satisfied full specs of modulation bandwidth and the output power for 4G cellular applications. The area overhead is also unacceptable for application to a self-contained linear PA. A class-G supply modulator relaxes the limitations by receiving external, discrete levels of supply voltages [3]. However, it still requires a costly extra DC-DC converter for multilevel supply voltages.",

        "abstract": "RFID systems use backscattering communication in which the TX transmits a continuous wave (CW) to provide energy to the tag while the RX receives data from it. Due to the simultaneous operation of the RX and TX, large TX leakage is the main issue in securing RX sensitivity. Although external isolation components such as a circulator or directional coupler are widely used in RFID systems, TX leakage is still a dominant source of sensitivity degradation due to its finite isolation and environmentally dependent antenna reflection ratio, as shown in Fig. 5.6.1(a). In a single-antenna-based RFID system, the TX carrier leakage is typically above 0dBm at the RX input despite off-chip isolation components [1]. As can be seen in Fig. 5.6.1(b), when the close-in phase noise of the TX carrier is -85dBc/Hz, the phase noise level of 0dBm TX leakage in the receive channel reaches 89dB higher than the thermal noise level, thus directly degrading the SNR. In efforts to solve the leakage problem, leakage cancellation [2,3] and self-correlated RX [4] techniques have been reported. However, high power consumption for leakage replica generation and long calibration time, as in [2,3], and hardware complexity for a 45 degree phase shift [4] are issues that need to be resolved.",

        "abstract": "A surface electromyogram (EMG), which measures a voltage waveform produced by skeletal muscles on skin, is an important tool for applications detecting the human will of motion, such as for prosthetic hands and prosthetic legs. In the application to a prosthetic hand, a multipoint EMG measurement is required to precisely control the hand [1, 2]. Conventional multipoint measurements with a passive electrode array [1-3], however, have two problems: 1) Measurement over a long time period is annoying, because the EMG electrodes placed on the skin are rigid, and 2) the signal integrity of EMG is degraded, because the number of wires between the electrodes and the front-end circuits increases with increasing number of measurement points. To address these challenges, a surface EMG measurement sheet (SEMS) on which an EMG electrode array and a front-end amplifier array with 2V organic transistors are integrated on a 1\u03bcm-thick ultra-flexible film is developed to control prosthetic hands. The developed SEMS enables a comfortable long-time measurement without signal integrity degradation.",

        "abstract": "Organic transistors (OTFTs) can be printed on thin plastic substrates to obtain mechanically flexible large-area electronics with high throughput. Examples of applications include sensor-augmented RFIDs fabricated on the packaging of retail items and smart surfaces integrating sensors or actuators. Printed OTFTs have been used to design circuits [1-4], however, these implementations have been mainly limited to digital circuits or large-area switch matrices. A major challenge in the design of printed circuits is the relatively high variability in the characteristics of the OTFTs, which is caused by the low degree of spatial correlation typical of printing processes. A relatively high rate of hard faults is also typical in printed electronics (at the state of the art, yield is acceptable only for a circuit complexity of ~100 transistors).",

        "abstract": "Smart sensors embedded in packaging films for food or pharmaceuticals, and read out using RFID protocols, are an important future application of large-area organic electronics. The first steps towards flexible organic electronics were code generators for RFID tags [1]. To realize flexible smart sensors it is also essential to develop analog sensor interfaces and ADCs, which will enable the integration of sensors, data processing and RF communication (Fig. 6.6.1) on the same plastic foil [2]. This paper focuses on the design of an organic ADC for quasi-static signals, like the ones provided by chemical and temperature sensors. Only a few ADCs made with organic TFTs (OTFTs) have been reported [3,4] so far. Their linearity is limited by the poor matching typical of organic technologies and reached an INL of 2.6LSB at 6b resolution before calibration. This paper addresses an ADC whose linearity is not related to the matching of OTFTs or capacitances, but relies on the electrical properties of a transconductor. Even without calibration, the INL is 1LSB and the DNL is 0.6LSB at 6b resolution. The converter is manufactured in a double-gate p-type OTFT technology [5], which provides two gates to control the semiconductor channel, G and TG (Fig. 6.6.1): a voltage applied to the top gate TG produces a linearly proportional shift of the threshold voltage.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an all-digital, 1024x8, time-resolved SPAD line sensor designed for time-resolved laser Raman spectroscopy and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 6.7.1. The sensor consists of 16 groups of 64x8 SPAD arrays with fast readout interface electronics. The SPAD gate width and its delay are controlled by a combination of off-chip (Maxim DS1020, 1ns/tap) and on-chip delay lines (250ps/tap) resulting in a temporal resolution of 250ps through typical scan ranges of 32ns. Properly balanced binary trees allow less than 98.5ps skew variation across the entire chip. The proposed line sensor has a fill factor of 44.3% with a photon detection probability (PDP) of 21% at 475nm at an excess bias of 3.5V. The 24.6mm long focal plane matches the format of a typical detector that would be used at the output of a Raman spectrometer (e.g. CCD), allowing the observation of the entire Raman spectrum without the use of any moving parts, thus reducing complexity, overall power consumption, and weight.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a complete sensor interface implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made possible by using the imperfection-immune paradigm [4], which successfully overcomes major obstacles for CNFET-based circuits: mis-positioned and metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs). 44 CNFETs, each consisting of 10 to 200 CNTs depending on transistor sizing, are used to build the circuit. In contrast, earlier demonstrations of CNFET-based circuits included only small stand-alone components such as an adder sum, latch, percolation transport-based decoder, and ring oscillator on a single CNT [4]. Because it is easier to implement digital circuits using immature technologies compared to analog circuits, highly-digital sensor interfaces such as the PLL-based design in [5] are ideal implementations when using a new technology. The implemented capacitive sensor interface is based on a first-order Bang-Bang Phase-Locked Loop (BBPLL) digital architecture, which processes the sensor information entirely in the frequency domain (Fig. 6.8.1). Its funcationality is described in detail in [5].",

This requires parallel multi-channel optical transceivers each operating at 25Gb/s and beyond. Due to variations in the output power of transmitters and in some cases different optical paths the parallel receivers have to operate at different input optical power levels. This trend places increasing strain to the acceptable inter-channel crosstalk in integrated multi-channel receivers [3]. Minimizing this cross-talk penalty when all channels are operational is becoming increasingly important in ultra-high throughput optical links.",

The main power consumption of an optical link strongly depends on the sensitivity of the TIA; thus, development of a high-sensitivity TIA is a key to creating a low-power optical link., There are two challenges concerning the design of such a TIA: (1) improving the sensitivity of TIA without sacrificing bandwidth and (2) suppressing ISI due to insertion loss. To address these two issues, a 4\u00d725Gb/s CMOS optical receiver (RX), which includes a four-channel TIA and a PD array operating at 1.3\u03bcm wavelength, is developed. The key components of the TIA are an automatic-decision-threshold control (ATC) with an offset canceller and low-voltage output driver (Drv) with peaking value of 7.7dB at 12.5GHz, achieved by separating equalizer (EQ) function and output buffer (BUF). The TIA attains a sensitivity of -9.7dBm (86\u03bcApp) optical modulation amplitude (OMA) and an eye opening of 65% at 25Gb/s. Operation at 28Gb/s with sensitivity of -8.2dBm (121\u03bcApp) OMA is also confirmed.",

Figure 7.3.1 shows the architecture, where 10\u00d710Gb/s input data is serialized into 4\u00d725Gb/s bit stream by a 10:4 serializer (i.e., gearbox TX). A 4-element LDD array subsequently drives 4 laser diodes, emitting 850nm light into 4 multimode fibers (MMFs). After traveling over 100m, these optical signals are captured and transformed into electrical domain by means of photo diodes (PDs) and a TIA/LA array. A 4:10 deserializer (gear-box RX) recovers the clock and data, and restores the data sequences into 10\u00d710Gb/s outputs. In applications, gearbox TRX and optical frontends (i.e., LDD and TIA/LA arrays) may be separated by several inches in order to fulfill system-level integration.",

        "abstract": "ADC-based receivers process the received data in the digital domain, eliminating the need for much of the analog front end. In addition, a feed-forward blind architecture [1,2] eliminates the feedback loop between digital and analog domains so that the ADC and digital CDR can be designed and simulated independently. Previous works [1,2] sampled the incoming data at 2 samples per UI and at 1.45 samples per UI to achieve 5Gb/s and 6.875Gb/s, respectively. To further increase the data rate to 10Gb/s, we sample at baud rate (1 sample per UI). Existing baud-rate architectures [3] rely on a phase-tracking clock to sample at the middle of the data eye. This paper presents a blind baud-rate CDR, fabricated in 65nm CMOS. At 10Gb/s, the CDR demonstrates a high-frequency jitter tolerance of 0.19UI with \u00b1300ppm of frequency offset. Also, the CDR demonstrates successful operation with 1000ppm offset, which amounts to sub-baud-rate sampling.",

        "abstract": "Integrated photonic interconnect technology presents a disruptive alternative to electrical I/O for many VLSI applications. Superior bandwidth-density and energy-efficient operation can be realized through dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) and lower transmission losses. There are two main paths towards an integrated platform. Hybrid/heterogeneous designs [1-3] enable each component to be custom-tailored, but suffer from large packaging parasitics, increased manufacturing costs due to requisite process flows, and costly 3D integration or microbump packaging. Monolithic integration mitigates integration overheads, but has not penetrated deeply-scaled technologies due to necessary process customizations [4]. The first monolithic integration of photonic devices and electronic-photonic operation in sub-100 nm (45 nm SOI process with zero foundry changes) is demonstrated in [5]. This paper presents a monolithically integrated optical modulator with a new all-digital driver circuit in a commercial 45nm SOI process. The waveform-conditioning driver circuit enables the carrier-injection modulator to operate at 2.5Gb/s with an energy-cost of 1.23pJ/b, making it ~4\u00d7 faster and more energy-efficient than the previous monolithically integrated driver/modulator presented in [5].",

        "abstract": "The need for more bandwidth driven by streaming video and other data intensive applications has been steadily pushing the optical link speed to the 40G/100G domain. Compared to VCSEL and ring resonator, Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) is the best solution for long distance (>500m), high data rate (>28Gb/s) optical communications [1-3]. However, high power consumption, low link density and high cost seriously prevent traditional MZI from being the next generation of optical link technology. To fundamentally reduce the cost of MZI, it is highly desirable to make the process CMOS compatible with high efficiency, thus the modulation voltage, size, and power can be reduced to a level where advanced sub-1V CMOS circuits can be used as the driver. This paper presents two CMOS-MZI-based optical transmitters, NRZ or configurable PAM-N (N = 4,16), featuring 20Gb/s data rate and sub-pJ/bit modulation energy (PAM-4) using a 1V supply. The fully CMOS compatible photonic device is highly cost-effective in terms of integration, manufacturability and scalability.",

        "abstract": "Future computing systems will require increasingly high bandwidth to supply data to microprocessors, FPGAs, and other computational blocks [1,2]. Increasing data rate is a common solution, as I/O pad density is not scaling with bandwidth requirements. Copper interconnect has increasingly high loss with frequency, requiring complex, power-hungry equalization to overcome the channel response at high data rates. In contrast, optical interconnect can transport signals over long distances without complex equalization. Chip-to-chip optical interconnect will require sensitive, low-power, clocked receiver (RX) circuits that operate at high data rates. Conventional TIA-based RXs [1,2] require high power to maximize gain and minimize noise while maintaining high BW. A low-noise, low-BW, low-power TIA is combined with a 2-tap DFE to achieve high sensitivity in [3], but the data rate is 4Gb/s and limited dynamic range is demonstrated. Double-sampling architectures eliminate the TIA, replacing it with a large resistor [4] or a capacitive integrator [5], which decreases the front-end BW. The BW is equalized by double sampling, which is equivalent to a 2-tap FFE. However, the use of small sampling capacitors in [4,5] adds kT/C noise, limiting sensitivity. In this work, we demonstrate an optical RX with a large input resistance to maximize gain and sensitivity, while DFE with IIR feedback (DFE-IIR) [6] eliminates the resulting ISI with minimal added noise.",

        "abstract": "The vastly under-utilized spectrum in the sub-THz frequency range enables disruptive applications including 10Gb/s chip-to-chip wireless communications and imaging/spectroscopy. Owing to aggressive scaling in feature size and device fT/fmax, nanoscale CMOS technology potentially enables integration of sophisticated systems at this frequency range. For example, CMOS sub-THz signal sources and TRXs have been reported [1-4], employing techniques such as distributed active radiator (DAR) and super-harmonic signal generator. The lack of RF amplification in CMOS sub-THz TRXs reported in prior work, however, results in low efficiency (and thus higher power dissipation), and high noise-figure (NF). This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating a 210GHz TRX with on-off-keying (OOK) modulation incorporating a 2\u00d72 TX antenna array, a 2\u00d72 spatial combining power amplifier (PA), a fundamental frequency VCO, and a low noise amplifier (LNA) in a 32nm SOI CMOS process (fT/fmax=250/350GHz).",

        "abstract": "Terahertz spectroscopy using silicon technology is gaining attraction for future portable and affordable material identification equipment. To do this, a broadband THz radiation source is critical. Unfortunately, the bandwidth of the prior CMOS works is not sufficient. In [1], the 300GHz signal source achieves 4.5% tuning range by changing the coupling among multiple oscillators. In [2], the DAR array has 3% tuning range with radiation capability. Alternative to the continuous device-tuning method, THz time-domain spectroscopy utilizing the broadband spectrum of picosecond pulses is widely used in the optics community [3]. In this paper, a high-power pulse-based sub-millimeter-Wave radiation source using 65nm bulk CMOS technology is reported. The architecture of this transmitter is shown in Fig. 8.2.1, where four differential core oscillator pairs are mutually coupled through four quadrature oscillators. Each core oscillator pair generates 2nd-harmonic signals at 260GHz that are power-combined after radiating through eight on-chip antennas. Four shunt switches, controlled by narrow pulses (width\u224845ps) modulate the radiation. The pulses are generated by local digital circuit blocks with programmable repetition rate up to 5GHz. This way, the broadband spectrum of the pulses is upconverted to the carrier frequency of 260GHz. Without modulation, the chip achieves a continuous-wave radiated power of 1.1mW. Under modulation, the measured bandwidth of the source is 24.7GHz, which makes it suitable for many FTIR-based THz spectrometers. In addition, if the switches are modulated by digital data, this chip can also be used as a transmitter for sub-millimeter/THz wireless communications.",

Signal amplification for the target THz and high mm-Wave applications entails daunting design challenges, as operation frequency is getting closer to the Maximum Oscillation Frequency (fmax) of the transistors. This is mostly because the maximum available gain (Gma) drops significantly below useful levels at frequencies close to fmax. In this paper we introduce an amplifier that can boost the gain of the transistors close to the maximum fundamental value and achieves 9.2dB of gain and -3.5dBm of saturated output power at around 260GHz.",

This paper extends the capability of an imaging array receiver by improving image resolution using the novel concept of spatial-overlapping sub-arrays and enhancing image capture time using a phased-array within an imaging array receiver (RX). Specifically, the design and implementation of a BiCMOS 9-element array RX consisting of four 2\u00d72 overlapping sub-arrays is presented. The RF-path-sharing between neighboring sub-arrays leads to a reduction in the chip area by 40% as compared to a conventional imaging array consisting of four 2\u00d72 non-overlapping sub-arrays, while improving the RX's spatial resolution due to the higher sub-array density. Each 2\u00d72 sub-array in this imaging array RX forms a pixel (Fig. 8.5.1).",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-Wave and sub-THz imaging sensors have been demonstrated in CMOS technology recently. Mechanical scanners are still required to capture the whole image, making the systems bulky and costly. The limited resolution of the third-dimension (z-direction) also leads to a vague 3D picture. Other 2D solutions need not only focal lens, but large chip area to accommodate more pixels. This paper presents a 94GHz 3D image radar with electronic scanning. Using a 4TX/4RX beamforming technique and a modulated time-of-flight (ToF) algorithm, this prototype achieves \u00b128\u00b0 scanning range, 2m maximum distance, and 1mm depth resolution with 960mW of power.",

        "abstract": "The continued scaling of digital CMOS technology has enabled mm-Wave VCOs with record figures of merit [1-5]. This is mainly driven by the increase in cutoff frequency and decrease in power consumption brought by lower supply voltages. However, at mm-Wave, challenges such as low Q-factor of the tuning varactors and switched capacitors result in a sharp degradation in the resonator Q. For an NMOS LC-VCO (Fig. 8.8.1), a large bias current and high transconductance (gm) are needed to maintain a given oscillation amplitude and to satisfy the startup condition. Since gm has a weak dependency on current in strong inversion, it can primarily be increased by enlarging the device width, W1, as illustrated in Fig. 8.8.2. Further degradation in the device gm is experienced when the VCO operates near the transistor cutoff frequency, necessitating an even larger W1 (Fig. 8.8.2). This results in a large fixed capacitance Cfix1 and hence a limited VCO tuning range (TR) [1,2]. It can also be shown that for the same bias current (i.e. output swing), increasing W1 comes at the expense of large thermal (1/f2) noise. This can be illustrated by examining the excess noise factor F, defined as the ratio between the transistors' switching noise and the tank resistor noise [6]. As depicted in Fig. 8.8.2, an extra 5dB of 1/f2 noise is added to the VCO output when the transistor W1 is increased from 20\u03bcm to 60\u03bcm, which is required to meet a 2\u00d7 startup margin. Moreover, increasing W1 leads to a higher contribution of 1/f3 noise from up-converted 1/f noise [7].",

The essential driving force behind these ubiquitous devices is the high-performance CPU. To satisfy ever growing consumer demand for higher performance, a high-speed and multicore CPU configuration is mandatory, while energy efficiency is equally important for longer battery life. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of performance (compute-intensive tasks, as well as less intensive tasks) required by today's mobile devices, a heterogeneous dual-CPU configuration comprising a high-performance CPU and an energy-efficient CPU can be one of the most energy efficient solutions for accomplishing both high-intensity and low-intensity tasks.",

        "abstract": "The increase in the use and number of smartphone devices is causing heavy data traffic volumes on existing 3G mobile wireless networks. LTE, often referred to as 4G, offers true mobile broadband. It is a new network and access technology that provides new spectrum resources, much increased spectral efficiency, higher throughputs (150Mb/s with higher rates to come), at lower latency and it uses an IP-based infrastructure. LTE is the solution to mitigate the traffic load issue and it is being rolled out around the world. The proposed communication processor R-Mobile U2 (RMU2) achieves single-chip integration of a 1.5GHz dual-core application processor and a triple mode (GSM/WCDMA/LTE) base-band processor. Key design highlights of the RMU2 are: 1) A 28nm HKMG high-performance and low-leakage (HPL) CMOS bulk process achieves an optimal balance between both low leakage current and high performance. 2) A CPU clock control mechanism, called the \u201cpower saver\u201d, limits the CPU power so as not to exceed a threshold level and to reduce IR drop. 3) The internal power domain is separated into 33 sub-blocks with I/O NMOS power switches [1] to minimize leakage current of any unused sub-block. 4) A dual-mode low-leakage SRAM [2] achieves low standby current in addition to conventional memory characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The latest video coding standard High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [1] provides 50% improvement in coding efficiency compared to H.264/AVC, to meet the rising demand for video streaming, better video quality and higher resolutions. The coding gain is achieved using more complex tools such as larger and variable-size coding units (CU) in a hierarchical structure, larger transforms and longer interpolation filters. This paper presents an integrated circuit which supports Quad Full HD (QFHD, 3840\u00d72160) video decoding for the HEVC draft standard. It addresses new design challenges for HEVC (\u201cH.265\u201d) with three primary contributions: 1) a system pipelining scheme which adapts to the variable-size largest coding unit (LCU) and provides a two-stage sub-pipeline for memory optimization; 2) unified processing engines to address the hierarchical coding structure and many prediction and transform block sizes in area-efficient ways; 3) a motion compensation (MC) cache which reduces DRAM bandwidth for the LCU and meets the high throughput requirements which are due to the long filters.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a power-efficient speeded-up robust features (SURF) extraction accelerator targeted primarily for micro air vehicles (MAVs) with autonomous navigation (Fig. 9.7.1). Typical object recognition SoCs [4-6] employ an application-specific algorithm to choose specific regions of interest (ROIs) to reduce computation by focusing on a small portion of the image. However, this approach is not feasible in applications where the whole image must be analyzed, such as visual navigation that requires the extraction of general features to determine location or movement. In addition, multicore architectures need to run at high clock frequencies to meet high peak performance requirements and the power consumption of inter-core communication becomes prohibitive. Since feature extraction algorithms require significant memory accesses across a large area, parallelization in a multicore system requires costly high-bandwidth memories for massive intermediate data.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition processors have been reported for the applications of autonomic vehicle navigation, smart surveillance and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) [1-3]. Most of the processors adopt a single classifier rather than multiple classifiers even though multi-classifier systems (MCSs) offer more accurate recognition with higher robustness [4]. In addition, MCSs can incorporate the human vision system (HVS) recognition architecture to reduce computational requirements and enhance recognition accuracy. For example, HMAX models the exact hierarchical architecture of the HVS for improved recognition accuracy [5]. Compared with SIFT, known to have the best recognition accuracy based on local features extracted from the object [6], HMAX can recognize an object based on global features by template matching and a maximum-pooling operation without feature segmentation. In this paper we present a multi-classifier many-core processor combining the HMAX and SIFT approaches on a single chip. Through the combined approach, the system can: 1) pay attention to the target object directly with global context consideration, including complicated background or camouflaging obstacles, 2) utilize the super-resolution algorithm to recognize highly blurred or small size objects, and 3) recognize more than 200 objects in real-time by context-aware feature matching.",

        "abstract": "Radio receivers should be robust to large out-of-band blockers with small degradation in their sensitivity. N-path mixers can be used as mixer-first receivers [1] with good linearity and RF filtering [2]. However, 1/f noise calls for large active device sizes for IF circuits and high power consumption. The 1/f noise issue can be relaxed by having RF gain. However, to avoid desensitization by large out-of-band blockers, a bandpass filter (BPF) with sharp cut-off frequency is required in front of the RF amplifiers. gm-C BPFs suffer from tight tradeoffs among DR, power consumption, Q and fc. Also, on-chip Q-enhanced LC BPFs [3] are not suitable due to low DR, large area and non-tunability. Therefore, bulky and non-tunable SAW filters are used. N-path BPFs offer high Q while their center frequency is tuned by the clock frequency [2]. Compared to gm-C filters, this technique decouples the required Q from the DR. The 4-path filter in [4] has only 2nd-order filtering and limited rejection. The order and rejection of N-path BPFs can be increased by cascading [5], but this renders a \u201cround\u201d passband shape. The 4th-order 4-path BPF in [6] has a \u201cflat\u201d passband shape and high rejection but a high NF. This work solves the noise issue of [6] while achieving the same out-of-band linearity and adding 25dB of voltage gain to relax the noise requirement of the subsequent stages.",

        "abstract": "Capacitively coupled chopper amplifiers are capable of handling common-mode voltages outside their supply rails, while also achieving high power efficiency and low offset [1-3]. However, a significant drawback of such amplifiers is a transfer-function notch around the chopping frequency (fchop). This is because their input choppers demodulate signals near fchop to DC, where they are blocked by the input capacitors. This problem is exacerbated by the use of a ripple-reduction loop (RRL) to suppress chopper ripple, which also creates a notch at fchop, and, moreover, can take up to 1ms to settle. The net result is an amplifier with a transfer-function notch and a step response that is accompanied by a slowly-decaying burst of chopper ripple [1]. To solve these problems, a multi-path capacitively-coupled chopper-stabilized operational amplifier (MCCOPA) is proposed. Implemented in a HV CMOS 0.7\u03bcm technology, it has a smooth transfer function and achieves a 20V common-mode voltage range (CMVR), 3\u03bcV offset and 148dB DC CMRR while drawing only 8\u03bcA from a 5V supply.",

        "abstract": "Integrated low-frequency oscillators can replace crystal oscillators as sleep-mode timers to reduce the size and cost of wireless sensors [1]. Since the timer is one of the few continuously functioning circuits, minimizing its power consumption can greatly reduce sleep-mode power of highly duty-cycled systems. Temperature stability of the oscillator is important in order to minimize timing uncertainly and guard time for the radios, and thus maximizing sleep time. The voltage-averaging feedback method described in [2] achieves high stability in the MHz frequencies, but when scaled to the kHz range, requires very large filters. On the other extreme, gate leakage-based timers have been designed for sub-nW power consumption, but operate in the sub-Hz frequencies [3]. In the past, high accuracy RC oscillators in the kHz range have been designed with feed-forward correction [1] and self-chopped operation [4]. In this work, an offset cancellation architecture achieves long-term frequency stability and temperature stability while operating at lower power.",

        "abstract": "Emerging demands on ultra-low-power wireless sensor platform have presented challenges for nano-watt design of various circuit components. Clock management unit, as an essential block, is one of the most actively researched blocks. It is required to distribute various frequency ranges for energy-optimal operation, e.g., Hz for internal timer [1], kHz for global clock [2], and MHz for fast data transmission or intensive signal processing [3]. However, free-running oscillators are seriously affected by process variations and should be readjusted by post-fabrication trimming. Though a crystal gives a stable frequency, the use of multiple crystals is generally not allowed by limited form-factor and increased cost. Instead, frequency multiplication from one clean reference is more effective way for higher frequency generation. Considering high-frequency clock is only intermittently used in sensor applications, the clock multiplier should provide a fast settling when turned on as well as low-power dissipation. This paper presents a 423nW, 3.2 MHz all-digital multiplying DLL (MDLL) with a digitally controlled leakage-based oscillator (DCLO) and a fast frequency relocking scheme adaptive to the amount of frequency drift during sleep state, which is required for intermittent operation of sensor node platforms.",

To enable these scenarios, energy processing must happen in parallel with information processing. This work makes the following contributions: 1) the design of a nonvolatile D flip-flop (NVDFF) with embedded ferroelectric capacitors (fecaps) that senses data robustly and avoids race conditions; 2) the integration of the NVDFF into the ASIC design flow with a power management unit (PMU) and a simple one-bit interface to brown-out detection circuitry; and 3) a characterization of the NVDFF statistical signal margin and the energy cost of retaining data.",

        "abstract": "Nonvolatile logic-in-memory (NV-LIM) architecture [1], where magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices [2] are distributed over a CMOS logic-circuit plane, has the potential of overcoming the serious power-consumption problem that has rapidly become a dominant constraint on the performance improvement of today's VLSI processors. Normally-off and instant-on capabilities with a small area penalty due to non-volatility and three-dimensional-stackability of MTJ devices in the above structure allow us to apply a power-gating technique in a fine temporal granularity, which can perfectly eliminate wasted power dissipation due to leakage current. The impact of embedding nonvolatile memory devices into a logic circuit was, however, demonstrated by using only small fabricated primitive logic-circuit elements [3], memory-like structures such as FPGA [4], or circuit simulation because of the lack of an established MTJ-oriented design flow reflecting the chip-fabrication environment, while larger-capacity and/or high-speed-access MRAM has been increasingly developed. In this paper, we present an MTJ/MOS-hybrid video coding hardware that uses a cycle-based power-gating technique for a practical-scale MTJ-based NV-LIM LSI, which is fully designed using the established semi-automated MTJ-oriented design flow.",

The poor intrinsic stability of such devices has led to the development of very high performance temperature sensors to reach TCXO-level frequency stability [5]. One of the true advantages of the technology is the fact that well-proven semiconductor manufacturing technologies amenable for high volume production can be leveraged to produce wafer-level encapsulated low-cost components. This paper explores how XTAL resonators could benefit from similar wafer level, vacuum sealing packaging technologies with the demonstration of a generic versatile timing module.",

        "abstract": "As silicon chip performance continues to increase, the interconnection capabilities should also be improved to achieve higher overall system performance. This paper proposes a new, small-size and high-speed non-contact interconnect between printed circuit boards (PCBs) using a vertical directional coupler (VDC), which has actually been applied to a liquid crystal display (LCD) driver board. The feasibility of a millimeter-range non-contact interface using a directional coupler was studied previously [1]. In this paper, two signal ports have been implemented in one coupler by best utilizing the characteristics of VDC. The coupler size is 5mm \u00d7 2.25mm, and the gap between the couplers is about 75\u03bcm, which corresponds to the twofold thickness of a soldering resist on PCB and the adhesive material in between. The transmitter transforms the data sequence from Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) into pulses in order to reduce the level of DC components. This achieves a power saving of 1.47pJ/b, and the pulses are sent to the coupler in differential mode to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI). The measured speed was 4.6Gb/s per coupler to achieve the MIPI's maximum speed of 6Gb/s with two couplers. Conventional connectors have housings to protect contact elements or to provide mechanical support for plug-in and out. However, these housings make it difficult to achieve the smallest possible systems because they require extra space. In addition, they sometimes make the PCB trace longer, which deteriorates the maximum data rate. The method we have developed involves delineating VDC on PCB or a flexible printed circuit (FPC) to connect boards without housings and with the minimum distance. As a result, this interconnect scheme is advantageous not only because it saves space but also because it makes it easier to build systems, even those that contain a large number of built-in connectors. Thus, the proposed non-contact interconnect is suitable for future small-si- e systems.",

        "abstract": "Recently, short distance board-to-board interconnections are widely employed in portable systems and wearable devices to accommodate many components into an extremely tight footprint. In particular, portable devices such as smart phone and tablet require over 1Gb/s data transfer through ~1mm distance between AP board and a high resolution wide screen display board. Most of display interfaces are implemented with wire-line F-PCB connector, but, they suffer from: 1) high manufacturing cost, 2) the large form factor of the connector and standard socket and 3) large capacitance values of the connector and socket degrading the channel characteristics. So far, various communication interfaces have been tried to realize low cost, small form factor and low energy operation, but with limited success. The bi-phase pule modulation was used in board-to-board communication rather than base-band transmission due to its low energy operation [1-5]. This method used the positive pulse current for data `1' and the negative pulse current for data `0', and the receiver recovered the data by sampling the data at the exact time, which requires an accurate delay control unit. However, the bi-phase pulse modulation consumes significant power because: 1) current pulses sampled at every data consume large current in TX, and 2) a power hungry delay control unit is required to exactly control the sampling time.",

        "abstract": "Advances in sensor design have made ambulatory health monitoring possible and have created the need for low-power communication systems to replace bulkier traditional links. Micropower sensors should also be powered by a non-local energy source for system miniaturization and long life. Recently proposed communication systems using wireless body area networks [1,2] and body-coupled communication [3] suffer from high path loss around the human body for efficient remote power delivery. In contrast, eTextiles are becoming an increasingly popular technology for efficiently powering and communicating with such sensors [4-6] due to wide coverage around the human body combined with low path loss and comfort of use.",

        "abstract": "Memory cards are widely used in electronic systems to expand internal storage area or are used as detachable media to carry data. Although cloud computing has recently drawn attention, data transfer consumes significant power (e.g., 1% battery charge of a smartphone when 10 pictures are transferred through WLAN), making local memory card storage still attractive in mobile devices. As storage capacity increases, the I/O speed should also increase accordingly. However, conventional memory cards require strong ESD protection, limiting high-speed data transfer. A non-contact memory card [1] is one of the solutions to this problem. No signal terminals are exposed for mechanical contact, which relaxes ESD constraints. A data transfer rate of 6Gb/s/ch by inductive coupling [1] and 12Gb/s/ch by transmission-line coupling [2] are reported. The post-UHS-II speed over 5Gb/s can be covered with around 10mW power consumption. Moreover, by supplying power wirelessly, mechanical connections can be completely removed, which could provide features such as waterproof capability or a new attach-remove user interface. A >50% high-efficient wireless power delivery has been reported [3]. However, it mainly supplies a large amount of active power, and the efficiency drops to ~10% in low-power standby mode. Shutting down the power delivery in standby would require a power-on sequence and an unacceptably long suspend (~10s) for each new command. For high-speed card access, the power delivery and the wireless data receiver (RX) should always be active, consuming about 2mW in RX and in total 20mW including loss in the wireless power delivery. This standby power is almost identical to that of typical smartphones, tablet-PCs, or camcorders and the battery life halves.",

        "abstract": "Resistive RAM (ReRAM) has been recently developed for applications that require higher speed and lower voltage than Flash memory is able to provide. One of the applications is micro-controller units (MCUs) or SoCs with several megabits of embedded ReRAM. Another is solid-state drives (SSDs) where a combination of higher-density ReRAM and NAND flash memory would achieve high-performance and high-reliability storage [1], suitable for server applications for future cloud computing. ReRAM is attractive for several reasons. First, it operates at high speed and low voltage. Second, it enables high density due to the simple structure of the resistive element (RE) [2]. Third, it is immune to external environment such as magnetic fields or radiation, since the resistive switching is based on the redox reaction [3].",

        "abstract": "To satisfy the demand of higher storage density, storing multiple-bits-per-cell technique is widely adopted. As presented in [1], a 4b/cell Flash memory by using error-detection (ED) scheme stores 2b data on two sides of a memory cell individually. Since the noise margin becomes smaller, the distribution drifts due to program disturb, data retention and temperature variation will cause higher raw bit-error-rate (RBER) if the sensing level (voltage) are not adjusted accordingly. The ED scheme can detect the drift direction by counting and storing the number of cells (Ni) with threshold voltage (VTH) below the ith sensing level (VREF i). A simple example with page size 1KB is demonstrated in Fig. 12.7.1. During a read operation, the number of cells (Ni, measured) whose VTH below VREF i is counted and compared to Ni. The ED scheme can find out a sub-optimal sensing level when Ni, measured and Ni is close enough. In this paper, a production 16Gb 45nm 4b/cell ONO-based charge-trapping (CT) Flash memory is demonstrated to achieve 6b/cell capability. Since the adjacent distributions for 6b/cell are much closer to each other, even a BCH code with ED scheme fails to correct all the patterns. However, by using a new 1-3-3 mapping and LDPC codes with a developed drift-immune soft-sensing (DI-SS) engine, the 45nm 4b/cell CT Flash memory is boosted to 6b/cell. The data flow of programming data is also shown in Fig. 12.7.1.",

        "abstract": "Spin-transfer-torque (STT) MRAM is considered as a good candidate for next-generation memory that can replace Flash, SRAM and DRAM as well. As a replacement of SRAM or DRAM, write endurance more than 1012 cycles is required. However, due to limitation in the reliability of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the required endurance may not be achieved if the MTJ is overstressed by the write voltage. In this paper, a new write-path design with wire-resistance-balance scheme is presented that minimizes the voltage stress on MTJ during write operation for cells near the write buffer. Simulation shows the voltage across MTJ becomes more uniform for cells from top to bottom of array. This new scheme is implemented into 1Mb MRAM test-chip and is fabricated in TSMC 40nm low-power process. Cycling testing shows that write endurance can be improved as compared to the previous design.",

        "abstract": "A 60GHz short-range wireless system offers new opportunities for achieving wireless high-definition video links and multi-Gb/s wireless data transfer. Recent works have realized a 60GHz transceiver by means of a cost-effective CMOS process [1-3], but using a 60GHz system in mobile terminals poses the difficult challenge of achieving low power consumption as well as small form factor. The publication [3] achieves a power consumption of less than 756mW, but uses a simple MAC protocol incompatible with global standards and also suffers from a limited distance of less than 4cm. This paper presents a fully integrated transceiver chipset based on WiGig/IEEE802.11ad standards targeting mobile usage. The chipset is developed for a single-carrier (SC) modulation, which is suitable for reduced power consumption as compared to using OFDM modulation. However, the SC modulation is sensitive to in-band amplitude variation, mainly made worse by the gain variation of analog circuits and multipath delay spread. In order to compensate for those gain variations, the proposed chipset employs built-in TX in-band calibration and an RX frequency domain equalizer (FDE). The proposed techniques can relax the requirement for high speed analog circuits, leading to less power consumption while minimizing the increase of hardware size.",

        "abstract": "With fast-growing demand for high-speed mobile communications and highly saturated spectral usage below 10GHz, mm-Wave frequency bands are emerging as the key playground for future high-data-rate wireless standards. Recent years have witnessed vast technology development on V-band (60GHz) Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and E-band (80GHz) point-to-point cellular backhauls. However, existing integrated CMOS mm-Wave solutions have relatively poor energy efficiency, especially for the transmitter (TX). This is mainly due to the use of traditional Class-A Power Amplifiers (PAs) that provide good linearity but suffer from low efficiency. In addition, the efficiency of Class-A PAs drop dramatically at power back-offs, making these transmitters even less efficient when conveying non-constant envelope signals. State-of-the-art mm-Wave Class-A PAs show less than 5% efficiency at 6dB back-off [1,2].",

        "abstract": "The 60GHz band has gained great interest as an enabler for multi-Gb/s wireless links. Recent efforts [1-4] have focused on reducing transceiver power to drive adoption of 60GHz in mobile devices. To further accelerate this adoption, the cost of current mm-Wave solutions should also be reduced. Especially for short range designs (<;1m), overall cost may be dominated by packaging and testing. This paper therefore presents a low-power 60GHz CMOS 4-element phased-array QPSK transceiver with integrated slot-loop antennas. Utilizing such antennas as well as circuit stacking techniques, the transceiver achieves 10.4Gb/s with a range of >40cm in all directions while consuming only 115mW (TX+RX).",

Mixed-signal basebands have therefore been proposed and demonstrated [2] as an energy efficient (~50mW) solution for sample rates of up to 5GS/s. However, such mixed-signal designs have so far been incapable of handling non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels with pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) and extended channel delay spreads of >10ns.

        "abstract": "Radar imaging is gaining interest for medical, security, and industrial applications. Enabled by the advances in silicon technologies, a clear trend towards higher integration is observed [1-3]. Early-stage breast cancer detection is a promising application for radar imaging, as first clinical trials with patients have been carried out [4]. Commercial VNAs have been used in these experiments, but custom hardware is needed to improve the sensitivity, and to decrease the size and the cost of the setup [4]. Medical radar imaging sets great challenges. The radiation must be coupled into the body, while the skin acts as a shield. The waves that penetrate beyond the skin are heavily attenuated (>80dB for a few centimeters at 10GHz [4]). Tumor cells have different electrical properties than the healthy tissue, thus reflecting the waves and allowing for detection; this contrast is frequency dependent, decreasing at higher frequencies. These fundamental limits result in a radar requiring a dynamic range in excess to 100dB [4], and force operation in the lower-GHz range. In contrast, mm-Waves would be preferred to achieve higher resolution [1]. Ultra-wideband radars combine larger scattered energy collected at lower frequencies (thus higher SNR), and mm-range resolution, since the resolution is set by the overall bandwidth and the antenna array arrangement [2].",

        "abstract": "Intelligent environments significantly impact human daily lives through embedded sensing and actuating systems. Wireless sensors that can provide non-contact radio information are indispensable. Impulse radar is positioned as a favorable candidate in monitoring and sensing objects [1-3]. The impulse radio is inherently multipath immune and suitable for precision ranging. Accurately detecting signals with low power impulse radios imposes design challenges to impulse radar receivers. In this work, a direct-sampling receiver is proposed and implemented for an impulse radar system. It can support GHz instantaneous bandwidth and more than 100GS/sec equivalent sampling rate through the high-speed sampling circuits and on-chip timing circuitry. The wide bandwidth scattering time-domain waveforms in the radio interaction between the object and radar can be sampled and digitized by the receiver. It achieves precise measurement of time of arrival (TOA) in a radar system and expands the scalability towards antenna arrays for detection of direction of arrival (DOA) [4].",

        "abstract": "The evolution of direct-to-home transmit/receive systems requires a solution to aggregate, switch and route signals from multiple satellites to multiple set-top boxes efficiently. Prior solutions required separate coax cables to carry signals from each low-noise block (LNB) to set-top boxes in the home, resulting in high installation cost. An existing solution called analog single-wire multiswitch (ASWM) channel stacking uses an analog frequency translation switch located near the antenna LNB to select and output signals from multiple LNB's to a fixed frequency slot for each set-top box on a single cable [1]. Although the ASWM solution solves the problem of multiple cables, it does not provide enough flexibility and capability to increase the number of inputs, and it requires multiple external components like SAW filters which in turn would significantly increase cost [2]. This paper introduces an integrated digital single-wire multiswitch (DSWM) channel-stacking IC implemented in 45nm CMOS, which uses digital signal processing after wideband 9b 1.82GS/s ADC's to select and reorder transponder channels. The selected and reordered channels are digitally upconverted and are stacked into L-band through a 9b 5.46GS/s DAC. It removes the need of in-band SAW filters, offers a full flexibility of channel selection, and supports many more satellites through a single L-band cable to set-top boxes at much lower cost and lower power consumption.",

        "abstract": "For modern SoC systems, stringent requirements on on-chip clock generators include low area, low power consumption, environmental insensitivity, and the lowest possible jitter performance. Multiplying Delay-Locked Loop (MDLL) [1-2], subharmonically injection-locked techniques [3], and sub-sampling techniques [4-5] can significantly improve the random jitter characteristics of a clock generator. However, in order to guarantee their correct operation and optimal performance over process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations, each method requires additional calibration circuits, which impose difficult-to-meet timing constraints. In the case of an injection-locked PLL (IL-PLL), a free-running frequency calibration is required. However, the output of an injection-locked oscillator is always fixed at the desired frequency, so a shift in the free-running frequency (e.g. caused by temperature and voltage variations) cannot be simply compensated for by using a frequency-locked loop (FLL). Therefore, we propose the use of a dual-loop topology with one free-running voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) as a replica VCO placed inside a FLL for tracking temperature and voltage drift. The other VCO (the main VCO) is injection locked for producing a low-jitter clock, while the free-running frequency shift can be compensated for by the replica loop. The method provides robust output over temperature and voltage variations.",

A low integrated jitter is required for good display quality. However, an extremely low input frequency coming from the horizontal synchronization signal (HSYNC) makes it difficult to achieve good jitter performance, because noise from the VCO cannot be sufficiently removed due to the limited loop bandwidth. In this work, a dual-loop architecture is adopted to reduce the phase noise from the VCO based on a ring oscillator. Prior work [1] proposed a dual-loop hybrid PLL composed of an analog loop for the DCO and the digital main loop.

        "abstract": "Recent innovations in semiconductor processes have accelerated the transition from analog circuits to their digital counterparts, with digital PLLs (DPLLs) being an example of this trend [1]. All-digital or fully synthesizable approaches, which exploit the merits of advanced processes, suffer from poor noise performance and high power consumption [2]. On the other hand, hybrid approaches, which employ analog components such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs), digital-to-time converters, phase interpolators (PIs) and regulators, have the typical difficulties associated with analog circuits, such as low output resistance, small voltage headroom and large variation. In this paper, we propose a highly digital architecture for a DPLL - one which minimizes the design effort typically required for analog circuits. The power and area-consuming circuits in prior works are replaced by power and area-efficient circuits with competitive performance. For example, a conventional time-to-digital converter (TDC) usually occupies considerable chip area in order to maximize input dynamic range with precise resolution [1]. Instead, in this work, a time-windowed phase-to-digital converter using interpolated DCO phases as a phase reference is adopted. In addition, conventional synchronous counters in the feedback path drastically increase the power consumption. Furthermore, retiming of data from the TDC is unavoidable due to the meta-stability of the sampling flip-flops [1]. The proposed divider scheme, which is composed of a multi-modulus frequency divider and a dead-zone-free phase and frequency detector (PFD), eliminates the need for a synchronous counter and retiming circuits. A calibration-free \u0394\u03a3 modulator (DSM) noise canceller is also included.",

        "abstract": "Modern mobile platforms utilize power cycling to lower power dissipation and increase battery life. By turning off the circuits that are not in use, power cycling provides a viable means to make power dissipation proportional to workload, hence achieving energy proportional operation. The effectiveness of this approach is governed by the turn on/off times, off-state power dissipation, and energy overhead due to power-cycling. Ideally, the circuits must turn on/off in zero time, consume no off-state power, and incur minimal energy overhead during on-to-off and off-to-on transitions. Conventional clock multipliers implemented using phase-locked loops (PLLs) present the biggest bottleneck in achieving these performance goals due to their long locking times. Even if the PLL is frequency locked, the slow phase acquisition process limits the power-on time [1-2]. Techniques such as dynamic phase-error compensation [3], edge-missing compensation [4], and hybrid PLLs [5] improve the phase acquisition time to at best few hundred reference cycles. However, such improvements are inadequate to make best use of power-cycling. Multiplying injection-locked oscillators (MILO) are shown to lock faster than PLLs, but suffer from conflicting requirements on injection strength to simultaneously achieve low jitter and fast locking. Increasing the injection strength extends lock range and reduces locking time, but severely degrades the deterministic jitter performance [6]. In view of these drawbacks, we propose a highly digital clock multiplier that seeks to achieve low jitter, fast locking, and near-zero off-state power. By using a highly scalable digital architecture with accurate frequency presetting and instantaneous phase acquisition, the prototype 8\u00d7/16\u00d7 clock multiplier achieves 10ns (3 reference cycles) power-on time, 2psrms long-term absolute jitter, less than 25\u03bcW off-state power, 12pJ energy overhead for on/off transition, and 2.2mW on-state - ower at 2.5GHz output frequency.",

        "abstract": "Clock distribution with low skew, low jitter, and low power for high-performance microprocessors is a significant design challenge. Although traditional H-tree clock distribution circuits are widely used, the clock skew of such circuits is increased by the PVT variations associated with device scaling [1]. In recent years, there has thus been a growing interest in resonant clock distribution schemes for reduced clock skew. In particular, coupled ring oscillators with shorted outputs [2] can reduce skew and jitter without additional layout area compared to LC resonators [3]. The difference in phase and frequency of each oscillator (due to PVT variations) is equalized by the mutual connection between the oscillators. Power dissipation can also be reduced, as the enhanced variability tolerance may permit operation at lower voltages.",

        "abstract": "Technology scaling and many-core design trends demand detailed information regarding the spatial temperature distribution, which is essential for dynamic thermal management [1,2]. The number of on-chip temperature sensors in high-performance processors is increasing, with state-of-the-art commercial processors embedding up to 44 on-chip sensors [3] and the number is likely to increase in the future (Fig. 14.7.1(a)). We observe two significant challenges in on-chip temperature sensing: 1) the increasing number of sensors, and 2) placing them in a regular manner (not solely on the potential hotspots). The number of sensors is mostly constrained by their area. Indeed, the sensor area is difficult to shrink since large delay lines or a BJT with a large ADC, and digital circuits are required to generate a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) signal [2,5,6]. Many-core processor architectures give rise to the second challenge, namely, the hotspot locations within many-core processors are difficult to predict since we cannot determine the task allocation (and heat) profile at design time [2]. Consequently, an area-efficient dense thermal monitoring technique is desirable for next-generation processors.",

        "abstract": "Data communication between local system blocks through on-chip global interconnects presents significant design challenges in scaled VLSI systems. The goal of this research is to reduce the energy consumed per bit transmitted, while achieving Gb/s data rates over interconnect lengths up to 10mm. Voltage-mode signaling with capacitive boosting [1-2] has been proposed for low-power on-chip interconnects. To increase the data rate over RC-limited interconnect, aggressive equalization schemes should be used in receivers [1-3] and transmitters [1-2] at the cost of significant power consumption. As an alternative to voltage-mode signaling, current-mode signaling has been considered. It was originally used for fast bitline sensing in memory [4-5] to take inherent advantage of a reduced RC time constant. However, prior work on current-mode transceivers for on-chip interconnect shows worse energy efficiency than their voltage-mode counterparts due to large static power dissipation by current-sensing circuit [6-7]. This paper presents a 95fJ/b current-mode transceiver for on-chip global interconnect. The transceiver is implemented in 65nm CMOS and achieves a data rate of up to 4Gb/s over a 10mm link with a BER of less than 10-12.",

        "abstract": "Recently reported continuous-time (CT) \u0394\u03a3 modulators with opamp bandwidth compensation and high-order single-opamp integrators have achieved FoM values well below 100fJ/conv-step [1-3]. With loop-filter power greatly reduced, power dissipation in multibit quantizers becomes especially significant. For example, the quantizer in [2] accounts for 2.8mW of 8.5mW total power dissipation. Also, the input capacitance of multibit quantizers and the output parasitics of excess loop delay (ELD) compensation DACs result in increased power demand for summing circuits. To minimize power dissipation, two recent works use 1b quantizers with FIR DACs and replace ELD compensation DACs with a DAC followed by analog filter [3] or with feedback to the pre-amplifier [4]. ELD compensation may also be realized using digital logic following the quantizer [5]. This paper presents a low-power solution based on a highly digital multibit quantizer with embedded feedback to compensate for finite opamp bandwidth along with ELD. The quantizer consumes less than 10% of the total power and simplifies the analog circuits into a single DAC plus a feedforward loop filter with relaxed opamp requirements. Digital correction at the modulator output suggested by early work [6] is employed to shape DAC mismatch with the inherent noise transfer function (NTF) and to further relax circuit constraints. These digitally assisted techniques enable a CT \u0394\u03a3 modulator to achieve an FoM below 28fJ/conv-step.",

        "abstract": "Low-power sensor applications e.g. for environmental monitoring, bio-potential recording, and wireless autonomous sensor networks require highly power-efficient ADCs, typically with resolutions of at least 10b. SAR ADCs are generally beneficial in terms of power efficiency. However, the most power-efficient designs currently lack the required accuracy for these applications [1, 2], as they are limited to 9b ENOB. Other designs that have sufficient accuracy (10b) are limited to power efficiencies above 10fJ/conv-step [3]. The aim of this work is to increase the accuracy of highly efficient SAR ADCs beyond 10b, while further improving the efficiency to 2.2fJ/conv-step. To do so, this work introduces a Data-Driven Noise-Reduction method to efficiently suppress comparator noise, applies a segmented capacitive DAC with 250aF unit elements for better efficiency and accuracy, and implements a self-oscillating comparator to locally generate the internally required oversampled clock.",

In recent reports, time-interleaving techniques and multi-bit-per-cycle conversion have boosted speed to the GHz sampling range at low power consumption. However, to achieve SNR of >70dB at moderate sampling speed, SARs still need a lot of power, namely tens of mW [1-2]. In [1], a very high SNR of 90dB is achieved by a stage to amplify residue charge, which is one of the reasons for the 105mW power consumption at 12.5MS/s. In [2], 8\u00d7 oversampling and a static current pre-amplifier for the comparator improve SNR to 88dB, but the ADC still consumes 66mW. In [3], digital calibration achieves an SNDR of 71dB at 3mW, but double conversion limits the sampling speed to 22.5MS/s.This paper describes a SAR ADC with 71dB SNDR that runs at 50MS/s and consumes 4.2mW. The ADC uses 3 SNDR-enhancement techniques that utilize noise and that have good compatibility to low-voltage fine digital processes.",

        "abstract": "Incremental analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be applied in many instrumentation applications, such as the readout of bridge transducers and smart sensors [1-4]. Such applications require ADCs with high absolute accuracy and linearity, as well as high resolution. Moreover, since the signals of interest are typically near DC, such ADCs must employ robust offset and 1/f noise-reduction techniques. Fulfilling these requirements often results in ADCs with poor energy efficiency, thus preventing their use in systems powered by batteries or energy scavengers. This paper describes a micro-power incremental ADC that achieves 20b resolution, 1\u03bcV offset and 6ppm INL, while dissipating more than an order of magnitude less energy than ADCs with comparable precision [3-6]. This is achieved by the use of a 2-step or zoom ADC architecture [1,2], an inverter-based integrator, and various dynamic error-correction techniques.",

        "abstract": "DACs without continuous clocking are often favored in applications such as medical imaging and scientific instrumentation. The DACs in these high-precision systems are commonly endpoint-calibrated. After this calibration, a non-ideal DAC contributes three main sources of error: noise, temperature drift, and INL. The segmented voltage-mode R-2R DAC is an attractive architecture for reducing the first two of these error sources. Resistor Johnson noise is fixed by the DAC's code-independent output resistance, which is readily lowered by the combination of several parallel segments. The complete signal path can be built using opamps that have a minimal noise gain of unity. This architecture also benefits from inherently zero endpoint error, avoiding any gain or offset drift over temperature. However, this preferred architecture for noise and temperature drift suffers from several sources of INL including: resistor mismatch, voltage losses across CMOS switches, and the nonlinearity of each resistor.",

The supply voltage is scaled down appropriately (0.4 to 0.7V) for different speeds to minimize power consumption of SAR control and switching energy. Moreover, a charge average switching (CAS) DAC is developed to reduce the switching energy of the DAC without an extra voltage reference and common-mode shift. In near-threshold operation with a scaled-down supply, a double-boosted sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit and a local-boosted switch are implemented for the linearity and accuracy requirements of the 10b ADC.",

        "abstract": "In switched-capacitor circuits like \u0394\u03a3 modulators and pipelined ADCs, accurately transferring voltages in sampled-data form, regardless of opamp gain and nonlinearity, has been one of the most challenging issues that analog designers have faced. To date, it has been difficult to achieve high resolution with pipelined ADCs operating at low voltages due to gain and nonlinearity constraints. Digital means of calibration have been suggested to correct opamp nonlinearity, relying on weakly nonlinear transfer functions with coefficients that may need a long time to measure accurately. Alternative types of ADCs that use no opamps, such as successive-approximation, time-domain, and comparator-based designs, have been gaining in popularity. In this paper we implement an inherently exact residue pipelining scheme that is not impaired by opamp gain and nonlinearity. Unlike other calibration methods that sort out errors after they occur, the proposed circuit performs no post analog or digital signal processing, as gain and nonlinearity errors are eliminated entirely at their very sources.",

This is because the input amplifier current consumption is dictated by an input-referred noise requirement that determines the system sensitivity, while the supply voltage is determined by a DR requirement at the analog recording chain output that limits the maximum achievable resolution of the A-to-D conversion. In this paper, a power-efficient neural-recording architecture using a DR-folding technique is presented to enable low-voltage operation without compromising the DR performance. The proposed architecture can operate with only half of the typically required supply voltage, which results in about 50% power reduction.",

        "abstract": "Recording neural activity from freely behaving animals has become extremely important for basic research in neuroscience. One of the major limitations in this domain arises from the need of a low-power, lightweight, wireless recording unit that can be used on small animals for at least a couple of hours. To conserve power, it is essential to reduce the large data volume from tens or even hundreds of recording sites. Since it is widely considered that the primary information in neural recording is limited to the infrequent action potentials (AP or spike), the data can be considerably reduced by using a system based on AP activity [1]. This paper presents a complete activity-dependent wireless system that utilizes an ASIC for recording simultaneous AP and local field potential (LFP) signals, improving the state of the art in terms of performance-to-weight ratio. In spite of large data compression, we demonstrate a method to accurately preserve the AP shape, essential for further processing and spike sorting. Finally, this is the first system (see Fig. 16.4.6 comparison table) particularly designed to take advantage of tetrode (four closely placed electrodes) based neural recording units (Fig. 16.4.1).",

        "abstract": "Retinal implants elicit light perception for people blinded by photoreceptor loss. Commercialized 60-channel retinal prostheses allow patients to perform simple tasks, but several hundreds to a thousand electrodes are required for face recognition/reading [1,2], posing great challenges for the design of next-generation retinal stimulators. Aside from the higher power/data demand, the electrode impedance is also increased. Placing 1000 epiretinal electrodes in the 5mm-diameter macula region reduces the electrode size to less than 0.01mm2, leading to a 30k\u03a9 electrode-tissue impedance [2]. To elicit light perception of various brightness levels, the stimulators for epiretinal prostheses require an output compliance voltage of \u00b110V [3], thus requiring area-consuming high-voltage (HV) transistors. The stimulator in [4] achieves 1600 channels, but it is designed for subretinal rather than epiretinal prostheses. It has \u00b12V compliance and needs a separate chip for power telemetry. For epiretinal prostheses, an HV-compliant 1024-channel stimulator in [3] is estimated to occupy 64mm2 and requires off-chip diodes for power rectification. For a space-restricted retinal implant, a small-sized fully integrated SoC with minimal number of off-chip components is preferred.",

        "abstract": "Since their conception and success in human trials, the flexibility and spatial resolution of retinal prostheses have been of major interest. Clinical studies have revealed that hundreds of channels are needed to restore functional visual perception, and more sophisticated waveforms present advantages over biphasic pulses. Initial designs targeted stimulation current levels up to 1mA to ensure functionality. For such designs, an output compliance of >10V was required, and HV technologies were used at the expense of area and power consumption. Human clinical trials have recently shown that implanted electrodes present a stimulus threshold as low as 50\u03bcA. In addition, advances in implant technology promise close placement of electrode array and retinal tissue, which can further decrease the required current. Thus, highly scaled LV technologies can provide alternative means to reduce area and power, and to support hundreds of flexible independent channels for fully intraocular implants. In this paper, a self-calibrating 512-channel epiretinal prosthesis in 65nm CMOS is presented. It features dual-band telemetry for power and data, clock recovery, a 2-step calibration technique to match biphasic stimulation currents, and an independent arbitrary output waveform per channel. The implant integrates coils (power and data), IC, external capacitors and electrode array using a biocompatible parylene substrate, providing a fully intraocular solution.",

This type of sensor system can also build off the standards used in near-field communications, which provide a great opportunity for communicating with battery-less sensing systems that remain dormant the majority of the time, except when activated by a host system to take measurements. This paper presents a wireless fluorimeter that enables a long-term implantable, continuous glucose-monitoring system. This work merges fluorimetry-based sensing with microsystem technology, to leverage the substantial increases in optical efficiency and provide access to applications where long-term reliability and small form factor are required [2]. Fluorescent transduction also enables full encapsulation of the electrical system, isolating it from an externally placed indicator, which needs to be in continuous equilibrium with its environment.",

Integrated biosensors based on magnetic labeling schemes offer higher sensitivity and lower cost due to the elimination of the optics and have emerged as a viable alternative to assays that use fluorescence for biomolecular detection. For instance, the frequency-shift sensor of [1] demonstrates a high-sensitivity example of a cost-effective magnetic particle biosensor in CMOS with no need for external magnets. Despite their cost and sensitivity advantages, magnetic biosensors reported so far suffer from a lack of multi-probe diagnostics similar to fluorescent-based approaches that use multiple colors for simultaneous single-site multiple target differentiation. This is primarily because current approaches measure changes in the magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7, either at low frequencies [2,3] or at a fixed RF frequency [1]. Consequently, these approaches do not provide a clear path for differentiating between a large number of small magnetic particles vs. a smaller number of larger size particles with similar magnetic content.",

Robust and accurate Heart-Rate (HR) monitoring at the right/left ventricles and the right atrium is essential for an implantable cardiac pacemaker system (Fig. 16.9.1), and ultra-low power consumption is needed. In addition, an accurate motion sensor and thoracic impedance measurement can acquire valuable additional information in clinical research on the intra-cardiac rhythm analysis. As shown in Fig. 16.9.2, our proposed Analog Signal Processor (ASP) IC consists of 3 power-efficient intra-cardiac signal readout channels. Each channel is equipped with a low-power QRS feature extraction unit and an ECG processor in parallel. The ASP also provides an ultra-low-power readout circuit for an external accelerometer (RA). In addition, two quadrature bio-impedance readout channels are used together with a digitized sinusoidal current generator in order to implement an accurate and wide dynamic range bio-impedance measurement. The ASP improves the state of the art by integrating a power-efficient means of QRS feature extraction for detecting Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), and a wide dynamic range bio-impedance readout.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of cloud computing has driven the demand for high-density, low-latency and high-speed memory interfaces. For such applications the use of multiple dual-inline memory modules (DIMMs) with multiple ranks enables time-efficient processing of high-volume data. However, the deterioration of the channel frequency response due to the presence of DIMM connectors and multiple ranks makes it challenging to perform low-power read and write (R/W) operations at high-speed. Recent works have demonstrated the use of near-ground signaling (NGS) for low-power operation and signal-integrity enhancement with the aid of transmit supply regulation. In contrast to their differential nature, this paper introduces a single-ended NGS transceiver that achieves 6.4Gb/s R/W operations with the aid of low-power equalization and in-situ reference-voltage calibration over a 3.5\" total FR4 PCB routing with more than 25mm of package traces in a dual-rank DIMM memory interface system.",

Variable-impedance drivers, on-die termination (ODT), feed-forward equalization (FFE) and slew-rate (SR) control are typically implemented in DDR transmitters to address SI issues. In particular for multi-module, multi-rank configurations where speed throttling must be applied, SR control turns out to be most effective to combat reflections and crosstalk. Slewed signal edges reduce the spectral content above the bit rate frequency, whereas FFE dampens lower frequencies to compensate for channel loss, which may, however, be less of a problem at throttled data rates.",

        "abstract": "DRAM speed already reaches 7Gb/s/pin for GDDR interface [1,4]. As the bit rate increases, jitter of PLL, data-sampling margin, crosstalk and intersymbol interference (ISI) needs considerable management [1,3,5]. Moreover, as the supply voltage decreases, the self-generated internal noise of DRAM increases due to low efficiency of the internal voltage generator, especially the VPP voltage generator [2]. In general, the sensitivity of PLL to supply noise gives rise to large jitter accumulation. If the supply noise frequency is close to the PLL bandwidth, more jitter peaking occurs. Therefore, the PLL bandwidth is an important parameter to achieve low jitter performance [3]. Crosstalk becomes a crucial issue for over 7Gb/s GDDR interface [1]. However, the complexity of the transmitter and the CIO, capacitance of I/O, increase due to additional equalizers and pre- and de-emphasis drivers. For a compact transmitter, a low-overhead boosted transmitter is developed [4]. This paper presents an adaptive-bandwidth PLL in response to the supply and channel noises, a fast pre-charged data sampler without an additional decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), a crosstalk-induced-jitter-reduction technique and a compact transmitter with pre- and de-emphasis.",

        "abstract": "A 20nm high-\u03ba metal-gate planar CMOS technology is optimized and developed for SoC platform applications that span a wide range of power and performance. This technology is based on a 20nm SoC process featuring high-\u03ba metal gate and strain techniques for core logic transistors with low-power/high-performance and I/O transistors. A high-density and a high-performance embedded memory bit cell each has an area <;0.1\u03bcm2. This technology is targeted to high-density low-cost low-power high-performance applications, such as mobile applications with video. Increased threshold-voltage variation of scaled transistors reduces the static noise margin (SNM) and write margin (WM) of the SRAM bit cell. The effect is more predominant for the high-density SRAMs due to small device sizes and large memory capacity requirement for modern SoC design. Therefore, chip performance and minimum operating voltage (VDDmin) are both degraded by the embedded SRAM. Reducing the pass-gate strength or BL capacitance with slow WL rise are effective techniques to improve the SRAM cell stability [1,2]. Underdriving the pass-gate reduces the bit-cell read current but also reduces WM, resulting in SRAM performance degradation. Physically shortening the BL limits the SRAM array configuration. Lowering the SRAM cell power supply improves the WM [3,4], but is less effective than the negative-bitline-based write-assist technique. Compared to conventional techniques, this work presents a partially suppressed wordline (PSWL) scheme for read assist and a bitline-length-tracked negative-bitline-boosting (BT-NBL) scheme for write assist without significantly degrading SRAM performance. With the read/write assist circuitry, the overall VDDmin improvement is over 200mV in a 112Mb SRAM test-chip.",

        "abstract": "Mobile applications such as tablets pack increasingly more processing capability comparable to workstations or laptops but can do little for cooling or extending the battery life in their form factors. SRAMs account for a large fraction of chip area and are critical in this context. Recent work has focused on voltage scaling in SRAMs, which is an effective way of achieving energy efficiency [1,2]. These conventional SRAMs are mostly general-purpose in the sense that they are designed without considering the specific features of the data they will store. However, application-specific features such as statistics of storage data can be exploited and incorporated into the transistor-level design to provide a new dimension towards achieving the next level of energy savings in addition to the savings provided through voltage scaling. The work in [3] is an example where an inversion bit is added for each word to reduce read-bitline (RBL) transitions in an 8T-cell-based design with a single-ended read port. Similarly, the work in [4] stores only the LSBs of each word in 6T SRAMs where occasional bit-errors at low voltages are tolerable for its application. In this work, we focus on video; however, the ideas can be generalized to different applications. In video encoders, pixel processing is performed over large partitions of image frames (e.g., 192\u00d7192 pixels), which are stored in on-chip SRAMs and accessed frequently. Image frames generally consist of smooth backgrounds or large objects where the intensity of pixels is spatially correlated. For the video image frame in Fig. 18.2.1, the deviation of each pixel's intensity from its block average for a 16\u00d716 block shows that 76% of pixels lie within 3 LSB of the average. This additional information can be used to design an SRAM where correlation of data is used to reduce bitline activity factor which, for an 8T SRAM in a 65nm low-power CMOS process, accounts for ~50% of total energy consumption during read a- cesses at 0.6V. In this work, we present a prediction-based reduced-bitline-switching-activity (PB-RBSA) scheme along with a hierarchical sensing network with statistical sense-amplifier gating to exploit the correlation of storage data. Reduction of switching activity on the bitlines and in the sensing network of the memory provide up to 1.9\u00d7 reduction in energy/access.",

        "abstract": "A 64Mb SRAM is fabricated in a 22nm high-performance SOI technology [1]. The ever-increasing integration needs of complex SoC are driving the reduction of SRAM leakage power and increase in memory density. While the area and leakage power benefits of eDRAM continue to be leveraged in applications with large contiguous memory blocks [2], SRAM leakage remains a significant portion of the total SoC power. This work describes an SRAM that is optimized for leakage and performance as top priorities over density. The SRAM features a new bitcell (BC) implemented with a fine-granularity power-gating (FGPG) technique to reduce BC leakage by 37%. FGPG improves leakage reduction by 2\u00d7 compared to bank-based power-gating (PG) techniques [3-4]. Periphery leakage is also reduced by 40% from the previous design [5] with a low-energy power-supply-partition design that leverages higher Vt devices operating at a higher supply voltage. This scheme alone provides an 8% improvement in performance with a small compromise to the AC power.",

In particular, random device-variability-induced pulse shrinkage and misalignment in dynamic signals must be carefully addressed. Described here are a series of new design approaches enabling L1 cache SRAM operation at 7GHz, including a 3-level bitline hierarchy, decreased dynamic path lengths, localized read enables, and a power-savings mechanism in which selective columns can be partially powered down.",

        "abstract": "In order to support higher throughputs, the power consumption of 2-to-5GHz Wi-Fi transmitters (TXs) has been continuously rising, and has hence become increasingly problematic for mobile devices. To extend battery life, the TX must be efficient not only at peak power but also at backoff, due to the use of high Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) OFDM modulation. Many recent works have aimed to enhance PA efficiency at back-off powers [1-4], but relatively few have integrated these techniques into a complete TX system. For example, previous designs employing digital polar or outphasing architectures often realized phase modulation with off-chip instruments. Similarly, while good close-in spectral performance has been shown, far-out spectral images remain problematic for TXs where the PA itself is digitally modulated. Moreover, previous works often do not include overhead from components such as extra DC-DC converters (for multiple PA supplies) or did not implement on-chip matching networks (MN) and/or output baluns, all of which directly affect the overall efficiency of integrated CMOS PAs.",

The digitally-assisted or digital-intensive RF transceivers not only benefit from technology scaling in terms of power efficiency and die area, but also improve functional flexibility. The polar architecture is well recognized for digital RF transmitters [1,2,4,5], while the bandwidth expansion resulting from Cartesian-to-polar transformation makes it difficult to comply with high-speed wireless standards. Open-loop phase interpolation topology was employed in an outphasing transmitter [3], where 12dBm output power was demonstrated with 40MHz 802.11n signal. In this work, an all-digital RF transmitter with direct quadrature architecture is presented to address the need for broadband wireless connectivity.",

        "abstract": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have a spectrum allocation shown in Fig. 19.4.1. The time-to-first-lock and location accuracy can be improved through simultaneous reception of two different satellite signals. This usually necessitates the use of two dedicated receivers [1] driven by a single and sometimes two separate synthesizers, which increases complexity, die area, and most importantly current consumption. To solve this problem, the architecture shown in Fig. 19.4.1 is proposed. The SoC consists of one single reconfigurable low-IF receiver, a single fractional-N frequency synthesizer, and a digital baseband processor. Since different satellite signals are uncorrelated and are buried well below the noise floor, they can be amplified and downconverted by the same RF/analog chain as an image of one another, and then separated in the digital domain by the corresponding correlator and signal processor. In the case of simultaneous GPS/Galileo and Glonass dual reception, the LO (fLO_GG) is set to 1588.608MHz. As a result, the GPS/Galileo signal becomes the image of the Glonass satellite signal with an IF frequency of 13.1MHz. Similarly, when the LO (fLO_GB) is set to 1568.256MHz, the resulting IF frequency is about 7.1MHz for GPS/Galileo and Beidou dual reception. For GPS/Galileo-only reception, the LO (fLO_GPS) is set to 1571.328MHz resulting in an IF frequency of 4.092MHz.",

        "abstract": "Carrier aggregation (CA) is introduced in 3GPP LTE Rel-10 [1] to meet the demand for further increased bitrates. While LTE Rel-10 supports simultaneous reception of two carriers either in contiguous intra-band or in inter-band CA configuration, the upcoming LTE Rel-11 will add support for non-contiguous (NC) carriers within bands. Supporting NC CA in handsets is a demanding challenge for several reasons. Foremost, the total bandwidth spanned by the carriers may be several times the bandwidth of the individual carriers, possibly spanning an entire band with interfering signals between desired carriers. Furthermore, the distance between TX and RX carriers will vary and worse, may be much smaller than the fixed duplex distance for LTE Rel-8 and W-CDMA single carrier operation [2-5].",

In particular, the LTE standard defines multiple RF bands and groups OFDM modulated subcarriers into Resource Blocks (RB) that can be flexibly used within the allocated channel bandwidth. When the transmitted power is concentrated in one or a few RBs, counter-intermodulation products (C-IM) may fall directly or through cross-modulation into the RX band and degrade FDD performance. They may also fall into protected bands and violate spectral emission requirements.",

        "abstract": "For an LTE transceiver it is quite challenging to reduce power and area while preserving performance. For large emitted signals the TX dominates power consumption but in the past this situation was sufficiently infrequent not to affect energy consumption. In recent times the statistical distribution of the TX power has shifted upward due to the use of data-intensive communications and the introduction of multi-gain power amplifiers. Therefore to extend battery life in fourth generation terminals, TX consumption at high power (>-10dBm) should be reduced. A second challenge of an FDD LTE TX is noise and distortion emission in the RX band since the TX-to-RX distance, relative to the channel bandwidth, can be much smaller than in previous standards [1].",

        "abstract": "Signal processing in ultra-wide bandwidths is one of the key challenges in the design of multi-Gb/s wireless transceivers at mm-Waves, where channels covering 57GHz to 66GHz are specified. Further considering spreads due to process variations and the stringent reference phase noise to ensure signal integrity calls for an ultra-wide tuning range and low-noise on-chip oscillator. Meeting this target is even more challenging when adopting an ultra-scaled CMOS technology node where key passive components suffer from a reduced quality factor (Q) [1]. In a 32nm node the thickness of metals closer to the substrate is half that in a 65nm process leading, for example, to MOM capacitors with roughly half Q. The penalty is only marginally compensated by the higher transistor ft, improved only by ~20%. Various techniques exploiting alternative tuning implementations have been published recently. Magnetic tuning methods where the equivalent tank inductance is varied through reflection of the secondary coil impedance of a transformer demonstrate outstanding tuning ranges but at the cost of a severe trade-off with tank Q and poor noise FOMs [2,3]. A bank of capacitors switched in and out in an LC tank is the most popular tuning approach [4-6]. However the quality factor is severely degraded, when large ranges are involved. In this work, the switched-capacitor tank of the VCO shown in Fig. 20.3.1 is centered around two different resonance frequencies by splitting the inductor through the switch Msw. In particular, an up-shift is produced when the switch is off due to its parasitic capacitance. The frequency range is significantly increased without compromising tank Q leading to large tuning range and high FOM simultaneously. Prototypes of the VCO have been realized in 32nm CMOS showing the following performances: 31.6% frequency tuning range, minimum phase noise of -118dBc/Hz at 10MHz offset from 40GHz with 9.8mW power dissipation. Despite being realized in a- ultra-scaled 32nm standard digital CMOS process without RF thick metal options, the oscillator shows state-of-the-art performances.",

        "abstract": "Frequency synthesis at mm-Waves is still dominated by analog PLLs, although all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs) [1] have been widely explored below 10GHz. The major obstacle has been the poor quality of digitally controlled oscillators (DCO) as MOS varactor Q-factor drops to <;10 at 60GHz. A mm-Wave digital transmitter (TX) based on a 60GHz fractional-N ADPLL with two-point FM is proposed here. The TX features extensive reconfigurability and permits the highest degree of integration of RF and baseband circuitry for low-cost, high-volume applications. To simplify the TX architecture, the synthesizer is capable of FM, hence a time-to-digital converter (TDC) is preferred over bang-bang phase detection. With the aid of autonomous calibrations of DCO and TDC gain, wideband two-point FM is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Under the influence of increasing demand for high-data-rate communication systems such as 60GHz band applications, the requirements of PLLs keep getting higher. In a mm-Wave direct-conversion transceiver, the quadrature LO signal generation is challenging. The conventional techniques to generate quadrature LO signals suffer from many problems. The method of using a divide-by-2 divider after a VCO with double LO frequency is popular in multi-GHz designs, but it is difficult to be realized at mm-Wave frequencies. Employing passive RC complex filters is another way to generate quadrature signals, but high power is required to compensate its loss. The conventional parallel-coupled QVCO seems to be a good choice for mm-Wave application. However, the approach suffers from poor phase noise. This work presents a fully integrated 57.9-to-68.3GHz frequency synthesizer, which employs an in-phase injection-coupled QVCO (IPIC-QVCO) to produce low-phase-noise quadrature signals with low power.",

        "abstract": "There are many Digital TV (DTV) standards around the world, such as DVB-T/C/H in Europe, ATSC-C/M/H in North America, TDMB in China, ISDB-T in Japan and DMB-T in South Korea. In recent years, next generations of DVB standards (e.g. DVB-T2 and DVB-C2) are proposed, which adopt 256 QAM and even 4k QAM modulation to obtain higher performance. Often the DTV tuners employ a direct-conversion Zero-IF architecture, which demands the use of a wideband fractional-N synthesizer as the local oscillator (LO) to cover the frequency range of 50 to 900MHz. This LO needs to meet a very stringent phase noise requirement with an adequate target phase noise of -98dBc/Hz at a 10kHz offset and integrated rms phase error less than 0.25\u00b0 [1]. However, it is well known that the performance of fractional-N PLLs is significantly influenced by the circuit nonlinearity. Nonlinearity results in the noise-folding phenomenon, which can seriously degrade the in-band phase noise and raise reference and fractional spurs [2].",

They are even more beneficial to nowadays high-frequency fully integrated converters with output capacitor integrated on-chip. As one of the dominant chip area consumers, reducing the size of the on-chip decoupling capacitors directly leads to cost down. It is reported that a 5\u00d7 capacitor area reduction can be achieved with a four-phase converter compared to a single-phase one [1]. However, the penalty is obvious. Every extra phase comes with an inductor, which is also counted as cost and becomes more dominant with increase in the number of phases.",

        "abstract": "High-data-rate wireless technologies such as HSUPA and LTE are power-hungry because of the fundamental correlation between data rate and transmit power. Furthermore, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the modulated signals causes a degradation in PA efficiency, since the supply voltage of the PA must be high enough to provide the peak output voltage without loss of linearity. Envelope tracking modulators have been proposed to improve the efficiency and linearity of transmitters. Modulators using multiple input voltages have been shown to improve efficiency, but generating multiple supplies imposes substantial overhead. Several recent works have demonstrated a hybrid modulator, combining the output current of a buck output stage with that of a linear amplifier. The hybrid modulator has the notable advantage that the low-frequency power (which constitutes the majority of power, even in high-PAPR scenarios) can be provided through the efficient buck stage. The inherently less efficient linear amplifier stage needs only to supply the high-frequency power. The efficiency of hybrid modulators degrades at moderate power levels, when the ac amplitude is much less than the supply voltage of the linear amplifier. At low power levels, the power savings afforded by the modulator do not offset its own quiescent current, resulting in a lower efficiency than can be achieved using a fixed-drain, average-power-tracking (FD-APT) supply.",

However, for LEDs to completely replace the traditional incandescent and CFL bulbs, the power converters within the LED drivers need to be miniaturized. Superior figure of merit (Rds,ONxQg) of Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs over Silicon FETs [1] can enable both high efficiency and high frequency operation, thereby making power converters smaller, more efficient and reliable. By using integrated controllers and drivers, the number of components on the driver PCB can be reduced, further miniaturizing the driver. This work focuses on demonstrating a small form factor, high efficiency offline LED driver using GaN FETs with an integrated gate driver and controller circuit implemented on a 0.35\u03bcm CMOS process with 3.3V/15V voltage handling capability.",

However, while the supply voltage required for processors and SoCs has scaled down to ~1V, the voltage range of this popular battery remains ~2.9V-4.2V (nominally ~3.6V). To bridge this voltage difference, off-chip power management ICs are typically required. Despite their high efficiency, supporting many independent, high-current supplies to e.g. a multi-core SoC is extremely challenging due to cost, area, and supply impedance concerns associated with board and package level parasitics. There is hence strong motivation for efficient, fully integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) that interface directly with the battery while supporting multiple separate on-chip supply.",

Switched Capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters have gained significant interest as a promising candidate for an integrated energy conversion solution that eliminates the need for inductors [2,3]. However, SC converters efficiency is limited by the conduction loss, bottom plate parasitic capacitance, gate drive loss in addition to the overhead of the control circuit. Reconfigurable SC converters supporting multi-gain settings have been proposed to allow efficient operation across wide output range [2,4]. Also, High density deep trench capacitors with low bottom plate parasitic capacitance have been utilized in [5] achieving a peak efficiency of 90%. In this work, we exploit on-chip ferroelectric capacitors (Fe-Caps) for charge transfer owing to their high density and extremely low bottom plate parasitic capacitance [6]. High efficiency conversion is achieved by combining the Fe-Caps with multi-gain setting converter in a reconfigurable architecture with dynamic gain selection.",

        "abstract": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in general lightings due to their several advantages including high efficiency, high reliability, long life, and environmental friendliness. Recently, various converter-free methods for non-isolated LED drivers with multiple LED strings connected in series have been introduced, enabling both a higher efficiency and power factor (PF) as well as lower total harmonic distortion (THD) [1-3]. In multiple-string LED drivers, the efficiency and PF are enhanced as the number of LED strings increases because of a low overhead voltage. However, as the operational voltage range decreases, it is difficult to find a proper commutation time using input voltage sensing approaches due to input voltage noise and LED voltage variation [4]. Other concerns are EMI and EMC noise caused by high di/dt and dv/dt in hard commutations. When the LED current is high, negative effects of hard commutation become worse and the required di/dt control circuits are more complicated [5]. To meet EMI and EMC regulations for lightings without adding on-board EMI filters, soft commutation is essential. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a soft self-commutating method using a Source-Coupled Pair (SCP) and reference voltages. The conventional control circuits required for an appropriate commutation time and soft commutation are no longer necessary. The fabricated 6-string LED driver IC is capable of achieving high efficiency (92.2%), high PF (0.996) and low THD (8.6%) under the 22W/110V AC condition.",

This paper presents a <;4\u03bcW heart-rate (HR) monitor IC based on measurement of fluctuations in the light intensity passing through tissue such as a finger. As shown in Fig. 22.3.1, key components of the system include a logarithmic, digital-to-resistance converter (DRC) that forms the load of an external photodiode, and a non-uniform quantizer that provides error information to a digital accumulator controlling the DRC input. As the photodiode current fluctuates due to HR-induced pulsing of bloodflow through the tissue, the feedback loop adjusts the DRC load resistance in order to maintain constant voltage across the photodiode. As such, the accumulator output, OUTADC[k], provides a digital representation of HR-induced fluctuations of the photodiode current, and the logarithmic implementation of the DRC accommodates 3 orders of magnitude in light intensity. In order to obtain instantaneous HR frequency, HR[k], off-chip digital signal processing is performed on OUTADC[k].",

        "abstract": "Capacitive touch-screen technology introduces new concepts to user interfaces, such as multi-touch, pinch zoom-in/out gestures, thus expanding the smartphone market. However, capacitive touch-screen technology still suffers from performance degradation like a low frame scan rate and poor accuracy, etc. One of the key performance factors is the immunity to external noise, which intrudes randomly into the touch-screen system. HUM, display noise, and SMPS are such noise sources. The main electrical power source produces HUM, one of the most important sources of noise, which has a 50 or 60Hz component. Display noise is emitted when an LCD or OLED is driven by the internal timing controller, which generates the driving signal in the tens of kHz range. The touch performance of On-Cell or In-Cell touch displays is seriously affected by this kind of noise, because the distance between the display pixel layer and the capacitive touchscreen panel is getting smaller. SMPS is another noise source that ranges up to 300kHz. The charger for a smart-phone, the USB port in a computer, a tri-phosphor fluorescent light bulb are all examples of sources of SMPS. There have been many attempts to remove such noise. Amplitude modulation with frequency hopping is proposed in [1]. However, when the noise environment changes, this method needs recalibration, resulting in non-constant touch response time. Another method tries to filter the noise from the display [2], but it does not remove other noise sources like HUM or SMPS.",

Capacitive TSPs can be classified into self-capacitance [1,2] or mutual-capacitance [3-5] types, according to the sensing mechanism. Compared with the self-capacitance types, which offer low cost and high scan frequency from the simple line-sensing scheme, the mutual-capacitance types, which read out all sensor pixels, are presently widely preferred due to their multi-touch capabilities. However, the reduced sensing time for each sensor makes it difficult to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, good noise performance in the analog front-end of the touch controller is essential for mutual-capacitance type TSPs.",

        "abstract": "To achieve high image quality in mobile active-matrix LCDs, higher DAC resolution and good channel-to-channel uniformity are required in column-driver ICs. In conventional column-driver ICs, the resistor-DAC (R-DAC) architecture has been generally used due to its uniform characteristic, because each R-DAC in driver channels shares a common resistor string for gamma reference-voltage generation. Furthermore, nonlinear gamma correction can be easily implemented using a nonlinear resistor-string that has an inverse transfer curve to the liquid crystal (LC) response. However, the increase in color depth for LCDs results in a large chip-size overhead, thus disclosing the limitation of the R-DAC architecture. To overcome this issue, several hybrid DAC architectures composed of a main 6b R-DAC and a 4b sub-DAC with various interpolation schemes have been reported [1-5]. Their linear interpolation schemes reduce the driver channel size. Meanwhile, their linear 4b interpolation leads to the loss of effective bit resolution for nonlinear gamma correction. In addition, the inevitable mismatch between respective sub-DACs has a significant influence on the channel-to-channel uniform performance of a column-driver IC. In this paper, we present a 10b column-driver IC with a mismatch-free switched-capacitor (SC) interpolation scheme for mobile AMLCDs. The proposed mismatch-free interpolation scheme provides further reduction of the driver size, good linearity, highly uniform channel performance, and more effective bit resolution.",

        "abstract": "3D ultrasound imaging is becoming increasingly prevalent in the medical field. Compared to conventional 2D imaging systems, 3D imaging can provide a detailed view of tissue structures that makes diagnosis easier for the physicians. In addition, 2D image slices can be formed at various orientations to the transducer, making the examination less dependent on the skill of the sonographer. However, various challenges exist in developing a 3D imaging system, such as integration of a large number of elements, as well as post-processing of datasets received from a large number of channels. 2D transducer arrays are typically integrated with custom ICs in the probe handle to perform some intermediate beamforming and to reduce the number of cable connections to the imaging system. Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have emerged as an alternative to piezoelectric transducers. Being a MEMS device, they greatly benefit from flexibility and ease of fabrication, and can be seamlessly integrated with electronics. Previous work demonstrates 3D stacking of CMUTs and dummy ICs with an intermediate interposer layer. However, that represents more of a mechanical demonstration of 3D integration. In this paper, we present a fully functional 3D ultrasound imaging system comprising a 32\u00d732 2D CMUT array, 3D-stacked with front-end ICs using flip-chip bonding technology. The imaging system is capable of capturing real-time volumetric ultrasound data, and displaying 2D and 3D ultrasound images.",

        "abstract": "Compact low-power signaling schemes to drive on-chip interconnects are needed for processor chips where high-bandwidth data buses connect processor cores and on-chip cache. Since a significant portion of the signaling power is dynamic power spent on driving long wires, reducing the signal swing improves power efficiency [1-3]. In addition, charge-recycling techniques reduce signal swing by stacking circuits with regular and predictable data switching activities, such as logic circuits [4] and clocking circuits [5]. Unlike conventional schemes, low-swing I/O that leverages charge-recycling techniques offers the potential for quadratic power reduction. We present a compact low-power I/O for on-chip signaling using charge-recycling stacked drivers and compact voltage regulators/converters. A receiver circuit modified from a parametric amplifier-based design [6] further improves the area and power efficiency.",

        "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC) systems demand aggressive scaling of memory and I/O to achieve multiple terabits/sec of bandwidth. Minimizing I/O cost, area and power are crucial to achieving a practically realizable system with such large bandwidth. To meet these needs, we developed a low-power dense 64-lane I/O system with per-port aggregate bandwidth up to 1Tb/s and 2.6pJ/bit power efficiency. We developed a high-density connector and cable, attached to the top side of the package that enables this high interconnect density. A lane-failover mechanism provides design robustness for fault-tolerance. To further optimize power efficiency, the lane data rate scales from 2 to 16Gb/s with non-linear power efficiency of 0.8 to 2.6pJ/bit, providing scalable aggregate bandwidth of 0.128 to 1Tb/s. Highly power scalable circuits such as CMOS clocking and reconfigurable current-mode (CM) or voltage-mode (VM) TX driver enable the 8\u00d7 bandwidth and 3\u00d7 power efficiency scalability with aggressive supply voltage scaling (0.6 to 1.08V).",

        "abstract": "High-volume, mm-range, contact-less interfaces between modules, which would replace existing interfaces that use wire harnesses and connectors, are expected to be employed in many applications because they would provide such features as immunity to mechanical failures due to vibration/friction, isolation from water/chemicals, and lower fabrication costs. Such conventional radio-wave techniques as UWBs or mm-waves that have been optimized for communication at distances greater than 1cm would suffer from inefficiency in power performance compared with wireline communications. This paper introduces proximity communication using a coupler-in-package that provides a wide-band channel between modules. The relatively large coupler-size in our coupler-in-package permits communication distances to be 1cm or less, while conventional techniques for communication between stacked chips [1,2] have communication distances of less than hundreds of \u03bcm. The wideband channel enables baseband communication between chips to support Gb/s-range data transfer with power efficiency comparable to that of conventional wireline transceivers.",

        "abstract": "Memory links use variable-impedance drivers, feed-forward equalization (FFE) [1], on-die termination (ODT) and slew-rate control to optimize the signal integrity (SI). An asymmetric DRAM link configuration exploits the availability of a fast CMOS technology on the memory controller side to implement powerful equalization, while keeping the circuit complexity on the DRAM side relatively simple. This paper proposes the use of Tomlinson Harashima precoding (THP) [2-4] in a memory controller as replacement of the afore-mentioned SI optimization techniques. THP is a transmitter equalization technique in which post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) is cancelled by means of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter with modulo-based amplitude limitation; similar to a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) on the receive side. However, in contrast to a DFE, THP does not suffer from error propagation.",

        "abstract": "For chip-to-chip parallel interfaces, maintaining low power consumption while achieving high aggregate bandwidth is the key trend. Forwarded-clock (FC) architecture is well suited to this trend because of the simple structure and inherent correlation of clock and data jitter [1]. Clock-recovery circuits consume a large portion of the I/O power. PLL/DLLs with a phase interpolator are widely used for the clock recovery circuits. However, they dissipate high power and jitter-tracking bandwidth (JTB) is low (PLL) or high (DLL), degrading the jitter correlation between data and clock. Recently, injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) have drawn much attention for the clock-recovery circuit of the FC interfaces due to their low power consumption [3-6]. By de-tuning the free-running frequency of an ILO, clock deskew can be performed and multiphase clocks can be generated without an additional multiphase generator. Also, ILOs can provide JTB of several hundred MHz, which is optimal for the FC interfaces in terms of the jitter correlation and BER [5].",

        "abstract": "Fractional-N PLLs play an important role in both wireless and wireline circuits. Finer timing resolution is needed to reduce the quantization noise in the phase domain. In conventional designs, a phase interpolator (PI) is used to suppress the quantization noise due to its simplicity, but at a cost of gain error and non-linearity. These sub-phase non-idealities result in large fractional spurs [2-5]. Techniques for reducing these spurs include using a PI mismatch and spur-cancellation scheme [2], digital correlation and cancellation [3], use of a successive requantizer with switched loop filter and offset charge-pump [4], and foreground calibration [5]. This paper presents a ring-oscillator based 2MHz bandwidth fractional-N PLL that uses a spectrally shaped segmented-feedback approach to alleviate fractional spurs induced by the PI non-idealities. This approach results in a compact design and, in contrast to previous work, achieves a 26dB spur reduction without need of correlation, cancellation, or calibration methods.",

        "abstract": "Analog computation is potentially more efficient in certain arithmetic operations since a single wire can represent multiple bits of information, while digital systems retain advantages, for example, in logical operations. However, the use of conventional voltage-domain analog computation [1, 2] is limited due to its poor scalability, design complexity, and the overhead of interface circuits (i.e. ADC/DAC) to a surrounding digital system. Therefore, an alternate technique is required for exploiting the efficiency of analog computation. In this paper, we propose time-domain analog and digital mixed (TDMixed) signal processing, wherein time instead of voltage is utilized as the analog signal. To verify the validity of the TDMixed signal processing, we implement an (32, 8) low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder in 65nm CMOS. The decoder achieves power and area efficiencies of 10.4pJ/b and 6.1Gb/s/mm2, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The primary design goal of a communication or storage system is to allow the most reliable transmission or storage of more information at the lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). State-of-the-art channel codes including turbo and binary LDPC have been extensively used in recent applications [1-2] to close the gap towards the lowest possible SNR, known as the Shannon limit. The recently developed nonbinary LDPC (NB-LDPC) code, defined over Galois field (GF), holds great promise for approaching the Shannon limit [3]. It offers better coding gain and a lower error floor than binary LDPC. However, the complex nonbinary decoding prevents any practical chip implementation to date. A handful of FPGA designs and chip synthesis results have demonstrated throughputs up to only 50Mb/s [4-6]. In this paper, we present a 1.15Gb/s fully parallel decoder of a (960, 480) regular-(2, 4) NB-LDPC code over GF(64) in 65nm CMOS. The natural bundling of global interconnects and an optimized placement permit 87% logic utilization that is significantly higher than a fully parallel binary LDPC decoder [7]. To achieve high energy efficiency, each processing node detects its own convergence and applies dynamic clock gating, and the decoder terminates when all nodes are clock gated. The dynamic clock gating and termination reduce the energy consumption by 62% for energy efficiency of 3.37nJ/b, or 277pJ/b/iteration, at a 1V supply.",

        "abstract": "Using ultra low-voltage (ULV) is a viable approach towards lowering power consumption. However, due to the narrowing gap between the supply voltage and the threshold voltage, ULV designs inevitably suffer from either low performance or high leakage [1, 2]. Specifically, for applications that demand performance, low-threshold devices must be used and so leakage remains a significant problem. The most effective approach to cutting down leakage is power gating. In this regard, the SCCMOS [3] (Fig. 24.4.1, left) uses additional boost signals to \u201csuper cutoff\u201d the leakage current. In SCCMOS, a charge pump is used to generate the boost signal, and the pump has to be on during the standby period to maintain the boost signal. As such, the leakage saved by the super cutoff may be far less than that consumed by the charge pump, negating the power advantages of ULV SCCMOS.",

        "abstract": "The unrelenting demands of wireless/multimedia DSP workloads necessitate specialized hardware to achieve higher performance and power efficiency. Razor systems offer even greater power efficiency by minimizing static supply voltage (VDD) guardbands for process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variation, while also providing a degree of resilience to general delay faults (e.g. SEUs). To date, Razor has only been demonstrated on silicon in the context of microprocessor pipelines [1][2]. Reported Algorithmic Noise Tolerance (ANT) circuits [3][4] operate at very high error rates, but rely on imbalanced ripple-carry adders and hence clock frequency (Fclk) is limited (50-88MHz). ANT also requires additional datapaths for error detection/correction, which cannot be clock gated in the absence of errors, increasing baseline area and power. Combining Razor error detection with algorithm-level correction enables high-Fclk datapaths and low-overheads. A 0.19mm2 16-tap Razor FIR datapath is fabricated in 65nm LP CMOS, with input and output SRAMs, tunable pulse-clock generator, BIST logic and an AHB slave on-chip bus interface (Fig. 24.5.1), demonstrating: 1) two distinct fixed-latency Razor error-correction techniques for real-time DSP datapaths: time-borrow tracking (TBT) and interpolation-based approximate error correction (AEC); 2) a Razor latch (RZL) circuit with reduced pessimism; 3) a 1GHz datapath, an order of magnitude improvement over [3][4] due to elimination of ripple-carry adders; 4) energy efficiency improvement of up to 37%.",

        "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSN) have a wide range of applications in health care and life style monitoring. Their severe energy constraint is often addressed through minimizing the amount of transmitted data by way of energy-efficient on-node signal processing. The rationale for this approach is that a large portion of WSN energy is consumed by the radio communication even for very low-data-rate situations [1]. Efficient on-node processing has been the subject of recent work, with the common element being aggressive voltage scaling into the sub-threshold region [2-4]. A major assumption of the existing works is that the amount of required computation is low, justifying an on-node processor with limited computational capability. While this might be the case for many applications of WSNs, emerging ambulatory biomedical signal processing applications exceed the performance offered by today's on-node processors.",

Without NVL, a chip would either have to keep all flip-flops powered resulting in high standby power, or waste energy and time rebooting after power-up. For energy harvesting applications, NVL is a \u201cmust have\u201d because there is no constant power source available to keep flip-flops (FFs) alive, and even when the intermittent power source is available, boot-up code alone may consume all of the harvested energy. For handheld devices with limited cooling and battery capacity, zero-leakage IC's with \u201cinstant-on\u201d capability are ideal.",

        "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) stacking of memory chips is a promising direction for implementing memory systems in mobile applications and for low-cost high-performance computation. The requirements are extremely low power consumption, high data bandwidth, stability and scalability of operation, as well as large storage capacity with a small footprint. A digital control chip at the base of the stack is needed to efficiently access the 3D memory hierarchy, as well as to emulate a standard memory interface for compatibility. The overall performance and yields of a 3D system are constrained by vertical communication channels among the stacked chips, as well as the connections to the PCB. However, the empirical models presently used in the design stage do not properly represent the electrical and mechanical properties and performance variations of through silicon vias (TSVs) and microbumps (\u03bcBumps). What is needed are circuit techniques that handle such uncertainties to enable the creation of robust 3D data links. This paper presents a complete test vehicle for TSV-based wide I/O data communication in a three-tier 3D chip stack assembled in a BGA package. In-place eye-diagram and waveform capturers are mounted in an active silicon interposer to characterize vertical signaling through the chain of TSVs and \u03bcBumps.",

        "abstract": "Near Field Communication (NFC) is an emerging technology that is penetrating the mobile phone market rapidly. Compliance to multiple NFC standards [1-3] requires designs to support wide dynamic range of field (0.15 to 12A/m), multiple data rates (1.65 to 848Kb/s), various modulation transition times (0.01 to 8usec), wide range of modulation indices (8 to 100%) and line coding techniques (Manchester, NRZ, Modified Miller and PPM). Also, support for small antenna size and very low power card emulation (tag) operation results in additional design constraints. The solution described here integrates all the NFC functions on a multi-IP connectivity SOC in 45nm CMOS.",

        "abstract": "Future biomedical and internet-of-things applications are driving the volume of wireless sensors into the cubic-mm regime. At the mm-scale, complete integration is necessary, and operation within the limits of a micro-battery becomes a primary challenge [1]. With CMOS scaling and ultra-low-power circuits reducing battery volume, the antenna and crystal quickly become the largest components in a cubic-mm node. Higher-frequency operation and silicon-based timing circuits are critical to integrate these components. This paper presents a fully-integrated 9.8GHz impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radio with an on-chip 2mm monopole and the option of wire-bonding to an off-chip antenna. The crystal is replaced with a novel temperature-compensated relaxation oscillator. Due to modern mm-scale battery limitations, the peak current draw must be <;100\u03bcA [2], far below typical radio power consumption. Furthermore, external capacitors are too large for mm-scale nodes; thus, duty-cycling only at the packet level is not an option. This IR-UWB radio includes current-limiting at the battery supply, and the integrated modem duty-cycles the RF front-end at the bit-level in order to operate from integrated storage capacitance. Finally, many recent transceivers operate at <;1V [3,4]; however the voltage of a micro-battery is 3.2~4.1V [2] and integrated conversion efficiency is <;80% [1,5]. Thus, this radio is designed to operate the RF blocks over the entire battery voltage range.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a multistandard ultra-low-power (ULP) 2.36/2.4GHz transceiver for personal and body-area networks (PAN/BAN). The presented radio complies with 3 short-range standards: Bluetooth Low Energy (BT-LE), IEEE802.15.4 (ZigBee) and IEEE802.15.6 (Medical Body-Area Networks, MBAN). A proprietary 2Mb/s mode is also implemented to support data-streaming applications like hearing aids. Current short-range radios for Zigbee and BT-LE typically consume more than 20mW DC power, which is rather high for autonomous systems with limited battery energy. The dual-mode MBAN/BT-LE transceiver achieves a power consumption of 6.5mW for the RX and 5.9mW for the TX by employing a sliding-IF RX and a polar TX architecture. However, it suffers from limited RX image rejection and needs a PA operating at a higher supply voltage. In this paper, an energy-efficient radio architecture with a suitable LO frequency plan is selected, and several efficiency-enhancement techniques for the critical RF circuits (e.g., a push-pull mixer and a digitally-assisted PA) are utilized. As a result, the presented transceiver dissipates only 3.8mW (RX) and 4.6mW (TX) DC power from a 1.2V supply, while exceeding all of the PHY requirements of above 3 standards.",

Also, the signals can be conveyed in the current domain to enhance the area efficiency (i.e., no AC-coupling capacitor), RF bandwidth and linearity at those inner nodes. The 2.4GHz LMV cell [1] for ZigBee RX is an example that unifies one LNA, two mixers (I/Q) and one VCO. The power is low (2.4mW), but the NF, gain and S11 are sensitive to its external high-Q inductor that performs narrowband input match and passive gain boost. Although one VCO (i.e., one inductor) can save area and power, the I/Q generator has to be placed in the RF path. Realized as a gm-C network, it suffers from a 3dB gain loss deteriorating the RX NF (12dB), while rendering the I/Q accuracy more susceptible to process variation.",

There are also reported energy efficient FSK or QPSK transmitters for biomedical applications [2,3]. Hence, a reconfigurable TX that can support multichannel and multimodulation with reconfigurable data rate, spectrum and energy efficiency would be desirable. Although a conventional mixer-based or fractional-N-PLL-based TX with two-point modulation [4] can achieve the aim, the need of power hungry blocks and sophisticated calibration does not lead to power-efficient solutions. On the other hand, energy efficient injection-locked FSK or QPSK TX with good noise performance does not provide multichannel support due to the use of fixed references [2-3]. Energy efficient FSK TXs [5] with open-loop VCO have also been reported. However, they exhibit poor spectrum efficiency and do not support PSK modulation due to the poor phase noise of free-running VCOs.",

Recently, long-range car key applications have become popular, requiring the support of longer radio links within the boundaries of legislation and battery life. BPSK DSSS modulation allows increasing the transmitter power without violating legislation on maximum transmitted power density, but at the cost of having a non-constant RF signal envelope and a larger signal bandwidth. Unfortunately both these properties are not supported by classical narrow-band FSK/ASK transceivers.",

        "abstract": "Large-area electronics presents new form factors, enabling ubiquitous systems that are flexible and capable of scaling to very large areas. By processing thin-film transistors (TFTs) at low temperatures on plastic (using organics, amorphous silicon, metal oxides, etc.), blocks such as ADCs, amplifiers, and processors can be realized [1,2]; however, aside from short-range RFID tags [3], wireless links for long-range communication have not been achieved. A key challenge is that wireless systems typically depend on the ability to generate and operate at high frequencies, yet TFTs are limited to very low performance (ft ~1MHz). Specifically, the challenge is low device gm, due to low mobility and limited gate-dielectric scalability, as well as high device capacitance, due to limited feature scalability and large overlaps for alignment margining on flexible substrates. This work presents a super-regenerative (SR) transceiver with integrated antenna on plastic that leverages the attribute of large area to create highquality passives; this enables resonant TFT circuits at high frequencies (near ft) and allows for large antennas, maximizing the communication distance. The resulting carrier frequency is 900kHz, and the range is over 12m (at 2kb/s). As shown in Fig. 25.10.1, this will enable sheets with integrated arrays of radio frontends for distributing a large number of communication links over large areas.",

        "abstract": "Increasing demand for bandwidth has resulted in broad adoption of 10G Ethernet throughout the network infrastructure. A wide array of standards has been developed supporting 10GE over both fiber and copper media. A particularly challenging standard is Long Reach Multimode (LRM), which targets installed base multi-mode fiber. The challenging communication channels presented by legacy fibers at the 10.3Gb/s rate lend themselves to the use of DSP-based adaptive receivers. Such receivers can be designed to be quite flexible - at once capable of meeting the performance requirements for multiple 10GE standards for all media: short- and long-reach multi-mode fiber (MMF), 10-to-80km single-mode fiber (SMF), as well as PCB backplanes and copper cable channels. A critical block for such receivers is the frontend ADC that digitizes the incoming data. This paper describes a 40nm CMOS 10.3GS/s, 6b Flash ADC used as the analog frontend for a DSP-based receiver that meets the requirements for all the NRZ 10G Ethernet standards, for both fiber (LRM, SR, LR, ER ZR) and copper channels (KR and CX1) [1].",

        "abstract": "Over the last years several low-power time-interleaved (TI) ADC designs in the 2.5-to-3.0GS/s range have been published [1-3], intended for integration in applications like radar, software-defined radio, full-spectrum cable modems, and multi-channel satellite reception. It is to be expected that future generations of these applications will require a higher ADC sampling rate, while maintaining good high-frequency linearity. Furthermore, a high spectral purity is desired, as spurs can cause an SNR degradation of several dB for weak narrowband signals. For interleaved converters, this mandates an output with limited interleaving artifacts. For the reception of broadband and multi-carrier signals, the gain mismatch and time-skew tones do not typically limit performance, since the spurs are evenly spread over frequency due to the broadband nature of the input signal. The offset mismatches, however, generate spurs at fixed frequencies, thereby representing the main performance limitation. This paper presents a prototype 3.6GS/s 11b TI SAR ADC with a THD that is better than -55dB at 2.5GHz and that has gain and offset spurs below -80dBFS, consuming 795mW in 65nm CMOS.",

We present an asynchronous redundant single-channel ADC achieving 1.2GS/s at 1V supply by using two comparators in alternation to relax comparator reset timing.

        "abstract": "By taking advantage of the merits of the low power consumption and hardware simplicity of SAR ADCs, 2b/cycle conversion structures in SAR ADCs have been actively studied in recent years for enhanced conversion rates and excellent FoM [1-3]. However, many error sources in the 2b/cycle SAR ADCs, such as mismatches between DACs and comparators, and the signal-dependent errors from comparators, namely kickback noise and offset, make it difficult to achieve high resolution. To date, pure 2b/cycle structures operating above hundreds of MS/s have shown a somewhat limited resolution with an ENOB lower than 7 at Nyquist rates [1,2]. As a derivation of the structure, a sub-ADC could be implemented using the 2b/cycle SAR ADC structure for high resolution as in [4], at the cost of increased circuit complexity and static current flow. In this work, we present a resolution-enhancing design technique for 2b/cycle SAR ADCs with negligible hardware overhead, while relieving the requirements for the aforementioned errors: Reconfiguration from a 2b/cycle structure to a normal 1b/cycle SAR ADC with error-correction capability achieves an 8.6 ENOB from a 9b ADC.",

        "abstract": "Successive-approximation ADCs (SARs) have excelled in two spaces: in very-high-SNR applications where the precision and stability of capacitors are leveraged along with the use of large signal swings and in high-speed, low-resolution applications in which the SAR's low power and simplicity has enabled high levels of time-interleaving. In between, ADCs with greater than 10 effective bits and sample rates above 20MS/s are typically not based on the SAR architecture. The sequential nature of the SAR algorithm makes it difficult to achieve both high speed and high accuracy, as increasing the resolution requires each bit decision to be both faster and lower noise. This paper presents a SAR that overcomes some of the conventional speed limitations; it uses a 1.2V-only supply and achieves >70dB SNDR at 80MS/s, which extends the state of the art while maintaining comparable FoM.",

The critical challenges for DACs are to realize the highest-possible spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) and inter-modulation distortion (IMD) at the widest possible signal bandwidth. However, the above performances are degraded by many nonlinear causes, e.g., parasitic capacitor-induced finite output impedance [1], current-source (CS) mismatch, and input-code dependent switching transients [2]. While CS mismatch and input-code dependent switching transients result in distortion tones, the parasitic capacitor-induced finite output impedance further limits the high-linearity bandwidth and causes the SFDR to drop at high signal frequencies. In addition, low power consumption and small area are important factors for low-power applications and reduced implementation cost, respectively.",

Several low-power imagers have been reported for application to wireless sensor networks [1,2]. However, the biggest power consumption comes from wireless signal transmission due to the large bandwidth of image signals [3]. One way to reduce the bandwidth is to generate signals only when an event happens, by monitoring temporal changes [3-5]. However, this event-based imaging has extraneous redundancy because the sensor may also respond to environmental conditions, such as change of illumination or background movement in addition to actual target objects.",

        "abstract": "Conventional CMOS image sensors widely used in products currently on the market are mainly equipped with a rolling exposure function. This rolling exposure causes so-called \u201cJell-o effect\u201d distortion when capturing a moving target. CMOS image sensors with a global-shutter function are one of the solutions to avoid this distortion. An in-pixel storage node is required to create a global-shutter CMOS image sensor. A floating diffusion and an additional capacitor can be used as an in-pixel storage node [1,2]. The light sensitivity of the in-pixel storage node is specified by the parasitic light sensitivity (PLS), which is the ratio of the light sensitivity of an in-pixel storage node and the light sensitivity of a photodiode. The PLS should be small enough so that the in-pixel storage is not light-sensitive. Artifacts are captured in an image from bright moving objects during read-out if the PLS is not small enough. The PLS of reported global-shutter CMOS image sensors is around -100dB. That would be small enough to use those image sensors in fields where the light source can be controlled. However, for DSC usage, users can easily encounter scenes with bright objects (e.g. sunlight or car headlights). Even if the in-pixel storage node is light-shielded, it is difficult to perfectly protect the in-pixel storage node from photo-generated carriers, as long as the in-pixel storage node and a photodiode are on the same silicon substrate. Meanwhile, 3D stacking technologies have been introduced for image sensors to give them more functionality and improved performance [3,4]. The reported minimum interconnection pitches for image sensors are over 20\u03bcm. These technologies do not fit the smaller pixel pitches of the image sensors in recent DSCs. In this paper, we report a rolling-shutter distortion-free 3D stacked image sensor with an in-pixel storage node of -160dB parasitic light sensitivity. The image sensor virtually achieves a global-shutter functi- n using a 4-times frame-shutter operation. The image sensor has 2 semiconductor substrates, where 1 substrate has a backside-illuminated photodiode array and the other a storage-node array. The image sensor achieves a PLS level of -160dB. The image sensor has 8.6\u03bcm pitched interconnections, and an interconnection yield of over 99.9% is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear imaging technique that provides functional 3-dimensional images of the body, finding its key applications in clinical oncology and brain-function analyses. The typical PET scanner is composed of a ring of scintillator crystals that absorb gamma rays and emit photons as a result, coupled to photon-sensing devices. The photons hit the sensors with a certain spread in space and time, depending on the material and geometry of the crystals. The sensors must then estimate the energy, the time of arrival (ToA), and the axial position of incoming gamma rays. Most commercially available scanners use photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which are sensitive to magnetic fields, as the sensing element, making the integration of these systems with Magnetic-Resonance Imaging (MRI) impossible. A significant amount of research has focused on replacing PMTs with solid-state detectors, such as Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) [1], which can be integrated with MRI while maintaining the high-sensitivity of PMTs.",

        "abstract": "A number of potentially low-cost time-of-flight (ToF) 3D image sensors aiming at consumer electronics applications have recently appeared in CMOS. Diffused-light sensors taking advantage of SPAD pixels, conventional and pinned-photodiode lock-in pixels demonstrate centimeter-ranging performance in distances of typically up to 6m, and with the exception of, under low background light (BG) conditions. In those approaches, however, performance tends to rapidly deteriorate in severe BG conditions, such as outdoors, and long-distance ranges have yet to be reported. Another common limitation is their inability to cope with multi-echo target environments. Higher optical signal-to-background ratio (SBR), and hence better performance, is typically achieved by laser-scanning approaches, e.g. employing polygonal or MEMS mirrors. With the emerging need for high-resolution light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technologies in advanced driving-assistance systems (ADAS), we introduce an SoC that performs time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) and complete DSP for a 100m-range ToF sensor. The chip provides the system-level electronics with a serial and low-bit-rate digital interface for: multi-echo distance, distance reliability, intensity, and BG-only intensity, thus mitigating system-level complexity and cost.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, both the scientific and industrial communities have shown an increasing interest in range imaging, due to its potential exploitation in various application domains such as robotics, security and surveillance, vehicle safety, gaming, and mobile applications. Among the diversity of techniques available for range detection, Time-of-Flight (ToF) offers advantages in terms of compact system realization, good performance, and low required computational power. The last works on ToF sensors, presenting demodulation sensors based on photon-mixing devices [1, 2], and time-counting sensors based on single-photon avalanche diodes [3], have shown a trend towards higher resolutions, with a consequent reduction of pixel size, higher modulation frequencies, and demodulation contrast to allow better distance precision. In this paper, we introduce a range camera concept that exploits linear-mode avalanche photodiodes (APD) as in-pixel demodulating detectors [4]. Thanks to photocurrent gain modulation, APDs can combine optical sensing and light-signal demodulation in a single device. The main advantage of the APD implementation is the possibility to operate at high frequencies, due to its very wide bandwidth.",

In order to make binocular parallax, which is essential for 3D imaging, the input pupil of the camera lens is presumed to consist of the right-eye and the left-eye domains, where the pixels exclusively receiving light beams from the right-eye domain and those from the left-eye domain, are arranged alternately. In addition, the sensor features an on-chip lenticular lens to split the incident light from the two directions and a Digital Micro Lens [1,2] to focus the split light beams onto the dedicated pixels without significant crosstalk. The fabricated 3D image sensor enables not only successful stereovision imaging in color with sufficiently high sensitivity, but also accurate calculation of distance.",

        "abstract": "Low-power and small-area implementations are essential in the mobile-phone market. Serial signal-processing architectures, in which signal-processing circuits such as a programmable-gain amplifier (PGA) and an ADC can be shared by column-level correlated double sampling (CDS) circuits, promise to reduce chip size and power consumption. However, conventional column CDS circuits composed of linear capacitors or NMOS capacitors (NMOSCAPs) with output buffers (OBUFs) still occupy a large footprint. In this work, to reduce the area and the power consumption of column CDS circuits while keeping high linearity, 1.5V PMOS capacitors (PMOSCAPs) are employed. These capacitors work as low-cost sample-and-hold (S/H) capacitors as well as voltage level-shifters by using body-terminal control. To reduce the power consumption of the ADC, instead of a conventional pipeline ADC, we propose a 10b self-differential offset-cancelled pipeline SAR-ADC. It operates with the reference voltage of the ADC's half full-scale voltage (Vfs), leading to a reduction of 80% switching power and 50% capacitor DAC (CDAC) area in the ADC. A black-level correction function is built in the ADC without any additional DACs. The proof-of-concept circuits are implemented in a 1.4Mpixel CMOS image sensor that consumes 51.0mW with a frame rate of 17fps and a read noise of 187.5\u03bcVrms at 8.1\u00d7 analog gain.",

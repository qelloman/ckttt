        "abstract": "Industry application trends are driving more 3D circuitry both at the chip and system level. These technology trends are inducing new design challenges that require the semiconductor design community to go beyond existing approaches and to come up with new methods to address the challenges of smarter chips. A new design paradigm is becoming imperative to handle end-market demand for more product functionality and the corresponding increase in the complexity of the design task. To address products' distinct technological and design requirements while keeping design cycles within appropriate time-to-market windows, chip designers must leverage solutions that can be supplied by the expertise and assets of semiconductor ecosystems. At the same time, these ecosystems must evolve beyond technology-centric solutions to provide application-specific platform solutions required to meet unique product needs. This paper provides initial direction for the innovation required to realize a smart-chip design paradigm that encompasses design solutions at the chip and system level.",

Their power derives from the use of quantum bits, which can exist in both 0 and 1 simultaneously, a so-called quantum superposition state. This leads to a computing power that doubles with every additional quantum bit. This paper will introduce the basic concepts behind quantum computing, summarize the state-of-the-art of solid-state implementations, and present the major open challenges in the realization of large-scale quantum circuits, including the design of dedicated classical control circuits and systems.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave fifth-generation (5G) systems will extensively leverage massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures to improve their link performance. These array systems will employ many power amplifiers (PAs) operating at moderate output power (Pout), e.g., 16 PAs each with +7dBm Pout [1]. The PA energy efficiency is of paramount importance in MIMO systems for improved battery life and thermal management. Due to spectrum-efficient modulations with high peak-to-average power ratios, both PA peak efficiency and power back-off (PBO) efficiency are critical. To achieve 5G Gb/s data-rates with complex modulations, envelope tracking PAs require high-speed/high-precision supply modulators, and outphasing PAs need high-speed baseband computation, both of which pose substantial challenges in practice. Although Doherty PAs support high data-rates, existing silicon mm-wave Doherty PAs exhibit very limited PBO efficiency enhancement, mainly due to inefficient Doherty power combiners and imperfect main/auxiliary PA cooperation [2,3].",

        "abstract": "Envelope tracking (ET) has become popular for enhancing battery life in mobile communication devices that employ high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) signals. Most of the published ET systems have focused either on narrow-bandwidth standards, 20MHz WLAN, or LTE [1-3]. However, as the demand for higher bandwidths and data-rates increases, so does the need for wideband ET solutions. Furthermore, to support modulations with different PAPR and transmit powers, the PA will likely require seamless switching between a continuous ET mode and a fixed-supply mode (as with a low drop-out regulator, i.e. a LDO). Hence, fast reconfigurability is needed, which most published ET systems lack. This paper describes a fully integrated, reconfigurable WLAN ET system with digital baseband in a 28nm CMOS technology for bandwidths up to 40MHz. The ET modulator directly interfaces with a battery (Vbat) and is fully integrated within a complete WLAN transceiver with RF, digital, and frequency synthesizer circuitry.",

        "abstract": "RF-PAs in 4G LTE mobile devices handle modulated signals with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) while maintaining linearity and power efficiency. Envelope-tracking technology increases the efficiency of an RF-PA by modulating its supply voltage proportionally to the RF signals. The function of an envelope-tracking supply modulator (ETSM) is to track the envelope information and provide the same output voltage to the RF-PA. Figure 2.3.1 shows a conventional hybrid ETSM, which is comprised of a linear amplifier (LA) and a hysteresis-controlled switching regulator (SWR). Since the ETSM is mainly battery-powered, an additional SWR is required. This paper presents a single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) converter that removes both SWRs, as illustrated in Fig. 2.3.2, to speed up the performance of the ETSM. In the past, a cross-regulation (CR) effect was recognized as one the most critical drawbacks in the conventional design with single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters, and numerous research papers have attempted to suppress CR [1,2]. In this paper, however, the proposed ETSM design, driven by the LA, makes effective use of the CR effect for achieving faster and efficient envelope tracking. Results show that, at a switching frequency of 2MHz, the proposed ETSM can deliver up to 2W of average output power with an efficiency of 82%.",

        "abstract": "Long-term-evolution (LTE) communication enables high data-rates but degrades the efficiency of the power amplifiers (PAs) due to high peak-to-average power ratios of transmitted signals. Envelope tracking (ET) and envelope-elimination-and-restoration (EER) techniques have been proposed to improve the PA efficiency by adapting the PA supply voltage to the envelope. Linear PAs in ET systems are mostly implemented in non-CMOS technologies for high efficiency [1]. However, the growing demand for low-cost integrated systems has motivated the use of CMOS PAs [2]. The main drawback of this is that linear CMOS PAs have poor efficiency. The high efficiency of switching PAs makes them a promising candidate in CMOS [3]. In EER systems, where switching PAs are used, the supply modulator must satisfy stringent noise and bandwidth specifications in order to recover the amplitude information of the LTE signal. Thus, it is a challenge for supply modulators to maintain high efficiency. Recently, a number of methods have been adopted to improve supply-modulator efficiency. In [1], a dual-switching topology is proposed, but it requires an additional inductor and results in an unpredictable noise spectrum. In [4], an AC-coupling topology is adopted to reduce the supply voltage of the linear amplifier. However, due to the slow response of the switching amplifier, the efficiency is still low.",

Small or pico-cell networks are required for spatial diversity and propagation-loss compensation, suggesting silicon solutions also for backhauling where the E-band is a candidate. Techniques for spectral and power efficiency are being investigated, key for capacity improvements over LTE and deployment of the large number of required cells. A transmitter power amplifier (PA), delivering near 20dBm, is a key block for power saving. With the high peak-to-average ratio of QAM modulations, PAs are operated at 5-to-8dB back-off [2], where the efficiency of reported silicon E-band PAs is in the order of a few percent only [3-5].",

        "abstract": "To meet rising demand, broadband-cellular-data providers are racing to deploy fifth generation (5G) mm-wave technology, e.g., rollout of some 28GHz-band services is intended in 2017 in the USA with ~5/1Gb/s downlink/uplink targets. Even with 64-QAM signaling, this translates to an RF bandwidth (RFBW) as large as ~800MHz. With ~100m cells and a dense network of 5G access points (APs), potential manufacturing volumes make low-cost CMOS technology attractive for both user equipment (UE) and AP devices. However, the poor Pout and linearity of CMOS power amplifiers (PAs) are a bottleneck, as ~10dB back-off is typical for meeting error-vector-magnitude (EVM) specifications. This limits communication range and PA power added efficiency (PAE), with wider RFBWs accentuating these issues further. On the other hand, sufficient element counts in the envisaged 5G phased-array modules can overcome path loss despite low Pout per PA, e.g., by combining RFICs in an AP. CMOS PAs with wideband linearity/PAE can therefore enable economical UE/AP devices to deliver 5G data-rates.",

        "abstract": "In modern communication, wideband and high-spectral-efficiency modulation results in high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), up to 8 to 10dB. Well-known PA-efficiency-enhancement techniques, such as Doherty and outphasing, offer reduced efficiency improvement beyond 6dB back-off, limiting the efficiency enhancement obtainable with high PAPR modulation. Recent works have shown that a combination of different techniques can result in improved efficiency well beyond 6dB back-off. However, these combined techniques have come at a cost of glitches due to mode-transitions, when power supply voltage or load impedance undergo large variations at critical power levels. Switching between power supply voltages causes significant glitches, which degrade the EVM and ACPR of the transmitted signal. Reasonable EVM is achieved, by reducing the average output power so that power supply switching is less frequent. A \u201cskipping window\u201d technique is proposed in the work of Tai, et al. (2012) to skip high-frequency mode-transitions reducing overall glitching. While this improves the ACPR, the efficiency is degraded since there is no enhancement during a skipped transition. In this work, the authors demonstrate the combination of the voltage-mode Doherty (VMD) and Class-G switched-capacitor power amplifier (SCPA) techniques. Together, these techniques provide efficiency peaking at both 6 and 12dB backoff over a wide bandwidth without introducing the glitches present in previous works. The Class-G VMD with integrated matching network achieves a PAE of 24% and better than -32dB EVM for 256-QAM OFDM signals.",

With 4 distinct chip configurations, the POWER9 family of chips delivers multiple options for memory ports, core thread counts, and accelerator options to address this need. The 24-core scale-out processor is implemented in 14nm SOI FinFET technology [1] and contains 8.0B transistors. The 695mm2 chip uses 17 levels of copper interconnect: 3-64nm, 2-80nm, 4-128nm, 2-256nm, 4-360nm pitch wiring for signals and 2- 2400nm pitch wiring levels for power and global clock distribution. Digital logic uses three thin-oxide transistor Vts to balance power and performance requirements, while analog and high-voltage circuits eliminated thick-oxide devices providing process simplification and cost reduction. By leveraging the FinFET's increased current per area, the base standard cell image shrunk from 18 tracks per bit in planar 22nm to 10 tracks per bit in 14nm providing additional area scaling.",

Similar to Helio X20 [1], the Deca-Core compute function contains three separate clusters of ARMv8a CPUs. The high-performance (HP) cluster is updated to incorporate the most power-efficient out-of-order Cortex-A73 CPU, operating at max frequency of 2.8GHz. In X20, the low-power (LP) and ultra-low power (ULP) clusters used Cortex-CA53 with different implementation flows, while this work achieves a +44% more power-efficient ULP solution based on the newer Cortex-CA35 CPU (Fig. 3.4.1). In addition, the LP cluster achieves a +36% more performance than ULP or +40% more power-efficiency than the HP cluster, for optimal sustainable performance/power applications including augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR).

Up-scaling of conventional 4x4 small-scale MIMO implementations to MaMi is prohibitive in-terms of flexibility, as well as area and power cost. This work discloses a 1.1mm2 128x8 MaMi baseband chip, achieving up to 12dB array and 2x7 spatial multiplexing gains. The area cost compared to previous state-of-the-art MIMO implementations [2-3], is reduced by 53% and 17% for up- and down-link, respectively. Algorithm optimizations and a highly flexible framework were evaluated on real measured channels. Extensive hardware time multiplexing lowered area cost, and leveraging on flexible FD-SOI body bias and clock gating resulted in an energy efficiency of 6.56nJ/QRD and 60pJ/b at 300Mb/s detection rate.",

        "abstract": "We report a VGA dynamic vision sensor (DVS) with a 9\u03bcm pixel, developed through a digital as well as an analog implementation. DVS systems in the literature try to increase spatial resolution up to QVGA [1-2] and data rates up to 50 million events per second (Meps) (self-acknowledged) [3], but they are still inadequate for high-performance applications such as gesture recognition, drones, automotive, etc. Moreover, the smallest reported pixel of 18.5\u03bcm is too large for economical mass production [3]. This paper reports a 640\u00d7480 VGA-resolution DVS system with a 9\u03bcm pixel pitch supporting a data rate of 300Meps for sufficient event transfer in spite of higher resolution. Maintaining acceptable pixel performance, the pixel circuitry is carefully designed and optimized using a BSI CIS process. To acquire data (i.e., pixel events) at high speed even with high resolution (e.g., VGA), a fully synthesized word-serial group address-event representation (G-AER) is implemented, which handles massive events in parallel by binding neighboring 8 pixels into a group. In addition, a 10b programmable bias generator dedicated to a DVS system provides easy controllability of pixel biases and event thresholds.",

        "abstract": "Integration and miniaturization of bio-molecular detection systems into electronic biosensors and lab-on-chip platforms is of great importance. One widely recognized application area for such devices is nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) detection, specifically, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), which relies on enzymatic processes such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase the copy number of target sequences and detecting them spectroscopically [1,2]. Here, we present a fully integrated CMOS DNA biosensor array (biochip) for clinical NAAT capable of performing multiplex (parallel) PCR in one -40\u03bcL reaction chamber using on-chip thermo-cycling (\u00b14\u00b0C sec-1 heat/cool rate), real-time amplicon-probe hybridization detection (up to target 1000 unique sequences), and solid-phase (surface) melt-curve analysis from 40 to 90\u00b0C with 0.3\u00b0C resolution. The detection modality is continuous-wave fluorescence with an effective pass-band to stop-band optical density (OD) of -3.6 using an inverse fluorophore assay [3] that requires no labeling, or sandwich probes [4] in the reaction mix. Unlike electro-analytical biochips [5], the transducer surface as well as surface chemistries of this system, are chemically and thermally stable and do not degrade during PCR thermo-cycling.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence-based time-resolved (TR) analysis techniques are fundamental and effective methods in life science and medicine. Among others, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is one of the representative measurement techniques for biomedical applications. Recently, advanced all-solid-state imaging devices for FLIM, e.g., a CCD with optional electron-multiplication (EM) readout, a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), and a TR CMOS image sensor (CIS), have been reported [1-3]. These devices can be implemented compactly in comparison with the typical FLIM systems such as a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system [4]. However, imaging devices based on the CCD or SPAD still have some issues, including the need for specialized fabrication processes, use of higher voltages, and greater circuit complexity. The recent TR CIS with two taps in a pixel [3] shows us a way to realize real-time lifetime imaging, but the two-tap CIS has a limitation that a sample's lifetime cannot be measured in real time if the sample has multi-exponential decay components. This paper presents a sub-nanosecond time-gated four-tap lock-in pixel CIS using in-pixel pulse generator (PG) for fluorescence lifetime (FLT) imaging system. To realize a real-time FLT measurement system, good low-noise performance and the capability for fast data acquisition are essential. Thus, a lateral electric field charge modulator (LEFM) implemented with in-pixel PG block, 2-stage chargetransfer technique for true correlated double sampling (CDS) operation, and multi-tap design are used for the developed lock-in pixel. Additionally, a narrow time-window (TW) generated in pixel-level PG helps to attain the high signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) FLT measurement results.",

        "abstract": "Wearable sensors are increasingly common and continue to grow more diverse in their sensing modalities, ranging from glucose to heart rate monitoring. One compelling sensing modality for wearable sensors is cumulative light exposure. For instance, reduced light exposure exacerbates depression, while high levels of sunlight exposure are well known as the primary cause of skin cancer. In order for wearable sensors to determine how much light radiation the skin is receiving, a light-to-digital converter (LDC) is needed to both measure instantaneous light intensity and record the total accumulated light energy. LDCs targeting wearable devices will have tight constraints on area (cost) and power. At the same time, the wide dynamic range of light (~106) from 0.1lx to 100klx places difficult performance requirements on the LDC. Previous LDCs integrate photodiode current and use a transimpedance amplifier followed by ADC conversion [1-2], resulting in continuous power consumption up to 100s of \u03bcW, which is not sustainable for wearable devices with small batteries. Recently, a low-power LDC based on logarithmic digital-to-resistance conversion was proposed for heart rate monitoring [3], but its input dynamic range is too small for light energy monitoring. An alternate approach converts light intensity to frequency [4], which is then measured with a frequency-to-digital converter. However, this approach consumes significant power at strong light levels as oscillation frequency increases linearly with light intensity. Also, this approach requires an accurate reference timer circuit that may not be available during sleep/standby modes common in wearable devices.",

        "abstract": "CMOS image sensors (CIS) with global shutter (GS) function are required in a variety of areas, including broadcasting, automobile, drones, and surveillance applications. For these applications, GS CISs are needed to avoid rolling shutter (RS) distortion. These applications also benefit from the high image quality and high frame rates of GS CISs [1-3]. To realize a GS CIS, a memory structure and additional MOS transistors are necessary. Due to this increase in the number of components, photodiode area is restricted. Therefore, sensor performance (e.g., noise, sensitivity, and saturation) of GS CISs has generally remained inferior to that of RS sensors. To break down this constraint, we introduce a multiple-accumulation shutter technique for GS CISs. Furthermore, we combine the column single-slope ADCs with dual-gain amplifiers (SSDG-ADC) [4] to implement this technique effectively, while also achieving low power consumption and a high frame rate.",

In addition to this technical problem, the demands for high quality in dark situations and for movies are increasing. Frame-level signal processing can solve these problems, but previous generations of CIS could not achieve both high-speed readout and accessible I/F speed.

        "abstract": "The use of infrared (IR) imaging to view scenes otherwise invisible to the human eye, simultaneously with visible-spectrum imaging, is increasingly of interest for various applications for such as in-vehicle, surveillance, and agricultural security cameras. The loss of spatial resolution in conventional RGB-IR sensors causes aliasing, because IR pixels are segmented within the provided effective pixel area [1,2]. 3-D stacking of photodiode arrays has been reported as another strategy for RGB-IR capture [3]; however, the need for bonding accuracy limits pixel size. Silicon's weak IR light absorptivity also results in relatively lower IR sensitivity on the part of these image sensors.",

        "abstract": "In the past several years, CMOS image sensors (CISs) with sub-single-electron noise level, particularly, deep sub-electron read noise (less than 0.5e-rms), have been reported. Such an ultra-low noise level is realized with a reduced floating diffusion (FD) node capacitance for attaining the high pixel conversion gain (CG) [1,2], and a high-gain readout circuitry with noise-reduction capabilities [3,4]. Recently, a reset-gate-less (RGL) CMOS image sensor has been reported [5]. It shows an excellent read noise performance using an optimized pixel structure for high CG and high-gain column ADC with multiple sampling. In this technique, however, a very high pulsed voltage of approximately 25V for the FD reset is essential to cause a punch-through effect. It is not suitable for image sensors with high pixel resolution and high-speed signal readout. This paper presents a low read noise 0.5Mpixel RGL-pixel CMOS image sensor at 32Hz sensor operation with a bootstrapping reset method. The CIS does not have a reset gate (RG) to eliminate the parasitic coupling capacitance between RG and FD, as in [5], but the FD reset is done by a capacitive coupling between the FD and the source follower output. This technique, named \u201cbootstrapping reset,\u201d does not need a high supply voltage for FD resetting, and high-speed rowby-row resetting is realized while achieving raster-scan readout.",

        "abstract": "Feedback after the output filter has long been a desired feature for high-power switching (Class-D) amplifiers, as it mitigates the influence of the LC filter components on the frequency transfer function and on linearity, enabling lower component costs. However, it requires compensation of the LC filter to maintain loop stability. In the analog domain, this is difficult to combine with high loop-gain, as the design has to cope with variability in both the LC filter and in the loop-filter. In [1], multiple analog feedback loop-filters from before and after the output filter have been employed, but the loop-gain of the outer loop is only ~10dB at 20kHz. Alternatively, digital filters have no variability in their coefficients and are well suited for programmable compensation of the output filter, optionally even adaptive. In [2] feasibility is shown of a single digital loop with full global feedback. However, to achieve this, a costly commercially available ADC with 2.5MHz bandwidth and 950mW power consumption was required, a drawback that so far has prevented further adoption. In this paper we present a 5-channel Class-D amplifier with integrated low-latency delta-sigma (\u0394\u03a3) ADCs, each consuming only 30mW, for digital feedback after the output filter. With this system, more than 50dB loop-gain is obtained. THD+N is 0.004% over the full audio band, which is at least 10\u00d7 better than [1] where data is only given at 1kHz.",

        "abstract": "As the portable device market tries to enhance user experience, high-power audio systems with boosted supply voltage have been the main design focus recently. Several past works have addressed issues related to boosted supply voltages [1,2]. Nevertheless, the power stage retained the classical H-bridge structure in the previous works, which resulted in aggravated electromagnetic interference (EMI) from high switching amplitude and poor efficiency due to voltage boosting. The use of multi-level pulse-width modulation (PWM) shown in Fig. 5.2.1 can naturally eliminate the complications caused by high supply voltages. Since the audio signal has a high crest factor, a multi-level Class-D amplifier draws most power directly from a low-voltage battery source, which in turn improves the power efficiency significantly [3]. Spread spectrum techniques prevent energy localization in the power spectral density [2]. Nevertheless, the diffusion of switching harmonics into the nearby frequencies complicates EMI management. However, the multi-level switching scheme suppresses EMI by reducing the switching amplitude without spreading the energy spectrum [4]. In this work, a new folded-PWM (FPWM) architecture implementing a multi-level H-bridge topology is presented.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes (WSN) in IoT applications (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, BLE) rely on heavily duty-cycling the wireless transceivers to reduce the overall system power consumption [1]. This requires swift start-up behavior of the transceiver. The crystal oscillator (XO) generates a stable reference clock for the PLL to synthesize a carrier and to derive clocks for all other parts of the transceiver SoC, e.g., ADC and the digital baseband. The typical start-up time (Ts) of an XO is relatively long (~ms) due to a high quality factor of the crystal quartz. This leads to a significant (up to 30%) power overhead for a highly duty-cycled transceiver with a short packet format, e.g., the packet length is as short as 128\u03bcs in BLE (Fig. 5.3.1). A reduction of Ts of the XO is necessary, at the same time, the power overhead to enable a fast start-up should be minimized in order to reduce the overall energy consumption (Fig. 5.3.1).",

        "abstract": "Many sensing applications require a high-resolution frequency measurement. These applications include measurement of pressure, acceleration and eddy-current sensing. In these applications the sensor is part of an oscillator circuit where the physical quantity being measured is represented by a frequency. In most of these applications the supply current is dictated by the SNR requirements, therefore in order to save power, power cycling is used with a minimum conversion time. For an accurate frequency measurement this conversion time is limited by the time resolution and the accumulated jitter of the reference clock [1]. In this paper a ring oscillator with less than 3ns peak-to-peak accumulated jitter over a 1ms time window is presented. A high time resolution of 770ps is obtained by reading the state of the individual inverters of the ring oscillator. The accumulated jitter is 20 times smaller than the state of the art on-chip oscillators [2-4] and enables us to detect very small changes in physical quantities like distance, pressure, mass etc.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of wearable and implantable technologies, there has been growing demand on development of key enabling circuits for ultra-low-power sensor interface SoCs. As a reference-frequency generation block for clock management of the overall system, the relaxation oscillator has been widely adopted since it can provide a controllable and well-defined untrimmed frequency with low-cost circuits. In the past decade, the major goal in the design of the relaxation oscillators has been the improvement of phase-noise figure-of-merit (FOM) closer to the fundamental limit of 169dBc/Hz [1]. There have been feedback approaches to internally generate reference voltages for comparison, hence compensating the comparator circuit delay [2-4]. Since the delay compensation relies on the feedback operation, power consumption by analog circuits to meet the required bandwidth of the feedback loop eventually limits FOM. Recently, a swing-boosted differential scheme was proposed to reduce the effect of comparator noise by boosting the signal slope at the comparator input, demonstrating an FOM of over 160dBc/Hz [5]. However, the boosted voltage swing can increase stress on the input transistors of the comparator. In addition, a high-speed comparator is also needed to reduce the effect of the circuit delay on the output frequency. While most of previous works achieved good FOMs with MHz oscillators, implementation of low-frequency relaxation oscillators presents additional challenges since it requires excessive area for RC and power consumption by analog circuits with leakage not scaled down along with the output frequency.",

        "abstract": "RC Relaxation Oscillators (RxO) are attractive for integrated clock sources compared to LC and ring oscillators (RO), as LC oscillators pose integration challenges and RO designs have limited voltage and temperature (V-T) stability. RxOs generate a clock whose time period (TP) depends only on the timing resistor (R) and capacitor (C). Ideally, TP is independent of V-T; however, most RxOs use a reference voltage (VREF) against which the voltage of C (Vc) is compared. Generating a V-T-independent VREF is non-trivial and causes variations in RxO frequency. A common approach is the use of VDD-independent current sources or band-gap or device-Vt-based VREF. The former are generally high-power options while the latter is subject to process and V-T variations. A correct-by-design approach was adopted in demonstrating VDD-independent operation by cancelling variations through differential sampling of VDD. Further, the power overhead of a supply-independent VREF is overcome by exploiting differential-integrator virtual ground. However, 4V2/R power in the RC tank and high-power VCO increase the energy/cycle.",

Capacitors have excellent matching and temperature drift, which has a positive impact on offset/gain errors and their drift. They also offer a high input impedance at low frequencies and rail-to-rail operation, which makes them very suitable to interface with different types of sensors.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-low-power (ULP) sensor technologies for the future internet of things have presented challenges in ULP implementation of reference circuits while keeping traditional requirements of stable performance. For voltage reference circuits, as an essential block in SoCs to generate various internal supply voltages, the bandgap voltage-reference (BGVR) scheme has been widely used since it provides a well-defined value with strong immunity to process/voltage/temperature variations. Nanowatt-consuming BGVR circuits have been recently proposed using a capacitor network and a leakage-based proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) circuit. On the other hand, the current reference circuit that is required to set internal bias current still presents difficulties in achieving both stable performance and ULP consumption. The general approach to building a current reference is to use a BGVR with additional resistors for V-to-I conversion. Though it can provide a well-defined stable current reference, it also requires excessively large resistance for ULP consumption. Another approach is a CMOS-based current reference circuit that tries to make the exponential term in the subthreshold current equation constant or temperature-independent, hence reducing process and temperature dependencies. While CMOS reference circuits have achieved ULP implementations, the current is still determined by a number of process and design parameters, resulting in large sensitivity to process variations. This paper presents a sub-10nW bandgap-reference (BGR) circuit that implements both voltage and current references in one circuit. The BGR circuit is implemented with a 0.18\u03bcm CMOS process and generates voltage and a current references of 1.238V and 6.64nA while consuming 9.3nW. The voltage and current references show standard deviations of 0.43% and 1.19% with temperature coefficients of 26ppm/\u00b0C and 283ppm/\u00b0C, respectively.",

The paper presents an ultra-low-power, compact and accurate temperature sensor without trimming for the local heat monitors of SOCs. The approach of the dynamic-distributing-bias temperature sensor efficiently reduces the power consumption and chip area simultaneously with accurate digital outputs. The overall area of the circuit is 0.00946mm2, which shows larger than 2\u00d7 area reduction compared with the prior art [1-3].

        "abstract": "The demand for ultra-high speed transceivers continues to explode, and while the data-rate for high-speed I/O standards has increased accordingly, the historically constant or even decreasing power budgets available for the transceivers push these designs to be extremely energy efficient. To begin addressing this need, recently published NRZ transceivers operating up to 56.5Gb/s with a 1-tap DFE and/or CTLE [1,2] in 28-40nm CMOS processes have been demonstrated for <;20dB loss channels with energy efficiencies ranging from 4.4 to 11.96pJ/b. In order to support channels with higher losses, the half-rate 65nm receiver front-end design described in [3] includes a 3-tap DFE, a 2-tap FFE, and a CTLE at ~2.88pJ/b, but neither closed-loop equalizer adaptation nor clock and data recovery were demonstrated. Closing these loops is especially critical in such an interleaved architecture, since at these data-rates each interleaved datapath can result in a noticeably different overall channel response (ISI), and the need for closed-loop CDR is self-evident. This paper therefore presents a fully adaptive 60Gb/s transceiver, supporting >20dB channel loss, implemented in a 65nm CMOS technology (Fig. 6.2.1). The full transceiver (including baud-rate CDR) achieves 60Gb/s and 4.8pJ/b energy efficiency over a 0.7m Twinax cable.",

The CEI-56G-VSR-PAM4 standard [1] defines PAM-4 signaling at 56Gb/s targeting chip-to-module interconnect. Figure 6.3.1 shows the measured S21 of a channel resembling such interconnects and the corresponding single-pulse response after TX-FIR and RX CTLE. Although the S21 is merely ~10dB at 14GHz, the single-pulse response exhibits significant reflections from impedance discontinuities, mainly between package and PCB traces. These reflections are detrimental to PAM-4 signaling and cannot be equalized effectively by RX CTLE and/or a few taps of TX feed-forward equalization. This paper presents the design of a PAM-4 receiver using 10-tap direct decision-feedback equalization (DFE) targeting such VSR channels.",

        "abstract": "Electrical link migration requires serial interfaces to operate at increasing data rates. Despite the fact that most standards still employ NRZ, practical signal integrity constraints demand PAM-4 modulation, especially for some interconnect applications and low-loss profiles [1]. Nevertheless, compared to NRZ, the design of high-speed PAM-4 transmitters entails several challenges. Achieving high linearity without reducing the output amplitude is key to preserve high SNR, which is tightened by the intrinsic 1/3 eye amplitude reduction. Moreover, transitions between non-adjacent levels reduce horizontal eye openings, demanding wide bandwidth and tight timing constraints. In light of the above issues, pushing the transmitter to high data-rates while maintaining signal integrity and energy efficiency is challenging. In fact, published PAM-4 transmitters [2-5] do not meet the CEI-56G-PAM4 standard [1], requiring up to 56Gb/s and 4-taps of feedforward equalization (FFE). To reach the target, improvements on both the architecture and the circuit side are required. A serializer architecture is presented in this paper. To save power, clocking signals are generated and distributed at quarter-rate, but the last stage employs 2:1 multiplexers (MUXs) driven by half-rate clocks generated locally to overcome the speed limitation of 4:1 MUXs. Moreover, a new current-mode driver allows high swing and good linearity by raising the power supply without compromising speed and reliability, and a double T-coil splits transistors and ESD parasitics to meet the bandwidth requirements for the target data rate.",

        "abstract": "As data rates in electrical links rise to 56Gb/s, standards are gravitating towards PAM-4 modulation to achieve higher spectral efficiency. Such approaches are not without drawbacks, as PAM-4 signaling results in reduced vertical margins as compared to NRZ. This makes data recovery more susceptible to residual, or uncompensated, intersymbol interference (ISI) when the PAM-4 waveform is sampled by the receiver. To overcome this, existing standards such as OIF CEI 56Gb/s very short reach (VSR) require forward error correction to meet the target link BER of 1E-15. This comes at the expense of higher latency, which is undesirable for chip-to-chip VSR links in compute applications. Therefore, different channel equalization strategies should be considered for PAM-4 electrical links. Employing \u00bd-UI (T/2) tap delays in an FFE extends the filter bandwidth as compared to baud- or T-spaced taps [1], resulting in improved timing margins and lower residual ISI for 56Gb/s PAM-4 data sent across VSR channels. While T/2-spaced FFEs have been reported in optical receivers for dispersion compensation [2], the analog delay techniques used are not conducive to designing dense I/O and cannot support a wide range of data rates. This work demonstrates a 56Gb/s PAM-4 transmitter with a T/2-spaced FFE using high-speed clocking techniques to produce well-controlled tap delays that are data-rate agile. The transmitter also supports T-spaced tap delays, ensuring compatibility with existing standards.",

        "abstract": "Baud-rate clock and data recovery circuits (CDRs) are becoming more prevalent in high-speed receiver designs as they offer lower power consumption by sampling the received data only once per UI [1,2]. This reduces the number of front-end comparators and clock distribution networks [1]. However, current baud-rate CDRs require an external reference clock [1,2], adding to the system complexity in pin count and clock generation. While frequency detectors (FDs) allow CDR designs to operate without a reference clock and across a wide capture range [3-5], current FDs are not designed for baud-rate CDRs. As well, current FDs rely on sharp data edges and are not designed for significant ISI caused by channel loss at high data rates [3-5]. This work presents a reference-less baud-rate CDR that operates from 22.5Gb/s to 32Gb/s with channel loss up to -14.8dB at Nyquist. An FD scheme is proposed that automatically controls an adjustable PD to correct any frequency error. This eliminates the need for a separate frequency acquisition loop in the CDR. The CDR, with a CTLE and a 1-tap DFE, is fabricated in 28nm CMOS. The entire receiver consumes 3.2pJ/b at 32Gb/s PRBS-31.",

        "abstract": "As we move to higher data rates, the performance of clock and data recovery (CDR) circuits becomes increasingly important in maintaining low bit error rates (BER) in wireline links. Digital CDRs are popular in part for their robustness, but their use of bang-bang phase detectors (BB-PD) makes their performance sensitive to changes in jitter caused by PVT variations, crosstalk or power supply noise. This is because the gain of a BB-PD depends on the CDR input jitter, causing the loop gain of the CDR to change if the jitter magnitude or spectrum varies. This problem is illustrated in Fig. 6.7.1 where small jitter leads to excessive loop gain and hence to an underdamped behaviour in the CDR jitter tolerance (JTOL), while large jitter leads to insufficient loop gain and hence to low overall JTOL. To prevent this, we propose a CDR with an adaptive loop gain, KG, as shown in Fig. 6.7.1.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation mobile technology (5G) aims to provide an improved experience through higher data-rates, lower latency, and improved link robustness. Millimeter-wave phased arrays offer a path to support multiple users at high data-rates using high-bandwidth directional links between the base station and mobile devices. To realize this vision, a phased-array-based pico-cell must support a large number of precisely controlled beams, yet be compact and power efficient. These system goals have significant mm-wave radio interface implications, including scalability of the RFIC+antenna-array solution, increase in the number of concurrent beams by supporting dual polarization, precise beam steering, and high output power without sacrificing TX power efficiency. Packaged Si-based phased arrays [1-3] with nonconcurrent dual-polarized TX and RX operation [2,3], concurrent dual-polarized RX operation [3] and multi-IC scaling [3,4] have been demonstrated. However, support for concurrent dual-polarized operation in both RX and TX remains unaddressed, and high output power comes at the cost of power consumption, cooling complexity and increased size. The RFIC reported here addresses these challenges. It supports concurrent and independent dual-polarized operation in TX and RX modes, and is compatible with a volume-efficient, scaled, antenna-in-package array. A new TX/RX switch at the shared antenna interface enables high output power without sacrificing TX efficiency, and a t-line-based phase shifter achieves <;1\u00b0 RMS error and <;5\u00b0 phase steps for precise beam control.",

        "abstract": "The demand of higher data-rates for mobile communication has driven the LTE standard to adopt methods to increase channel bandwidth by Carrier Aggregation (CA), this is known as LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). Due to regional spectrum allocation, these carriers can be inter-band, or intra-band with contiguous (CCA) or non-contiguous (NCCA) channels. The band combinations create a major challenge for an LTE-A transceiver (TRX) in dealing with the intermodulation (IM) of aggregated channels. These IM sources include fundamental and harmonics of LOs, VCOs, and the transmitter (TX) modulated signals. In addition, when multiple receivers (RXs) and synthesizers (SXs) are needed to support CA, power consumption becomes a key challenge. This work describes an adaptive RX that can adjust trade-offs between power consumption and RX performance, allowing significant power reduction under normal field conditions. Additionally several techniques are described for mitigation of CA IM spurs.",

        "abstract": "Enabling long range (>10m) wireless communication in non-line-of sight (NLOS) scenarios would dramatically expand the application space and usability of mm-scale wireless sensor nodes. The major technical challenges posed by a mm-scale form-factor are poor antenna efficiency and the small instantaneous current limit (~10s of \u03bcA) of thin-film batteries. We address these challenges in several ways: 1) We found that a magnetic dipole antenna achieves better efficiency at an electrically-small size than an electric dipole, when the antennas are resonated with off-chip lumped components. In addition, the high impedance of electrically-small electric dipoles (~4k\u03a9 compared to 10\u03a9 for the magnetic antenna) requires an impractically large off-chip inductor to resonate. 2) By simultaneously considering the magnetic dipole efficiency, frequency-dependent path-loss, and wall penetration loss, we found that a 915MHz carrier frequency is optimal for a 3\u00d73\u00d73mm3 sensor node in NLOS asymmetric communication with a gateway. This is despite the resulting low antenna efficiency (0.21%) which typically drives mm-scale radios to operate at \u226b1GHz frequency [1]. 3) In transmit (TX) mode, instead of using a PA and PLL, we utilize a cross-coupled driver to resonate the magnetic antenna at 915MHz with a quality factor (Q) of 110 in order to reduce overall power consumption. 4) In receive (RX) mode, we propose an approach of reusing the cross-coupled driver in a non-oscillating mode to raise the Q of the resonant tank to 300, resulting in 49dB voltage gain at 43\u03bcW, thereby replacing a power-hungry LNA and bulky off-chip filter. 5) A sparse pulse-position modulation (PPM) combined with a sensor-initiation communication protocol [2] shifts the power-hungry calibration of frequency offset to the gateway, enabling crystal-free radio design- The complete radio, including the transceiver IC, a 3D antenna, off-chip capacitors, a processor, a power management unit (PMU) and memory, is integrated within a 3\u00d73\u00d73mm3 sensor node, demonstrating stand-alone bi-directional 20m NLOS wireless communication with variable data rates of 30b/s to 30.3kb/s for TX and 7.8kb/s to 62.5kb/s for RX. The transmitter generates -26.9 dBm equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) consuming 2mW power and the receiver has a sensitivity of -93dBm consuming 1.85mW.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-narrow-band (UNB) signaling is an enabling technology for low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks for the \u201cInternet-of-Things\u201d. Indeed, UNB signaling, based on spectrally efficient modulations such as DBPSK, simultaneously optimizes network capacity while maximizing the communication link budget. However, UNB signaling poses many technical challenges. In the receiver, carrier frequency offsets (CFO) can shift the desired signal from the expected channel. In the transmitter, the difficulty resides in generating the modulated signal with the required spectral purity. This work presents an 850-to-920 MHz RF transceiver dedicated to UNB communication systems employing the DBPSK/GFSK modulations. The receiver is resistant to CFO offsets and drifts of \u00b175Hz (i.e. 150% of the 100Hz channel) and 35Hz/s, respectively, with only 1dB sensitivity loss, thus allowing the circuit to function without a TCXO. In DBPSK 100b/s transmission mode, an error vector magnitude (EVM) better than 5% is measured for output powers up to 10dBm.",

        "abstract": "To facilitate the ubiquitous deployment of wireless sensors for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, highly integrated ultra-low-power (ULP) RF transceivers are essential, and numerous solutions have been proposed. These architectures address the less-stringent Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) standard, which depends on long intervals between advertising events to shorten the duty cycle of active operation, and have sacrificed RF performance like TX output level, sensitivity and blocking margins for ULP. Poorer sensitivity and low TX output level will decrease the coverage of IoT devices, and increased susceptibility to interferences will reduce the effectiveness of duty-cycling in BLE. Both cases will increase overall power consumption. On the other hand, conventional BT transceivers [1,2] rely on external RF components or large integrated passive devices (IPD) to deliver high RF performances at the expense of significantly higher DC power. This paper discloses a BT/BLE transceiver in a system-on-chip (SoC) to overcome these restrictions. The transceiver integrates a tunable RF bandpass filter (BPF) and co-matching network to help the RX achieve large blocking margins while withstanding +8dBm TX output level. The RX utilizes a current-reuse RF front-end to increase sensitivity and ACI margins with ULP. The direct-conversion transmitter (DCT) implements a Class-AB push-pull PA that reduces its 2nd-harmonic (HD2) component to <;-58dBc without any calibration, thus reducing the overall SX current consumption and simplifying the RF BPF design.",

        "abstract": "Radar sensors find use in a wide range of applications. Impulse radars operating below 10GHz offer opportunities in applications including non-contact vital signs monitoring, such as breathing and heart rate, presence detection, and ranging. However, the wide instantaneous bandwidth incurs a power penalty from the ADC, calling for unconventional receiver (RX) architectures. In practical use, the received power from narrowband interferimpulseers, such as 802.11, can be much larger than the echo from the targets, requiring an unnecessarily large RX dynamic range. In this paper we report an impulse radar SoC, featuring a transmitter (TX) that complies with regulations for unlicensed operation, 1b direct RF sampling, and RF interference rejection. The system is self-contained, including power management and clock generation functions, and requires only an external crystal and antennas to operate.",

Circuit-level SCA countermeasures to achieve data-independent supply current patterns via implementation of crypto engines using non-conventional logic (complemented or charge recovery) and local switched-capacitor-based supply current equalization have been demonstrated. The feasibility of using bandwidth-limited integrated low dropout regulators, multi-phase switched-capacitor VRs with phase-randomization and integrated inductive voltage regulators (IVR) to enhance PSCA resistance have been explored before via simulation studies. In this paper, we demonstrate improved PSCA resistance offered by an on-die all-digital high-frequency IVR in 130nm CMOS for a standard (unprotected) 128b Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) core designed in static CMOS logic. The IVR features a configurable digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a digital discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) controller, and a loop randomization (LR) block, all of which are utilized to enhance PSCA resistance with minimal power/performance/area overheads, while maintaining adequate local voltage regulation and transient performance.",

CMOS TRNGs typically exploit device-level noise, such as thermal or flicker noise to generate random bits [2]. Among various types of CMOS TRNGs, the meta-stability-based TRNG is known to have very high throughput for random bit generation, but it requires sophisticated control and calibration circuits to suppress bias [6]. Another popular type is the ring oscillator (RO)-based TRNG, which utilizes timing jitter [1-5]. Relatively simple circuits make it an attractive option, but there remains a need to improve the tolerance against power supply attacks and process/environmental variations [3]. Recently, selective use of a certain set of inverter chains based on pre-tuning was proposed to mitigate process variation effects [2].",

Variability tolerance is a key design challenge when designing such PLLs in an advanced CMOS technology. Environmental variations, such as mismatch, process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) perturb device characteristics and result in performance changes, such as DCO gain and noise. Another consideration is the wide range of operating modes in which modern digital circuits (e.g., processors) operate. For instance, a clock generator for a processor may produce a range of frequencies from tens of MHz to several GHz depending on required processor performance. In low-frequency mode, the power consumption is more pronounced than the noise. Therefore, we seek to design a PLL that is both insensitive to environmental variations, as well as reconfigurable to changing noise and power specifications.",

        "abstract": "Ring oscillator (RO)-based clock multipliers are traditionally used for clocking digital systems such as processors. While they are most commonly implemented using PLLs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to design them in a power efficient manner, as their jitter requirements grow more stringent. Recognizing that the main limitation of PLLs arises from limited RO noise suppression bandwidth (NBW = FREF/10), multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) that suppress noise by replacing a RO's noisy edge with a clean reference clock edge have gained prominence [1-3]. Such an edge replacement operation suppresses RO noise with an increased NBW of about FREF/4 [1]. However, imperfections of edge replacement logic have limited the output frequency of MDLLs [1, 2] or degraded their jitter performance at frequencies beyond 2.5GHz [3]. Furthermore, MDLLs are susceptible to transistor non-idealities and require elaborate analog calibration schemes that are prone to circuit imperfections [2, 3]. In contrast to PLLs and MDLLs, injection-locked clock multipliers (ILCMs) lock RO frequency to an integer multiple (N) of FREF by injecting narrow pulses at FREF into the RO whose free running frequency is about NF REF [4]. Because ILCMs do not require logic that needs to adhere to stringent timing requirements (like MDLLs) they are better suited for generating high frequencies. However, their jitter performance is limited by: (i) smaller NBW (\u2248 FREF/6) compared to MDLLs, (ii) limited suppression of RO flicker noise due to their Type-I response, and (iii) the need for RO free running frequency, FFR, to be close to NFREF for maintaining low jitter performance across voltage and temperature. These factors limit the multiplication factor (usually to less than 10) and degrade power efficiency [4,5]. In this paper, we present an ILCM architecture that achieves a NBW of close to FR- F/3 with a jitter of 335fsrms at 5GHz, while operating with FREF = 125MHz and consuming 5.3mW.",

        "abstract": "There continue to be efforts to develop methodologies for fully automated digital design of key analog building blocks. The phase-locked loop (PLL) is a block for which an all-digital implementation has been sought recently. There have been several approaches for fully synthesized digital PLLs [1-4] via gate-level implementation of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and a time-to-digital converter (TDC). Though automated layout has been achieved, the lock-range and phase-noise performance are subject to process variations. Critical performance-limiting blocks, such as the TDC and DCO, should be carefully designed with analog circuit simulators, diluting the inherent benefits of digital design. This work presents a highly programmable and synthesizable TDC- and DCO-less fractional-N PLL architecture, employing a phase-locked direct-digital synthesizer (PLDDS) driven by a free-running oscillator. The PLDDS design is specified entirely in a register-transfer level (RTL) hardware-description language (HDL) without any need for analog simulation.",

Also featured are a low-power MEMs gyroscope readout, and a low-noise MEMs microphone. An energy-efficient CMOS IC readout with low noise performance (<10nV/\u221aHz) is reported.

        "abstract": "Temperature sensors are often used for the temperature compensation of frequency references [1-5]. High resolution and energy efficiency are then critical requirements, the former to minimize jitter and the latter to minimize power dissipation in a given conversion time. A MEMS-resonator-based sensor meets both criteria [1], but requires two resonators. In principle, resistor-based sensors also meet these criteria, and are CMOS compatible, but previous designs have been limited by the power dissipation [2-4] or 1/f noise [6] of their readout electronics. This paper describes a CMOS temperature sensor that digitizes the temperature-dependent phase shift of an RC filter. It achieves 410\u03bcKrms resolution in a 5ms conversion time, while consuming only 160\u03bcW. This corresponds to a resolution FOM of 0.13pJ\u00b7K2, a 5\u00d7 improvement on previous CMOS sensors [6].",

        "abstract": "Thermal sensing is one of the most commonly desired features in IoT devices to monitor either environmental or system/chip conditions. An accurate temperature sensor usually requires carefully calibrated, high-accuracy ADCs, which prevents their use in ultra-low-power sensor nodes. In some sensing architectures, a highly accurate timing reference can replace the ADC [1]. With this in mind, we observe that almost all IoT systems incorporate a high-accuracy timing source (real-time clock, RTC) for time synchronization, data recording, and radio communication. Typically, these RTCs employ crystal or MEMS-based oscillators, or RC oscillators in extremely small form factor devices. We therefore propose to build a temperature sensor that uses a system's core RTC as a timing reference to minimize power/area overhead. We also show a fully integrated sensor that includes an RC-based timing circuit for systems that might not have a timing source.",

        "abstract": "MEMS gyroscopes are used in closed-loop configuration (CL) to satisfy the demand for high-performance and stable inertial sensors [1]. Due to the higher complexity and power consumption compared to open-loop solutions, these systems have usually been unsuitable for mobile battery-driven devices, e.g., for indoor navigation. Recently, the utilization of CT-\u0394\u03a3M for the readout of gyroscopes has shown to be a promising approach for reduced power consumption in a CL system [2]. In general, an accurate matching of the electrical BPF [2] to the drive and sense resonance frequencies of the sensor [3] is a prerequisite for maximizing SNR. For systems with drive frequencies fd of some tens of kHz and with a typical angular rate bandwidth of BW=50Hz, the frequency matching needs to be as precise as BW/fd<;0.5%. However, the frequency variation of CT BPFs in CT-\u0394\u03a3M over PVT is large compared to DT circuits. This paper presents a fully integrated frequency tuning circuit that is based on noise observation at the input of the electrical BPF in an electromechanical CT-\u0394\u03a3M. It works in the background during normal operation, achieving a precision better than 0.25% fd and featuring a considerably lower power of 27\u03bcW and lower area of 0.06mm2 than competing approaches (see Fig. 9.4.6).",

The consumer market is demanding improved quality for audio recording, while also being capable of suppressing high-energy disturbers, e.g., wind noise. The challenge is to achieve both high DR and SNR at low supply voltages that limit signal swing. Signal levels are expressed in dB Sound-Pressure-Level (dB SPL) with respect to the human hearing threshold at a sound pressure of 20\u03bcPa corresponding to 0dB SPL. Today's mass-market MEMS digital microphone solutions typically process sound up to 120dB SPL.",

        "abstract": "As the demand for interactive displays continues to increase, capacitive touch systems (CTSs) with stylus-based drawing have become indispensable [1-4]. Passive styli are widely used because of their low-cost implementation, but have low SNR and limited drawing expressions [1]. Active styli have gained interest to solve these problems [4]. The pressure of an active stylus can be expressed using a pressure-to-capacitance transducer [3,4], but the tilt angle has not been reported yet. In addition, analog front-end (AFE) ICs with high frame rates are in demand in response to the fast movements of finger and active styli. Conventional AFE ICs adopt a parallel driving method (PDM) to achieve high SNR, but suffer from low frame rates because the number of rows and columns of the driving matrix increases with the number of TX electrodes [3]. In this paper, an AFE IC with high frame rate using a multiple-frequency driving method (MFDM) is proposed for response to fast movements of fingers and active styli, while expressing both the pressure and tilt angle of the active stylus.",

        "abstract": "Capacitive touch sensors are essential for the user interfaces of smartphones and tablet PCs. Large touch-screen panels (TSPs) require high-quality touch features, resulting in an increased number of sensing channels as well as a reduction of sensing capacitance due to fine-pitch arrangements. Therefore, touch-sensor ICs demand high resolution, low power and high efficiency. State-of-the-art capacitive touch sensors [1-6] mostly rely on capacitive charge amplifiers as analog front-ends (AFEs), which convert the capacitor change into a voltage signal and often limit the system noise figure, thus consuming most of the power. This paper presents a 120fps 28\u00d750 touch sensor that achieves 41.7dB SNR for 1mm-\u03c6 stylus, while consuming 6.9mW, which results in an energy efficiency of 0.41nJ/step, for a >4\u00d7 improvement compared to state-of-the-art stylus touch sensors (see Fig. 9.7.6). This is achieved by a current-driven \u0394\u03a3 ADC architecture, which implements charge balancing between a reference charge and a differential current from adjacent channels, directly interfacing with 2nd-order \u0394\u03a3 modulators. An area-efficient sinc2 filter, as a decimation filter, enables full parallel implementation of the 2nd-order \u0394\u03a3 ADCs, providing sufficient suppression of interference signals. In contrast to previous works, the current-driven \u0394\u03a3 ADC only needs to digitize small differential currents, which relaxes requirements of the front-end amplifier, resulting in a large power reduction.",

        "abstract": "Displacement sensing with sub-nanometer resolution is required in advanced metrology and high-tech industry, e.g., to measure the lens position in wafer scanners. Linear encoders and interferometers are often used for this purpose, but they are bulky and costly. Capacitive sensors [1], though compact, are sensitive to environment and require electrical access to the target. Eddy-current sensors (ECSs) do not have these disadvantages, but their resolution and stability are limited by the skin-effect [2-5]. For sub-nm measurements, this can be alleviated by using excitation frequencies >100MHz. This calls for stable flat sensing coils (to minimize parasitics) in close proximity to the ECS interface, whose power dissipation must then be low enough to avoid self-heating and displacement errors due to thermal expansion [2,6].",

With the current intake of many modern-day applications growing each new process generation, the Power Delivery Network (PDN) losses have increased as well. By integrating a DC-DC converter together with the load, part of the required voltage conversion can be realized on-chip, and the current intake, together with the PDN losses, can thus ideally be reduced by its Voltage Conversion Ratio (VCR). In order to be viable, though, the converter must 1) have a high efficiency and VCR such that its losses are smaller than the reduction of PDN losses, 2) limit the area overhead by achieving high power density and 3) rely only on commonly available devices to enable wide-spread use.",

        "abstract": "The number of mobile device users increases every year. Each mobile device is usually equipped with a Li-ion battery having voltage that varies from a minimum of 2.7V to a maximum of 4.2V. Therefore, as the battery voltage decreases with time, a DC-DC converter is required for a regulated supply lower or higher than the battery voltage. A simple buck converter is not suited for this case, since step-up conversion is not available [1]. Instead, a non-inverting buck-boost converter can be a solution over the entire range of the battery voltage [1-4]. Many research studies related to buck-boost converters operated on Li-ion batteries set the target output voltage at around 3.4V [3,4]. Since Li-ion batteries have a wide plateau from 3.6V to 3.8V and a small energy storage below the plateau, DC-DC converters are generally operated on step-down mode at most of the battery voltage range, as shown in Fig. 10.4.1 top. Notwithstanding, step-up conversion is also required for extracting the energy below the plateau even if it is a small amount in the battery. Therefore, in DC-DC converters, it is critical to maintain high efficiency over the whole range of the battery voltage when it operates on both step-down and step-up modes to prolong the battery usage effectively. However, if the conventional buck-boost topology of Fig. 10.4.1 bottom-left is used for step-up and step-down purposes, there are always two switches (S1 and S3) conducting in the main current path through the inductor. Thus, the switches become large in size to minimize the conduction loss. As the switching loss also increases when the switch size is larger, the efficiency of this structure is usually lower than that of the simple buck (or boost) converter [1]. In this respect, this paper proposes a topology named a flying-capacitor buck-boost (FCBB) converter suitable for such an application by obtaining both step-up and step-down operations with high efficiency throughout the whole rang- of the battery voltage.",

        "abstract": "Advanced CMOS devices below 28nm allow supply voltages lower than 1V. For applications with higher input voltage in such devices, stacked MOSFET structures with a three-level technology are commonly employed. The stacked structure can also reduce the output voltage ripple substantially. A three-level single-inductor triple-output (SITO) converter was shown here and also compares the transient response with the SITO converter without the three-level technique. The three-level topology applies three different voltages, Vin 1/2Vin and VSS, to the node VX. The operation mode is determined by the duty cycle, i.e., the node Vx swings between 1/2Vin and VSS when duty cycle (D <; 0.5), and between 1/2Vin and Vin, otherwise (D>0.5). In state-of-the-art , the key issue of the three-level topology is how to balance the cross voltage of flying capacitor CFLY at the point of 1/2Vin. In general, the restrained output voltage ripple and the flatter inductor current (IL) slope seriously result in worse transient response and severe cross-regulation (CR) problems, respectively. Results show that the three-level SITO converter achieves a smaller output voltage ripple in steady state, but it causes the problems of slower transient response time, longer recovery time, larger overshoot/undershoot, and severe CR. Thus, it is desired to develop a technique that can adjust the cross voltage of CFLY such that the three-level topology achieves higher efficiency, lower output voltage ripple, and fast transient response simultaneously. To resolve the aforementioned problems, this paper presents a three-level SITO converter, with the adjustable flying capacitor (AFC) technique, controlled by the superposition ramp control (SRC). The SRC controls on/off time of the power MOSFETs M1-M4 and the output switches SO1-- O3 synchronously where the cross voltage of CFLY is adjusted by the AFC in case of any load changes. Based on the output voltage variation, the CFLY controller of the AFC regulates the load-dependent cross voltage across the CFLY which increases the inductor current slope for fast transient response with a controllable closed loop. On the other hand, for the steady state, the CFLY controller adjusts the cross voltage to 1/2 Vin to minimize the output voltage ripple and achieve high efficiency. Thus, the three-level topology reduces the output voltage ripple, the AFC technique not only speeds up the transient response but also reduces the CR. Measurement results show that the proposed converter achieves a peak efficiency of 89.6 % with output ripples within 3.5mV, and CR and load regulation are 0.028 (mV/mA) and 0.06 (mV/mA), respectively, with only 2.2\u03bcH inductor and 2\u03bcF output capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Fast load-transient responses are crucial for DC-DC converters to cope with the demands of modern highly integrated system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Various techniques have been proposed to improve transient responses by enhancing the speed of the controller, and/or by increasing the slew rate of the inductor current (SRL), as shown in Fig. 10.6.1. To enhance the speed of the controller, a capacitor-current-sensor (CCS) calibration technique with load-transient optimization (LTO) is proposed for current-mode control in [1], and zero-delay synchronized (ZDS) and quasi-current-mode hysteretic control are proposed in [2] and [3], respectively. Although these converters may achieve near-optimal transient responses (only limited by SRL), the circuit complexity is greatly increased. To increase SRL, multiphase topologies have been widely used [1], [2,4]. For an N-phase converter, SRL can be effectively increased by N times, at the expense of using N bulky inductors that increase both volume and cost. Hybrid schemes that comprise the parallel operation of the DC-DC converter and a linear regulator can improve the responses by injecting additional charging current (Ich) without adding extra inductors. In [5], activating and deactivating the hybrid scheme is accomplished by monitoring the output voltage Vo within the steady-state window [Vo-\u0394Vo, Vo]. However, a large \u0394Vo is needed for good noise immunity, and the slow SRL also requires a high Ich that increases loss during the transients.",

        "abstract": "Switching power converters with fast load transients are crucial for application processors (APs) to facilitate system-level power adaptability with high current slew rate. While current-mode hysteretic control has been popularly employed in switching converters for simple structure, robust operation and fast transient response [1], it still does not suffice for the unprecedented 1A/ns current slew rate required by modern APs [2]. Meanwhile, current slew rate can be improved by extending single-phase to multiphase operation. However, when a converter powers light load, power loss caused by added phases adversely affects the efficiency. Active phase count (APC) was thus proposed to manage the number of active phases judiciously to load by sensing average inductor current [3,4]. However, the inherent sensing delay drastically slows down the phase adding/dropping actions and degrades load transient response. On the other hand, phase current imbalance among phase sub-converters could cause hot spots, jeopardizing system reliability. Upgrading from conventional current-mode hysteretic control, we propose a simple synchronized adaptive window (SAW) hysteretic control which automatically adjusts the hysteretic window to speed up the transient response. Inherent clock synchronization makes it a natural fit to multiphase operation, where APC can be accomplished within one switching cycle through an internal current sensing mechanism in the control.",

        "abstract": "High floating-gate (FG) to FG coupling and lithography limitations have been preventing 2D-NAND flash from further reduction in die size, (e.g., there is no ISSCC paper discussing a 3b/cell 2D-NAND after 2013). Alternatively, since high-density multi-stacked 3D-flash was first introduced as BiCS flash, recent dramatic innovations in 3D-flash technologies are rapidly boosting bit density by increasing the number of stacked layers. The first 3b/cell 3D-flash used 32 layers in 2015, and reached 48 layers in 2016. Also, density as high as 2.62 and 4.29Gb/mm2 were achieved, as shown in Fig. 11.1.7. This rapid scaling of 3D-flash technologies is possible since it is free from the lithography limitation mentioned above. This paper describes a 512Gbit 3b/cell flash fabricated with a 64-word-line-layer BiCS technology. In this work, we implemented three technologies: four-block even-odd-combined row decoding to effectively address the increase of stacked layers; unselected string pre-charge operation to improve endurance and reliability, and; shielded BL current sensing to enhance read throughput. Figure 11.1.1 shows the die photo and the summary of key features.",

        "abstract": "Miniature sensor nodes are ideal for monitoring environmental conditions in emerging applications such as oil exploration. One key requirement for sensor nodes is embedded non-volatile memory for compact and retentive data storage in the event that the sensor power source is exhausted. Non-volatile memory also allows for near-zero standby power modes, which are particularly challenging to achieve at high temperatures when using SRAM in standby due to the exponential rise in leakage with temperature, which rapidly degrades battery life (Fig. 11.2.1). However, traditional NOR flash requires mW-level program and erase power, which cannot be sustained by mm-scale batteries with internal resistances >10k\u03a9 To address this issue, we propose an ultra-low power NOR flash design and demonstrate its integration into a complete sensor system that is specifically designed for environmental monitoring under high temperature conditions: such as when injected into geothermal or oil wells.",

In the era of big data, storage devices with versatile characteristics are required for ultra-fast processing, higher capacity storage, lower cost, and lower power operation. SSDs employing 3D NAND are a promising to meet these requirements. Since the introduction of 3D NAND technology to marketplace in 2014, the memory array size has nearly doubled every year. To continue scaling 3D NAND array density, it is essential to scale down vertically to minimize total mold height. However, vertical scaling results in critical problems such as increasing WL capacitance and non-uniformity of stacked WLs due to variation in the channel hole diameter. To tackle these issues, this work proposes schemes for programming speed improvement and power reduction, and on-chip processing algorithms for error correction.",

        "abstract": "The growing demand for battery powered mobile devices is a major driver for reducing power and continued area scaling in SOC chips. Continued scaling of the transistor and metal interconnection geometry is accompanied by increasing random Vt variation and increased wire routing resistance and capacitance variation in advanced technologies. Such variation degrades SRAM performance and its minimum operating voltage, which then seriously impact the battery life of mobile devices. FinFET technology provides a superior short-channel effect and less random dopant fluctuation. However, the quantized channel width and length force constrains on transistor sizing of high density SRAM bitcells. Figure 12.1.1(a) shows the layout of a high density 6T SRAM bit cell with a 0.027\u03bcm2 area in a leading edge 7nm FinFET technology. In order to achieve minimum area, all transistors (PU, PG, PD) in this bitcell have to be sized as single fin. Figure 12.1.1(b) shows a contention between the pull-up (PU) and the pass-gate (PG) transistors during a write operation. A stronger PU transistor results in better read stability, but the write margin is significantly degraded and results in elevation of minimum operation voltage for write operation. The negative bit-line (NBL) technique was proposed to improve write VMIN in previous work [1-6]. In addition to transistor scaling, the geometric scaling of metal and via routing increases the back-end wire RC load, which also significantly degrades SRAM operation speed. In this work, we use a flying BL (FBL) and double WL (DWL) design to mitigate the RC wire load impact in order to improve SRAM array access performance.",

        "abstract": "Conventional patterning techniques, such as self-aligned double patterning (SADP) and litho-etch-litho-etch (LELE), have paved the way for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology that aims to reduce the photomask steps [1,2]. EUV adds the extreme scaling to the high-performance of FinFET technology, thus opening up new opportunities for system-on-chip designers: delivering power, performance, and area (PPA) competitiveness. In terms of area, peripheral logic has scaled down aggressively in comparison to the bitcell given the intense design-rule shrinkage. Figure 12.2.1 shows the bitcell scaling trend and the peripheral logic unit area across different process nodes. Compared to the 10nm process node, the peripheral logic unit area is closer to the bitcell area in a 7nm process node aided by EUV, which allows bi-directional metal lines for scaling. Complex patterns and intensive scaling induce defective elements in the SRAM peripheral logic. Therefore, the probability of yield-loss due to defects is high, which necessitates the need for a repair scheme for the peripheral logic in addition to the SRAM bitcell. Despite the varied literature on bitcell repair, such as the built-in self-repair that analyzes the faulty bitcells to allocate the repair efficiently for a higher repairable rate [3], literature that discusses peripheral logic repair is sparse. Early literature [4] discusses the usage of a sense-amplifier, designed with redundancy, to address the sense-amplifier offset. Nevertheless, it is not related to the peripheral logic repair for yield improvement. This paper exclusively addresses the peripheral logic repair issue to achieve a higher repairable rate. A separate analysis of SRAM macro defect failures, in the bitcell and peripheral logic, provides a deeper understanding so as to increase the maximum repairable rate under random defect conditions.",

        "abstract": "Mobile applications, such as smartphones streaming HD videos or virtual-reality headsets rendering 3D landscapes, need SRAM memories that can be put in a low-power state to extend battery life, but can also offer high performance operation when required [1]. This paper will merge a 10nm technology with a dual-rail SRAM architecture to achieve superior power savings and performance scaling in comparison to the previous 16nm technology node [2]. Due to its simple design and area efficient layout, the 6T SRAM bitcell continues to be the primary memory technology used in almost all SoC and processor designs in high volume manufacturing today. The 10nm technology uses low-leakage, high-performance, second-generation FinFET transistors; it also offers a 6T cell (0.042\u03bcm2), for area and power savings, that does not require read or write assist circuits to achieve low voltage (Vmin) operation. This bitcell uses a fin ratio of 1:2:2 (PU:PG:PD), as illustrated in Fig. 12.3.1.",

The TXM is implemented with three die on a 2-layer laminate LGA module (Figs. 13.1.1 and 13.1.7). Two multimode multiband power amplifier paths (LB/HB) are implemented in a 0.153\u03bcm 1P6M CMOS process, followed by power combiners and harmonic filters in a 0.18\u03bcm 3M2V IPD die and finally an SP10T antenna switch in a 0.18\u03bcm 1P3M SOI process. The Si substrate of good thermal conductivity dissipates the heat generated by PA transistors to the laminated substrate, which solder mask opened and lots of ground vias are deployed underneath the die to effectively conduct the heat out of the package.",

        "abstract": "The evolving trend for increasing data rates in cellular communication systems with limited and fragmented frequency spectrum requires enhanced spectral efficiency of today's and future communication standards. The resulting need for high-order modulation schemes with large peak-to-average power ratio results in stringent requirements on in-channel linearity and SNR. At the same time FDD operation in SAW filter-less designs enforces very demanding limits for out-of-band and spurious emissions. Digital polar TX concepts have demonstrated low power consumption combined with low out-of-band noise in moderate bandwidth applications like WCDMA [1]. However, the implementation of 4G wideband polar systems with 20MHz RF bandwidth and above is very challenging due to the nonlinear conversion from cartesian to polar coordinates extending the effective signal bandwidth even further. A digital quadrature TX concept with up to 80MHz bandwidth, low EVM and moderate power efficiency has been shown in [2]. More than 30% power-added efficiency has been demonstrated in a 20MHz polar TX based on a switched-capacitor digital PA [3]. However, [2,3] suffer from low resolution and limited out-of-band noise performance.",

        "abstract": "Multimode cellular RFICs need high dynamic range in order to simultaneously satisfy the high linearity requirements of LTE and the low-noise performance of 2G. Traditionally, SAW filters are employed to relax the noise-linearity trade-off at the cost of higher BOM. In a highly competitive market, mobile devices need to support >35 LTE bands, a number which is expected to rise further in the future, providing a strong motivation for SAW-less transmitter (TX) design. An LTE TX operating in the single resource-block (RB) mode is susceptible to spurious out-of-band (OOB) emission due to the high power spectral density concentrated in narrow bandwidths at frequency offsets as large as 4.5 MHz (LTE10) or 9 MHz (LTE20) from the carrier. The most challenging condition is for B13 where the 3rd-order counter intermodulation (CIM3) product falls in an adjacent public-safety band. With 23dBm at the antenna, a B13-TX must ensure OOB emission less than -57dBm/6.25kHz in the public safety band.",

        "abstract": "The crowded radio spectrum allocated for 3G/4G mobile communication, together with the growing demand for higher data-rates, has led to the situation where transceivers need to support FDD operation in multiple frequency bands with different TX-RX duplex spacing. In order to reduce costs and enable SAW-less operation, many recent transmitter implementations have thus targeted stringent out-of-band (OOB) emission levels. Analog-intensive TX architectures achieve low OOB noise at the price of large area consumption, as complex reconstruction filters are used to suppress DAC quantization noise and image replicas [1,2]. On the other hand, due to the lack of analog filtering, digital-intensive TX architectures need 12-14b DAC resolution for low OOB noise, which complicates DAC design and typically requires DPD or calibration [3-5]. This work presents an RF transmitter implementing a fully digital solution to the aforementioned challenge. Instead of using bulky analog filtering or high resolution DAC, the disclosed TX employs digital \u0394\u03a3 modulation and mismatch shaping to attenuate the DAC noise at a programmable duplex distance. This solution enables -160dBc/Hz noise in the RX-band, by using only a 10b DAC without DPD, calibration or analog filtering.",

        "abstract": "Advanced wireless radio standards set stringent requirements on the bandwidth, frequency range and reconfigurability of base-station transmitters. Recently, the outphasing concept has shown promise of wide bandwidth while taking advantage of process scaling with extensive exploitation of rail-to-rail signaling. Recent outphasing transmitter designs have often focused on power-amplifier (PA) and power-combiner implementations while omitting the phase modulator [1,2]. Moreover, previously reported transmitters with integrated digital phase modulators have only shown bandwidths up to 40MHz [3,4], although 133MHz has been demonstrated at 10GHz carrier frequency utilizing phase modulators based on conventional IQ-DACs [5]. Thus, digital-intensive outphasing transmitters capable of modulation with hundreds of MHz bandwidth at existing cellular frequency bands have not yet been published. To address the aforementioned challenge, this paper introduces a multilevel outphasing transmitter with four amplitude levels, including the first prototype implementation based on the digital interpolating phase modulator concept [6]. The transmitter is targeted for 5G picocell base stations and has been verified to operate with instantaneous bandwidth up to 400MHz. In addition, the developed phase modulator eliminates the need for complex on-chip frequency synthesizers by introducing digital carrier frequency generation, demonstrated between 0.35 and 2.6GHz, while utilizing a single 1.8GHz reference clock.",

If the transceiver is integrated in a different technology node, multi-chip solutions are required, increasing system cost and form-factor. Traditional radio architectures require extensive use of high-quality passives, which might use large silicon area or not be available due to process limitations. Fast time to market also demands quicker design cycles, where extensive use of standard digital cells and even automated place-and-route tools for layout is preferred [1]. The proposed transmitter leverages a polar architecture with synthesized digital-to-time converter (DTC) wideband phase modulator, an all-digital PLL and a digital PA with matching network implemented on a flip-chip package to enable single-chip integration in 14nm trigate/finFET technology for IoT and wearable SoCs.",

This poses stringent requirements on RF Power Amplifiers (PAs) for their carrier bandwidth, linearity, modulation rate, and efficiency. Several multiband Analog PAs (APAs) and Digital PAs (DPAs) are recently reported. However, multiband APAs often suffer from low power efficiency [1]. Although current-mode DPAs achieve high efficiency, high output power (Pout), and compact designs [2], they typically exhibit excessive AM-PM distortions intrinsically due to the digital power cell operations. Thus, current-mode DPAs often need frequency-dependent AM-PM look-up-tables for pre-distortion and/or real-time phase cancellation, resulting in additional overhead and difficult implementation for high modulation rates [3,4].",

        "abstract": "In today's connected world, smaller and leaner wireless applications emerge, calling for increasingly higher integration and smaller footprint, while ensuring high reliability and operation at limited supply voltages. In this context, the integration of the power amplifier (PA) is a challenge. Wireless transmission requires Watt-level peak power, which is usually achieved by means of a dedicated external PA, although monolithic integration of the PA within the radio transceiver has recently become more and more common [1-6]. In both cases, however, a dedicated PA supply voltage is usually provided, and the PA is typically operated at a higher supply voltage than that of the digital core of the transmitter to achieve the required output power level.",

        "abstract": "Digital power amplifiers and transmitters have drawn significant interest in the recent past due to their reconfigurability, compatibility with CMOS technology scaling and DSP, and potential for automated design synthesis [1-5]. While significant progress has been made in achieving moderate output power levels in CMOS, wideband modulation, and high efficiency under back-off, out-of-band emissions remain an unsolved problem. The elimination of the analog reconstruction filter that follows the DAC in a conventional analog transmitter implies that broadband DAC quantization noise appears at the output of the transmitter unfiltered. Quantization noise can be suppressed by increasing resolution and/or sampling rate, but to meet the challenging -150 to -160dBc/Hz out-of-band (OOB and specifically RX-band) noise requirement of FDD with conventional duplexers, nearly 12b at 0.5GS/s is required. Such a high effective number of bits (ENOB) is extremely challenging in digital PAs given their strong output nonlinearity. Consequently, while low-power modulators are able to approach -150dBc/Hz RX-band noise floor and below [6], state-of-the-art digital transmitters achieve -130 to -135dBc/Hz RX-band noise, nearly 20dB or 100\u00d7 away [2-4]. Embedding mixed-domain FIR filtering into digital transmitters to create notches in the RX band has been proposed [4,7], but, while successful in low-power modulators [7], nonlinearity significantly limits notch depth to <;10dB in digital PAs [4]. Further, notch bandwidth (BW) is far less than 20MHz, the typical LTE BW, in the simple two-tap FIR structures that have been explored [4].",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has become universal in all-around applications. CNNs are used to support vision recognition and processing, and RNNs are able to recognize time varying entities and to support generative models. Also, combining both CNNs and RNNs can recognize time varying visual entities, such as action and gesture, and to support image captioning [1]. However, the computational requirements in CNNs are quite different from those of RNNs. Fig. 14.2.1 shows a computation and weight-size analysis of convolution layers (CLs), fully-connected layers (FCLs) and RNN-LSTM layers (RLs). While CLs require a massive amount of computation with a relatively small number of filter weights, FCLs and RLs require a relatively small amount of computation with a huge number of filter weights. Therefore, when FCLs and RLs are accelerated with SoCs specialized for CLs, they suffer from high memory transaction costs, low PE utilization, and a mismatch of the computational patterns. Conversely, when CLs are accelerated with FCL- and RL-dedicated SoCs, they cannot exploit reusability and achieve required throughput. So far, works have considered acceleration of CLs, such as [2-4], or FCLs and RLs like [5]. However, there has been no work on a combined CNN-RNN processor. In addition, a highly reconfigurable CNN-RNN processor with high energy-efficiency is desirable to support general-purpose deep neural networks (DNNs).",

Today, state-of-the-art mobile GPU's and ConvNet accelerator ASICs [2][3] only demonstrate energy-efficiencies of 10's to several 100's GOPS/W, which is one order of magnitude below requirements for always-on applications.

        "abstract": "Recently, face recognition (FR) based on always-on CIS has been investigated for the next-generation UI/UX of wearable devices. A FR system, shown in Fig. 14.6.1, was developed as a life-cycle analyzer or a personal black box, constantly recording the people we meet, along with time and place information. In addition, FR with always-on capability can be used for user authentication for secure access to his or her smart phone and other personal systems. Since wearable devices have a limited battery capacity for a small form factor, extremely low power consumption is required, while maintaining high recognition accuracy. Previously, a 23mW FR accelerator [1] was proposed, but its accuracy was low due to its hand-crafted feature-based algorithm. Deep learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) is essential to achieve high accuracy and to enhance device intelligence. However, previous CNN processors (CNNP) [2-3] consume too much power, resulting in <;10 hours operation time with a 190mAh coin battery.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition and object detection, among others. Recently there has been increased interest in deep learning for mobile IoT [1] to enable intelligence at the edge and shield the cloud from a deluge of data by only forwarding meaningful events. This hierarchical intelligence thereby enhances radio bandwidth and power efficiency by trading-off computation and communication at edge devices. Since many mobile applications are \u201calways-on\u201d (e.g., voice commands), low power is a critical design constraint. However, prior works have focused on high performance reconfigurable processors [2-3] optimized for large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) that consume >50mW. Off-chip weight storage in DRAM is also common in the prior works [2-3], which implies significant additional power consumption due to intensive off-chip data movement.",

        "abstract": "DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides (A, C, G, T) within a DNA molecule and is now indispensable for genetics and medical research. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), in which short DNA fragments can be sequenced in a massively parallel fashion, enables high-throughput sequencing [1]. However, the succeeding data analysis, also known as DNA mapping, is excessively time consuming. DNA mapping can be partitioned into Suffix Array (SA) Sorting and Backward Searching. Dedicated hardware designs have been proposed to enhance the speed, but only for the less complex Backward Searching [2]. Feasible hardware for the most complicated part, SA sorting, has never been explored. This work presents a fully integrated NGS data processor that realizes both SA sorting and Backward Searching. The distributed sort algorithm is utilized to reduce the sorting complexity. The throughput of SA sorting is maximized through 2,048 insertion-sorting elements. Dedicated overflow and splitter caches are embedded to reduce the computation latency. With the optimized hardware architecture, the NGS processor achieves orders of magnitude improvement in both energy and throughput metrics compared to the high-end generic processors.",

This paper presents a large-area pressure-sensing system that achieves a much greater reduction in the number of interfaces from distributed LAE sensors to CMOS via an array of frequency-hopping, injection-locked, ZnO-TFT digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs).",

The main challenge for flexible metal-oxide RFID tags is to fully comply with the ISO14443-A NFC standard to enable readout by standard NFC reader or handheld devices, due to the limited charge carrier mobility of the semiconductor and multiple sources of parameter variation caused by roughness, temperature and dimensional stability of the foils. Recent work by various groups [1-4] demonstrated only an incremental improvement in data rates from 50b/s to 396.5kb/s to be compatible with ISO14443 (105.9kb/s). In this work, we present a flexible metal-oxide NFC chip that is compliant with ISO14443-A, showcasing advancements on memory size, power consumption and a clock generation circuit.",

These features make a-IGZO TFTs an attractive technology for large-area sensing (e.g. strain, pressure, IR), low-cost RFIDs augmented with sensors and monitoring of biopotentials. In this context, it is crucial to accurately transform analogue sensor signals in a robust representation. The most common choice is a synchronous digital word, but a two-level PWM representation is another interesting possibility. Binary PWM can be transmitted on wire or via RF amplitude modulation with high immunity to noise and interferers.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing holds the promise to achieve unprecedented computation power and to solve problems today intractable. State-of-the-art quantum processors consist of arrays of quantum bits (qubits) operating at a very low base temperature, typically a few tens of mK, as shown in Fig. 15.5.1 The qubit states degrade naturally after a certain time, upon loss of quantum coherence. For proper operation, an error-correcting loop must be implemented by a classical controller, which, in addition of handling execution of a quantum algorithm, reads the qubit state and performs the required corrections. However, while few qubits (~10) in today's quantum processors can be easily connected to a room-temperature controller, it appears extremely challenging, if not impossible, to manage the thousands of qubits required in practical quantum algorithms [1].",

        "abstract": "The extreme sensitivity of nano electro mechanical system (NEMS) to atomic scale physical variations has led to the breakthrough development of NEMS-based mass spectrometry systems capable of measuring a single molecule [1]. Parallel sensing using thousands of devices will help to circumvent the small effective sensing area while opening new perspectives for applications that require spatial mapping. While the development of NEMS CMOS co-integration technology [2] is of paramount importance to achieve high density sensor arrays (>1000 devices), the readout circuitry capable of tracking NEMS resonator frequency shifts is still the limiting factor for the very large scale integration of individually addressed sensors. Moreover, in order to resolve the mass and position of an adsorbed analyte, single particle mass sensing applications require to track simultaneously and in real time at least two modes of the resonators. This requirement adds complexity to the design of the overall system. To respond to the size, power consumption and resolution constraints linked to NEMS array measurement, we propose a compact heterodyne self-oscillator analog front-end IC which performs 1ms simultaneous dual-mode frequency tracking compatible with a \u201cpixel-based\u201d readout scheme. We report less than 1mA power consumption with a 300zg mass resolution for 26000\u03bcm2 size.",

        "abstract": "Understanding dopamine (DA) signaling in the brain is essential for advancing our knowledge of pathological disorders such as drug addiction, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Currently, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with carbon microfiber (CMF) electrodes is the method of choice in neuroscience labs for monitoring the concentration of phasic (transient) DA release. This method offers sub-second temporal resolution and high specificity because the signal of interest occurs at a known potential. However, existing CMF electrodes are bulky, limiting the spatial resolution to single-site measurements. Further, they are produced through manual processes (e.g. cutting CMFs under optical microscope), thus introducing significant device variability [1]. Lastly, when long probes (3-to-5cm) are used to monitor DA release in deep brain structures of large animals, environmental noise severely diminishes the detection limit [1]. To address these problems, we combine advances in nanofabrication with silicon chip manufacturing to create a heterogeneous integrated CMOS-graphene sensor for accurate measurement of DA with high spatiotemporal resolution (Fig. 15.7.1).",

        "abstract": "Physical unclonable function (PUF) is regarded as an emerging solution for reliable cryptography. Rather than storing secret keys in memories, the information of a PUF is extracted through amplification of the physically uncontrollable process variations and therefore, can uniquely authenticate each die to counteract counterfeit, piracy or sabotage. Classically, PUF architectures have exploited process variations affecting transistor-level active device performances such as process-dependent gate delays and interconnect delays, SRAM and inverter maximum gain points, and ring oscillator frequencies [1]-[6]. While active device variations have been exploited to generate PUF signatures, they are susceptible to noise, external perturbations and aging. Since the resultant process variant responses are typically normally distributed, to spread the variance of the distribution and decrease the number of challenges near the unstable decision region, we propose a method to exploit passive variations within the chip in addition to active device variations. While lithographic variations in the smallest metal features may not influence the electrical performance drastically, their effects can be amplified at optical frequencies with wavelengths comparable to the minimal feature size. In fact, before the concept of electronic PUFs were demonstrated in silicon, one of the first implementations of strong PUFs was demonstrated in the optical domain, which exploited speckle-patterns of a random scattering medium in the presence of a laser light. In this work, we present the first CMOS-based opto-active PUF, which not only utilizes the active variations, but also amplifies the lithographic variation of passive metal structures through process-sensitive copper-based CMOS integrated photonic crystals. The measured CMOS chip achieves a native Inter-PUF/Intra-PUF Hamming Distance (HD) ratio of 198X without any post-operation.",

In this work, a three-stage asynchronous pipelined-SAR with open-loop integrator-based amplifiers is used to maximize the sampling frequency, resolution and linearity.

        "abstract": "In traditional ADCs the input signal is sampled at the front-end by a switched-capacitor circuit and all internal signals are processed in discrete-time (DT) even though the front-end sampler introduces artifacts such as aliasing, noise folding, and high-peak ADC driving current to charge the input sampling capacitor. In \u0394\u03a3 ADCs, those issues are resolved by replacing the DT loop filter with a continuous-time (CT) implementation which relaxes the pre-filter and driver requirements in the signal chain thus reducing the overall signal chain power consumption. CT\u0394\u03a3s also introduce additional benefits such as 2-3\u00d7 higher clocking capability in the same process node and low-power internal opamps due to relaxed noise, loading, and gain bandwidth requirements. Since these CT benefits are not exclusive to the \u0394\u03a3 architecture, other ADC architectures could similarly benefit by replacing DT blocks with CT ones. This paper presents a CT pipeline ADC, which processes the input and residue signals with CT circuitry throughout all the pipeline stages. The combination of CT signal processing with the pipeline architecture realizes an ADC system inheriting the CT benefits while achieving a digitization bandwidth (BW) more than 2\u00d7 greater than that of CT \u0394\u03a3 ADCs, which is comparable to DT pipeline ADCs in the same process node.",

        "abstract": "Direct-RF synthesis has gained increasing attention in recent years [1] [2] as it simplifies the transmitter system by eliminating the intermediate frequency stage. It also offers the opportunity to address the extensive range of cellular bands with the same architecture and building blocks. Direct synthesis of carriers in the 5 to 6GHz unlicenced bands remains a challenge for RF-DACs operating in the 1st Nyquist band, as sampling rates in excess of 12GS/s are required. A more power efficient way to synthesize directly these frequencies is to use wideband mixing-DACs, which increase the output power in the 2nd and 3rd Nyquist bands [3]. In [3] the mixing is done using the quad-switch configuration, which doubles the number of switches and drivers, directly impacting the overall DAC width. In [4] the mixer is inserted in-line between the current cell switch and the output cascode, which requires additional headroom in the output stage. Both implementations impact the overall performance and power of the DAC even when the mixing operation is not used. This work presents an alternative implementation of the mixing-DAC using the traditional current switching cell. The mixing is realized in the data path, enabling full utilization of the DAC analog bandwidth across 1st, 2nd and 3rd Nyquist zones without compromising performance. This dual-mode RF-DAC is manufactured in a 16nm FinFET process and demonstrates ACPR better than -70dBc in a 20MHz channel centered at 5.2GHz while dissipating a total power of 330mW including shared biasing, clock receiver and clock distribution.",

        "abstract": "Wireless communication systems and Ethernet networks call for moderate-resolution GS/s energy-efficient ADCs. While previous work [1] shows that the multi-bit per cycle SAR ADC can achieve low power due to various hardware reduction techniques, there are still a few limitations that restrain this architecture. First, the pre-charge slows down the logic and the DAC settling, especially during the MSB conversions. Second, unlike the offset among sub-channels of interleaving SAR ADCs, which can be easily calibrated in the background at the ADC backend [2], the offsets of the comparators in multi-bit SAR ADCs lead to a large sub-ranging error. Such offset is often calibrated in the foreground [1][3] but cannot track voltage and temperature (V&T) variations. This paper presents a 1-then-2b/cycle SAR architecture which removes conventional pre-charging and simultaneously minimizes the logic circuitry complexity to that of a 1b/cycle SAR. The comparator offsets are calibrated in the background without any extra phases or input references. With 2\u00d7 time interleaving, the prototype achieves 2.4GS/s using a 0.9V supply in 28nm CMOS, leading to a 25.3fJ/conv-step Walden FoM at Nyquist input.",

The ADC slice schematic is shown in Fig. 16.5.1. The input is sampled using a thick-oxide NFET driven by a 1.9V buffer. After each conversion the hold node is reset differentially using a core NFET driven by a 1.1V buffer. The 10b DAC consists of two identical 5b halves separated by a bridging capacitor, Cbridge. Cbridge is sized to provide approximately 0.8b of redundancy between the MSB and LSB halves, enabling capacitor mismatch in the MSB half to be corrected digitally. The DAC is controlled by decision latches and uses the split-capacitor switching scheme [1] to provide a constant common mode to the comparator during conversion. The DAC comprises approximately 60% of the 250fF/side hold capacitance, resulting in a 1.2Vppd full-scale range when a 1V reference is used.",

        "abstract": "The push towards mm-wave frequencies has increased the demand for UWB DACs with minimal spurious emissions. At mm-wave, intra-DAC dynamic timing and data errors consume a significant portion of the clock period, degrading SFDR. Previously, NRZ and RZ DACs have been reported with output frequencies up to 27GHz [1-4]. However, their outputs are limited to the first two Nyquist zones, requiring high sample rates which exacerbate dynamic errors. Interleaved DACs allow for synthesis above the first Nyquist zone without increasing the sample rate, although inter-DAC amplitude and timing errors introduce additional spurs at the output that can limit SFDR [5,6]. Alternatively, mixing DACs decouple the sample rate and output frequency, however, they do not deglitch the output, limiting SFDR at high frequency [7]. The multiple return-to-zero (MRZ) architecture mitigates the effects of dynamic errors in the data path, allowing for synthesis up to 9.45GHz with 42dB SFDR [8]. Moreover, the use of R-2R networks achieves binary scaling with the same unit cell current, alleviating switch timing mismatches. Although these techniques improve the intrinsic SFDR of the DAC cells, mismatches in the frequency response of routing interconnects dominate the performance at mm-wave. This is especially critical for the output summing node, which requires an identical amplitude and phase response from each cell to the output. Previously reported DACs used simple structures to combine currents at the output, resulting in large phase and amplitude mismatches. Furthermore, the mm-wave operation of the RZ clock exacerbates the effect of timing errors due to both interconnect and transistor mismatches in the RZ path.",

        "abstract": "Front-end modules (FEM) typically employ expensive III-V or SiGe technologies to provide relatively higher PA output power and lower LNA noise figure (NF) for larger distance coverage compared to what can be achieved in a CMOS transceiver SoC [1]. The WiFi FEM is typically designed as a standalone entity using linear and inefficient PA topologies, such as Class-A/AB, resulting in an FEM not taking advantage of the full capability of the transceiver SoC. Furthermore, due to the stringent EVM requirement, almost 10dB back-off from Psat is required, resulting in a poor PAE of <;7% at +20dBm Pout for the conventional Class-A/AB topologies regardless of device technology [1-3]. The CMOS FEM in Fig. 17.1.1 addresses the above issues and achieves performance comparable to that of GaAs/SiGe FEM but offers higher efficiency while using the full capability of the transceiver to enhance its performance. The proposed FEM integrates a PA, an LNA, a T/R switch, a transmit signal-strength indicator (TSSI) and an RF digital pre-distortion (DPD) calibration loopback path. It has two ICs integrated inside the same package. The PA, the LNA, and the DPD-loopback path are implemented on a 55nm bulk CMOS IC, while the T/R switch, PA output balun, and TSSI are integrated on a 0.18\u03bcm CMOS SOI IC.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge for low-cost silicon-based mm-wave wireless links, e.g., for the 5G communication, is to provide large transmitter (Tx) output power (Pout) with high energy efficiency and linearity from a limited supply voltage, so that the high path loss and limited link budget at mm-wave can be compensated. Power combining is often required for high-power mm-wave Tx. The existing power-combining techniques are mainly in two categories. Passive on-chip/on-package networks can combine Pout from multiple power amplifiers (PAs) and feed a single antenna port [1-4]. However, lossy power combiners and large impedance transformation ratios degrade the total Pout delivered to the antenna and lower the Tx efficiency. Alternatively, spatial power combining using antenna array increases the total EIRP but at the expense of a large array-panel size. Moreover, a large antenna array often presents an exceedingly narrow (or even pencil-sharp) beamwidth; this complicates the Tx/Rx alignment and is challenging for dynamic and mobile mm-wave applications, such as 5G links. In addition, adding silicon lens enhances EIRP but increases cost and packaging complexity.",

        "abstract": "To fully benefit from the progress of CMOS technologies, it is desirable to completely digitize the TX, replacing its final stage with a digitally controlled PA (DPA). The DPA consists of arrays of small sub-PAs that are digitally controlled to modulate the output amplitude, thus operating as an RF-DAC [1-6]. DPAs are normally designed in a switched mode (Classes E/D/D-1, etc.) to achieve high efficiency while using high sampling rate to attenuate and push the spectral images to higher frequencies. However, they suffer from high nonlinearity in their AM-code-word (ACW) to AM and ACW-to-PM conversion. To correct for such nonlinearities, digital pre-distortion (DPD) of the input signal is often used [1-3], typically implemented by look-up tables (LUT). Unfortunately, DPD approaches suffer from large signal-BW expansion due to their inherently nonlinear characteristics. This, combined with the already present BW regrowth in a polar TX in the AM and PM paths, yields significant hardware-speed/power constraints when the signal BW becomes large. For a Cartesian TX, the use of LUT-DPD is even more complicated since a full 2D LUT is typically required [2]. To relax the overall system complexity, it is highly desirable to have a PA with a maximum inherent linearity without compromising its power or efficiency. In this work, an ACW-AM correction based on nonlinear sizing along with controlling the peak voltage of RF clocks (overdrive voltage tuning) and a ACW-PM correction based on multiphase RF clocking are introduced to linearize the characteristic curves of a Class-E polar DPA with intent to avoid any kind of pre-distortion.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave/terahertz rotational spectroscopy offers ultra-wide-detection range of gas molecules for chemical and biomedical sensing. Therefore, wideband, energy-efficient, and fast-scanning CMOS spectrometers are in demand. Spectrometers using narrow-pulse sources and electromagnetic scattering [1] are broadband, but their resolutions do not meet the requirement (<;10kHz) of the absolute specificity. Alternatively, a scheme using a single tunable tone exhibits significant trade-off between bandwidth and performance. The 245GHz spectrometer in [2] presents 4mW radiated power, but only has a 14GHz bandwidth. In [3] and [4], broader bandwidths are achieved at the expense of degraded radiated power (0.1mW) and noise figure (NF=18.4 to ~23.5dB). In addition, given a typical 10kHz resolution and 1ms integration time, scanning a 100GHz bandwidth with a single tone takes as long as 3 hours. This paper reports a rapid, energy-efficient spectrometer architecture based on dual-frequency-comb scanning. A 220-to-320GHz CMOS spectrometer prototype based on this architecture is demonstrated with a total radiated power of 5.2mW and a NF of 14.6 to ~19.5dB.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-wave/THz hyperspectral imaging has numerous applications in security, non-destructive evaluation, material characterization, and medical diagnostics [1]. Unlike single-frequency imaging, hyperspectral imaging operates over a wide frequency range and offers spectroscopic information on each imaging pixel. This combines mm-wave/THz high-resolution imaging with spectroscopy and improves detection sensitivity and specificity. In practice, pulse-based imaging supports fast data acquisition, but requires receiver (RX) with real-time wideband sampling (>50GHz). Such instantaneous broadband imaging modality inevitably exhibits severely degraded sensitivity (due to integrated noise) and requires high-end signal sampling, both of which make it very challenging to achieve a low-cost SoC solution. On the other hand, continuous-wave (CW) imaging supports better sensitivity, especially using coherent detection method with a low IF bandwidth [2-5]. Its operation allows for the use of a simplified heterodyne receiver, enabling silicon-based implementations of the entire imaging system. However, there are limited mm-wave/THz integrated electronic systems available that support CW hyperspectral imaging with a large bandwidth (BW), sufficient output power (Pout), and high sensitivity. Some existing CW transmitters (TX) use the harmonics for wideband coverage, which cannot support full-band scanning at any frequency in the band [2]. In this paper, a full-band CW TX/RX chipset is proposed to realize a generic hyperspectral imaging system without knowing the particular band of interest. We therefore optimize its performance to achieve flat TX Pout and RX conversion gain (CG) over a broad BW. Our mm-wave/THz hyperspectral imaging system comprises a 90-to-300GHz TX with a \u00b12dB Pout variation using a distributed quadrupler architecture and a 115-to-325GHz 4th-subharmonic coherent RX with -115dBm sensit- vity (1kHz RBW) using high-order filter-based matching networks (MNs). The TX and RX chips are flip-chip integrated with wideband vivaldi antennas on low-cost organic LCP (liquid crystal polymer) substrates. This packaged wideband system offers a promising solution for low-cost field-deployable hyperspectral imaging.",

However, an often overlooked definite advantage of wireless links over fiber-optic links is that waves travel at the speed of light c, which is about 50% faster than in optical fibers as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top left). This \u201cminimum latency\u201d is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses over a long distance, including high-frequency trading [1]. Further opportunities and new applications might be created if the absolute minimum latency and fiber-optic data-rates are put together. (Sub-)THz frequencies have an extremely broad atmospheric transmission window with manageable losses as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top right) and will be ideal for building light-speed links supporting fiber-optic data-rates.

These applications demand sufficient radiated power, wide frequency range, and variable phase shifting between sources to perform beam steering. Limited power generation capability of transistors close to the maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) of available silicon processes in addition to the poor quality factor of varactors makes realizing these requirements particularly challenging. Harmonic oscillators are often coupled together in arrays to boost the output power and steer the radiation beam [1-6]. The coupling elements along with varactors used for frequency tuning add loss and parasitics to the circuit and significantly reduce the output power, operation frequency, and tuning range at mm-wave/THz frequencies. In this work, we implemented a standing-wave (SW) structure that overcomes these challenges to achieve broadband frequency tuning, wide beam steering and high power radiation at the same time.",

However, significant challenges remain, particularly the presence of a strong transmitter (TX) self-interference (SI) coupling to the receiver (RX). Numerous recent efforts on mitigating SI have focused on using active cancellation techniques [1-5]. However, these methods are challenged by either a degradation in noise performance [2], high power consumption [1,4], large silicon area [5], the inability to adequately cancel a high-output-power TX signal [3-4], or achieve a relatively narrow cancellation bandwidth [3,5]. Moreover, other sources of SI are presented to the RX, including the effects of (1) in-band TX thermal noise, which can exceed the RX noise floor, (2) the RX LO phase noise (PN), which reciprocally mixes with SI, further degrading the C/I ratio. This paper presents several circuit-level techniques, which contribute toward reducing the interaction between the TX and RX in FD radios.",

Providing more TX-RX isolation in the ANT interface that is robust to environmental variations lowers the self-interference cancellation (SIC) and dynamic range required in the RF, analog baseband (BB), and digital domains. Reciprocal shared-ANT interfaces, such as electrical-balance duplexers [2], fundamentally feature at least 3dB loss (practically >4dB). A non-reciprocal active shared-ANT duplexing scheme was demonstrated in [3], but such active approaches are limited in their maximum supported TX power (-17.3dBm in [3] limited by RX compression) and noise performance. An integrated FD RX with a magnetic-free non-reciprocal passive circulator was demonstrated in [4]. Despite the circulator's low loss and relatively high linearity, the RX could only handle up to -7dBm TX power due to limited circulator isolation and RX LNA linearity. NF under cancellation was also as high as 10.9dB.",

        "abstract": "Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars can provide high resolution and superior sensitivity for wireless sensing [1-3]. Radar signals, whose frequency increases or decreases linearly with time, are transmitted via an antenna, reflected from an object, and then received through an antenna after a time delay. Therefore, the frequency difference between the transmitted and received signals can define the distance and speed of objects. There are two approaches of interfacing antenna for a FMCW radar, namely two-antenna (i.e. separated-antenna) and single-antenna (i.e. shared-antenna) methods. A single-antenna FMCW radar is more compact, but more difficult to implement than a two-antenna one. On-chip in-band full duplexers (IBFDs) with a self-interference cancellation mechanism can support general integrated single-antenna wireless systems [4-6]. For the specific application of a FMCW radar, a duplex RF front-end without the complexity of on-chip IBFDs has been proposed. With it, an integrated FMCW radar is allowed to transmit and receive simultaneously via a single antenna. In this work, an integrated X-band FMCW radar chip is implemented in 65nm CMOS and a wireless demonstration of the radar chip is presented.",

The next three presentations discuss frequency synthesizers. The first is a digital 50-to-66GHz PLL featuring low noise and low spur levels by leveraging a high-speed TDC and intensive calibrations. The second and third PLLs are based on ring-oscillators and leverage subsampling phase detection and FIR filtering, respectively, to achieve simultaneously low noise and compact area. The session is concluded with an ultra-low-voltage DCO in a 16nm FinFET technology.",

        "abstract": "Circular-polarized (CP) radiation is found to be a viable choice for imaging/sensing applications by offering faster scan time and robust source-detector alignment compared to linear radiation [1]. Power-efficient generation of a low-noise, high-power mm-wave/THz circular-polarized signal in silicon continues to be a challenging task. Due to limited output power of transistors at mm-wave, power combining methods (e.g., on-chip or spatial power combining) are employed to achieve high radiated power from multiple oscillator elements [1-5]. These methods, however, require lossy passive or power-hungry active coupling networks to lock the oscillators together, thereby degrading DC-to-RF efficiency [2]. This work introduces a high-efficiency and high-power multiport element, which can concurrently perform as a resonator, a power combiner, and a radiator, thereby avoiding the coupling networks and antenna buffers (Fig. 19.1.1). This structure enables CP radiation by exciting a radially symmetric radiator with evenly spaced phases of an RF signal [3]. These elements can be employed in an array configuration to obtain higher directivity (Fig. 19.1.1).",

        "abstract": "To meet requirements of high data-rates, RF transceivers for a 5G standard must have an ultra-wide bandwidth in a mm-wave band. A big challenge of a 5G transceiver is to generate ultra-low-PN (phase noise) local-oscillator (LO) signals to suppress integrated PN (IPN) over such an extremely wide bandwidth. A PLL that directly generates mm-band LO signals is not a good choice due to power-hungry frequency dividers and relatively poor PN. An mm-band LO generator, cascading a GHz-range PLL and a frequency multiplier as shown in Fig. 19.2.1, is an attractive solution. First, a GHz-range PLL can have a higher FOM than a mm-band PLL [1]. Second, the cascaded architecture is naturally able to support the bands for 2G to 4G standards. An injection-locked frequency multiplier (ILFM) is popular in a mm-band, achieving ultra-low PN even in a tight power budget. However, the vulnerability of PN to PVT variations is a critical problem. For an ILFM, the PN performance can be improved only when the free-running VCO frequency, fVCO, and the target frequency are sufficiently close within the lock range, fL, which is very narrow, especially, at high frequencies. To calibrate fVCO over PVT, many frequency-tracking loops (FTLs) have used a power-hungry circuit (such as a replica-VCO, a TDC, and a counter) operating at fVCO, but they were not suitable for a mm-band ILFM. The sub-sampling FTL [2] used the voltage levels of the VCO outputs, momentarily sampled by injection pulses. However, for the accurate sampling, the pulse width of the injection pulses must be very narrow, since the sampling occurs at the edges of the pulses. For a mm-band VCO, the pulse width must be less than 10ps, but these narrow pulses limit the injection strength and fL. In the mm-band ILFM of [3], the mixers and dividers consumed a lot of power. An envelope detector was used for another mm-band ILFM to enable the calibration operating at low frequencies [4],- but it cannot detect fVCO after the VCO is injection-locked and prevent PN degradation due to real-time drifts of fVCO.",

However, mm-wave synthesizers still rely on analog PLLs, predominantly of the integer-N type [1]. This is due to limited DCO tuning resolution and challenges in phase digitization including limited resolution, linearity, and input frequency of the TDC. The 60GHz ADPLL in [2] uses a 32\u00d7 CML/injection-locked-frequency-divider chain in the DCO-TDC interface, which results in high power consumption (>0.5 of total power), large area, and high in-band phase noise. This paper presents a 60GHz phase-domain ADPLL with a 16GHz tuning range, digital phase extraction at fDCO/4, and several on-chip calibration techniques that enable low in-band phase noise and spurs.",

        "abstract": "High-performance phase-locked loops (PLLs) and clock multipliers with low jitter/phase noise are essential for numerous applications, such as digital microprocessors and SoCs, wireline/optical links, data converters and wireless radios. Given the increasing cost per unit area of advanced CMOS nodes and the need for a multitude of PLLs in complex digital systems, there is a need to miniaturize the area of PLLs while not sacrificing jitter and phase noise performance. Ring oscillators are extremely compact when compared with their LC counterparts, but exhibit typically 15-to-20dB worse phase noise performance. A conventional analog charge-pump PLL that exploits a passive loop filter can be low-noise but requires a large loop-filter capacitor for frequency compensation, which dominates the area in a ring-oscillator PLL. An analog sub-sampling PLL [1] dramatically lowers in-band phase noise, but requires an even larger loop-filter capacitor to achieve comparable loop dynamics unless pulsing is employed [1,2]. Digital PLLs are extremely compact but are plagued by quantization-noise and deterministic-jitter issues. Active loop filters can substantially lower the area requirements as well, but are associated with severe linearity and (phase) noise penalties, which are further exacerbated as CMOS technology scales. A time-based proportional-integral-controlled (PI-controlled) active loop filter was presented in [3] that uses a current-controlled ring oscillator (CCRO) as an ideal integrator, addressing linearity and DC gain challenges, but the loop filter noise results in a jitter Figure-of-Merit (FOM) that is >10dB inferior to state-of-the-art ring-oscillator PLLs.",

        "abstract": "Multicore processors have been widely used in battery-operated portable systems, desktop, and server applications, where dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) techniques are commonly employed to lower power consumption and improve thermal performance of the cores. High-bandwidth digital low-dropout (DLDO) regulators are used to achieve fast, cost-effective, and energy-efficient functions for on-chip power domains. Nowadays, processor vendors provide software for DVS, allowing the processor to scale the VOUT to the desired operating-performance point (OPP). However, the DLDO produces an undesirable output voltage ripple \u0394VOUT due to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. More specifically, the DLDO has a current quantization error (CQE), which depends on the drive current of the least significant bit (LSB) switch in power MOSFET array. PVT variations produce changes in the CQE resulting in different \u0394VOUT at different OPPs. This paper presents a DLDO regulator with an anti-PVT-variation technique permitting tradeoffs among the output voltage ripple, transient performance and load regulation. Experimental results show that the proposed DLDO regulator achieves less than 3mV output ripple \u0394VOUT, while T ranges from 0-80\u00b0C and VOUT ranges from 0.6-1V in steady state, and the transient response time is 1.3\u03bcs in case of a load step from 1mA to 201mA.",

        "abstract": "Modern subthreshold SoC designs feature multiple power domains to dynamically track the maximum energy-efficiency point (0.32-0.45V [1]) in response to application demands. While analog low-drop-out (LDO) regulators have shown rapid response times (e.g. TR = 0.65ns [2]) and excellent steady-state performance, they fail to operate at the low input voltages, VIN, typically supplied to such SoCs via either a high-efficiency switching DC-DC converter or an external harvesting source (e.g., VIN = 0.5V). On the other hand, digital LDOs (DLDOs) are becoming popular in low-voltage SoC designs where they can operate reliably from supplies down to 0.5V. However, conventional DLDOs respond slowly to large current steps, especially at low voltages (e.g., TR = ~44ns, 57.1ns, and 4\u03bcs at VIN=1V [3-5], and 20\u03bcs at VIN=0.5V [1]). Furthermore, they suffer from limited dynamic range over which the load is regulated and stable (e.g. <; 50\u00d7 [1,4,5]) and occupy a large active area due to barrel-shifter-based control. While slow response can be mitigated with a higher sampling frequency, fs, this comes at increased power consumption and, importantly, reduced loop stability. To address these issues, this paper presents a 0.5V 0.0023mm2 recursive all-digital LDO (RLDO) in 65nm with hybrid PD-SAR and PWM duty control that achieves 15.1ns and 100ns response and settling times, respectively, while maintaining 5.6mV/mA load regulation and loop stability across a 20,000\u00d7 dynamic load range, eclipsing state-of-the-art active area, response time, settling time, and dynamic range metrics across prior-art digital LDOs by over an order of magnitude.",

However, as many SoCs generate a load current (ILOAD) variation at sub-A/ns level, voltage regulators require a large area-consuming output capacitor (COUT) to maintain the output voltage (VOUT) during fast transients. A conventional shift-register (SR)-based DLDO [1] suffers from a power and speed trade-off, thus requires a large COUT. To break the tie and minimize COUT, [2-5] applied coarse-fine tuning and adaptive clocking, but a fast sampling clock is still necessary for instantaneous VOUT sensing. Event-driven control used in [6] reacts fast within one clock cycle, but the ADC (with 7 comparators) and the digital PI controller increase the complexity and power consumption. This work presents an analog-assisted (AA) tri-loop control scheme for transient improvement, low power, and COUT reduction.",

        "abstract": "Multicore application processors in smartphones/watches use power-saving techniques such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to extend battery cycle, and supply cores with different voltages [1]. High-efficiency fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) power converters with no external components are promising candidates [2]. Typically, SC converters with different specifications are independently designed (Fig. 20.5.1), leading to a large area overhead, as each converter has to handle its peak output power. Recently, multi-output SC converters are reported to tackle this issue. In [3], an on-demand strategy is used to control two outputs, each with a different loading range, and the outputs are not interchangeable. In [4], the two output voltages are fixed with voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) of 2\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 only. In [5], the controller is integrated, but the three output voltages are still from three individual SC converters. Without reallocating the capacitors in the power stages, capacitor utilization is low, as margins have to be reserved to cater for each converter's peak output power. This paper presents a fully integrated dual-output SC converter with dynamic power-cell allocation for application processors. The power cells are shared and can be dynamically allocated according to load demands. A dual-path VCO that works independently of power-cell allocation is proposed to realize a fast and stable regulation loop. The converter can deliver a maximum current of 100mA: one output can be adjusted to deliver 100mA, while the other handles a very light load; or both outputs can be adjusted to deliver 50mA each with over 80% efficiency.",

        "abstract": "In today's system-on-chip designs, a low-drop-out voltage regulator (LDO) is one of the most popular choices to create a distinct voltage domain owing to its high power density. Many LDOs, however, need a large output capacitor (COUT) to compensate a fast load current (ILOAD) change, increasing the number of pins and off-chip components. In synchronous digital LDO designs, high frequency can miniaturize COUT, but it inevitably causes power inefficiency [2]. A recent work has instead employed an event-driven (ED) control scheme to alleviate the COUT requirement, demonstrating a 400\u03bcA-class digital LDO with a COUT of 400pF [1]. The ED scheme is promising, but it is still desirable to develop an LDO which can support a larger ILOAD with a smaller COUT. This is indeed a daunting challenge since a substantial reduction in feedback latency (TLAT) is necessary to retain the same level of output voltage change (\u0394VOUT) with a smaller COUT. In this work, to shorten latency, we propose to infuse fine-grained parallelism into ED control systems and develop a fully integrated digital LDO. The prototyped LDO can support 1.44mA ILOAD at 0.5V VIN, 0.45V VSP, and 99.2% peak current efficiency. The LDO shows less than 34mV (7.6%) \u0394VOUT with a 0.1nF COUT when \u0394ILOAD is \u00b11.44mA.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an ANSI S1.11 1/3-octave filter-bank chip for binaural hearing aids with two microphones per ear. Binaural multimicrophone systems significantly suppress noise interference and preserve interaural time cues at the cost of significantly higher computational and power requirements than monophonic single-microphone systems. With clock rates around the 1MHz mark, these systems are ideal candidates for low-power implementation through charge-recovery design. At such low clock frequencies, however, charge-recovery logic suffers from short-circuit currents that limit its theoretical energy efficiency [1]. The chip described in this paper is designed in 65nm CMOS using a new charge-recovery logic, called zero-short-circuit-current (ZSCC) logic, that drastically reduces short-circuit current. It processes 4 input streams at 1.75MHz with a charge recovery rate of 92%, achieving 9.7\u00d7 lower power per input compared with the 40nm monophonic single-input chip that represents the published state of the art [2].",

A key barrier to widespread deployment of autonomous bacterial sensors is the detection of low-level bioluminescence, which is typically quantified with power-hungry (watt-level) detection hardware such as Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMT). Prior work has reported successful integrated mW-level detection of bioluminescence by using PN / PIN photodiodes with OTA-based [2] and active-pixel-sensor circuits [3,4].

        "abstract": "Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been studied to monitor lung ventilation because it is the only real-time lung imaging method without large equipment [1-2]. However, previous EIT systems just provided 2D cross-sectional image with limited spatial information of the lung and unneglectable volume detection error depending on the location of 2D EIT belt relative to the patient's lung. In spite of its importance, the 3D-EIT has not been realized in lung monitoring because it has many design challenges such as noises incurred by complicated wiring, long cable length, wide variation in electrode contact and signal, and large personal-to-person impedance variation. In this paper, we present a portable 3D-EIT SoC for real-time lung ventilation monitoring with following 5 features: 1) The active electrodes (AEs) system to reduce coupling noise, 2) High output impedance current stimulator to inject stable current, 3) Impedance spectroscopy to enable both time-difference (TD) EIT and frequency-difference (FD) EIT, and to select an optimal frequency for TD-EIT, 4) Wide-dynamic range front-end circuit to detect variable ranges of signal with high-input impedance and CMRR, 5) Calibration to reduce the electrical characteristics variations of AEs.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric transducer (PT) is an emerging energy-based technology for electrosurgery. With proper driving signals, the PT is utilized as an electric scalpel. It converts an electric signal into physical displacements for various electro-surgical functions, such as ultrasonic vessel sealing and dissecting. The major challenge is to precisely regulate and quickly build a mechanical power up when changing between various surgical functions. The pulse width modulation (PWM) mainly bases its design on a small signal model, thus, does not often fit for the large signal transient satisfactorily. This problem becomes even worse when changing load impedance due to the pressure upon the surgical tip. The sliding mode control (SMC) has reliable and fast performance for nonlinear large signal applications. However, the SMC cannot be simply applied since the electric scalpel is significantly different from generic DC-DC converters. In this paper, a SMC controller for an electric scalpel system is designed for the first time, featuring compact size, automatic resonance tracking, and fast response for electrosurgical operation. The architecture of the electric scalpel system has three nested loops: Loop I is a bandpass filter-based oscillator (BPO) for power generation. The conventional close-loop driving solution dynamically senses the PT's impedance, executes the power-factor correction (PFC), and tracks the target resonance . However, the complex sensing causes delay and does not fit for drastic load changing. The BPO method utilizes the PT's intrinsic nature as the bandpass filter, automatically captures the dominant resonance, and features a simpler architecture with less hardware cost. For power regulation, Loop II is a current-fed DC-AC converter with an enhanced SMC that achieves high regulation accuracy for steady-state and fast response for large load transition. Loop III utilizes a phase-locked loop (PLL) to discriminate the non-longitudinal modes in the time-doma- n, and prevents the scalpels from being stuck. This method features higher sensitivity than the conventional filter based approach. Compared with the discrete solutions, the monolithic integration reduces the delay of Loop I and enhances the Q and resonant efficiency. Moreover, the conventional bulky system with discrete mainframe box can be integrated into the scalpel's handler, improving the feasibility for the minimum invasive surgery.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are used in a growing range of applications, e.g., haptic feedback systems, cooling fans, and microrobots. However, to fully realize their potential, these actuators require drivers able to efficiently generate high-voltage (>100Vpp) low frequency (<;300Hz) analog waveforms from a low-voltage source (3-to-5V) with small form factor. Certain applications, such as piezoelectric (PZT) cooling fans, further demand low distortion waveforms (THD+N <; 1%) to minimize sound emission from the actuator. Existing solutions for small PZT drivers typically rely on designs comprising a power converter to step up a low voltage followed by a high-voltage amplifier [1,2,3]. Although envelope tracking can help reduce amplifier power [3], none of these designs can recover the energy stored on the actuator to maximize efficiency. And while a differential bidirectional flyback converter [4] can recover energy, it requires four inductors, thereby incurring large size penalty. This paper introduces a single-inductor, highly integrated, bidirectional, high-voltage actuator driver that achieves 12.6\u00d7 lower power and 2.1\u00d7 lower THD+N at a similar size to the currently available state-of-the art solution [1]. Measured results from an IC prototype demonstrate 200Hz sinusoidal waveforms up to 100Vpp with 0.42% THD+N from a 3.6V source while dissipating 57.7mW to drive a 150nF capacitor. Beyond PZT actuators, the IC can also drive any type of capacitive load, e.g., electrostatic and electroactive polymer actuators.",

        "abstract": "IoT devices are becoming increasingly intelligent and context-aware. Sound is an attractive sensory modality because it is information-rich but not as computationally demanding as alternatives such as vision. New applications of ultra-low power (ULP), `always-on' intelligent acoustic sensing includes agricultural monitoring to detect pests or precipitation, infrastructure health tracking to recognize acoustic symptoms, and security/safety monitoring to identify dangerous conditions. A major impediment for the adoption of always-on, context-aware sensing is power consumption, particularly for ultra-small IoT devices requiring long-term operation without battery replacement. To sustain operation with a 1mm2 solar cell in ambient light (100lux) or achieve a lifetime of 10 years using a button cell battery (2mAh), <;20nW power consumption must be achieved, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than current state-of-the-art acoustic sensing systems [1,2]. More broadly a previous ULP signal acquisition IC [3] consumes just 3nW while 64nW ECG monitoring system [4] includes back-end classification, however there are no sub-20nW complete sensing systems with both analog frontend and digital backend.",

        "abstract": "Advances in machine learning (ML) and the internet-of-things (IoT) have resulted in a renewed interest in analog matrix-vector multiplication (MvM) accelerators [1-3]. Classification based tasks have exploited low-to-medium resolution multiplication and accuracy boosting algorithms in order to compensate for the reduced resolution. Complementing classification, tasks like source separation and localization have diverse applications ranging from signal conditioning in communication [4] and ultrasound to electroencephalography (EEG) [5] source localization and spike sorting, and greatly benefit from similar algorithms. However, due to their lower resolution and limited channel count previously developed systems cannot be directly applied to this task. High-resolution analog multiplication introduces challenges that have limited prior work to less than 6-bit multiplication in the analog domain. Alternative approaches utilizing very high oversampling result in very inefficient solutions. High precision in matrix-multiplication can mitigate the effects of ill-conditioned (almost singular) matrices, as with beamforming separation of near-collinear sources, and other tasks incurring principal component analysis [3] or independent component analysis (ICA) [5]. As seen in Fig. 21.7.1, a large signal dynamic range at the input can results in an untenable dynamic range specification on the downstream data-converters leading to greater than 10\u00d7 increase in power [4]. Thus, we present a multichannel multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) mixed-signal linear transform system, with analog signal path and digital coefficient control, composed of an array of 14-bit Nested Thermometer Multiplying DACs (NTMDACs) implementing analog multiplication, and variable gain amplifier (VGA) implementing accumulation. We demonstrate state-of-the art performance on two tasks, spectrally oblivious interference suppression in communication signals and EEG signal separation.",

        "abstract": "Inductive coupling for power transfer is increasingly popular in many applications such as RFID and wireless charging. While much recent work has focussed on receivers, less consideration has been given to the transmit function. High-Q antenna circuits are beneficial for several reasons. Activation of a link at a distance requires a large magnetic field from the transmitter, so for a given antenna current, lower driver voltages may be used, simplifying the driver and its power supplies, and improving overall efficiency. Further, the inherent filtering allows a high-efficiency switching driver to be used while reducing harmonics in the current. However, the consequent narrow bandwidth requires precise tuning to resonance. The excitation frequency may be varied in some applications, but this transfers the tuning problem to the receiver. Any transmit tuning circuitry must be linear with large voltages (from a few V to kV) and currents (mA to many A). A conventional technique is to use multiple external capacitors selected by large switches or even relays. The number of selectable elements needed depends on the Q factor, component tolerances, and environmental effects, with a typical system requiring 5 or more extra capacitors and associated HV switches (Fig. 22.1.1), plus extra IC pins, adding to system cost and volume.",

While RF wireless power transfer suffers from substantial tissue attenuation, a wireless piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) is more attractive for deep-tissue implant applications . Typical PEH interfaces with a full-bridge rectifier for AC-DC conversion with limited extractable electrical power due to the PEH inherent capacitance (Cp). The parallel-synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (P-SSHI) technique can increase the output energy by flipping the PEH voltage using resonance, whereas other techniques focus on boosting the PEH voltage swing to increase the extracted power. Yet, all of them require a bulky external high-Q inductor to ensure a high power-extraction enhancement. This work reports an inductorless fully integrated PEH interface, achieving a high voltage flipping efficiency (\u03b7F) of 0.85 and a maximum output-power increasing rate (MOPIR) of 4.83\u00d7 when compared with a full-bridge rectifier interface.",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transmission (WPT) via inductive coupling is used in many applications such as biomedical implants, sensors, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). Range extension, robustness against load (RL) variations and coil misalignments and rotations, and miniaturization of inductive links are key in such applications, demanding new architectures for the integrated power management (IPM) [1-6]. Conventional IPMs in the form of rectifiers or doublers operate in voltage mode (VM) using active synchronous switches to achieve high AC-DC power-conversion efficiency (PCE) in [1-3]. However, they suffer from limited voltage-conversion efficiency (VCE), requiring large AC carriers across the receiver (RX) LC-tank. In [4], the RX LC-tank has been shorted twice in every power carrier cycle for RL modulation. Although this approach increases PTE for small RL, it is not suitable for large RL and VCE is still less than 1. A resonant current-mode (CM) IPM has recently been presented in [5], primarily used for recharging battery-powered implants with sub-volt AC carriers. However, it requires a battery for startup and is not suitable for direct WPT. For applications that involve large coupling distance (d) and RL variations, neither VM- nor CM-only IPMs achieve highest power transmission efficiency (PTE), because VM and CM are suitable for small and large d or RL, respectively [6].",

To enable the mobile devices charging others without additional hardware, we propose a reconfigurable bidirectional 6.78MHz WPT transceiver (TRX) that reuses the LC resonant tank and 4 area-consuming power transistors for the differential Class-D power amplifier (PA) and the full-wave rectifier.

        "abstract": "With more and more functions in modern battery-powered mobile devices, enabling light-harvesting in the power management system can extend battery usage time [1]. For both indoor and outdoor operations of mobile devices, the output power range of the solar panel with the size of a touchscreen can vary from 100s of \u03bcW to a Watt due to the irradiance-level variation. An energy harvester is thus essential to achieve high maximum power-point tracking efficiency (\u03b7T) over this wide power range. However, state-of-the-art energy harvesters only use one maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) method under different irradiance levels as shown in Fig. 22.5.1 [2-5]. Those energy harvesters with power-computation-based MPPT schemes for portable [2,3] and standalone [4] systems suffer from low \u03b7T under low input power due to the limited input dynamic range of the MPPT circuitry. Other low-power energy harvesters with the fractional open-cell voltage (FOCV) MPPT scheme are confined by the fractional-constant accuracy to only offer high \u03b7T across a narrow power range [5]. Additionally, the conventional FOCV MPPT scheme requires long transient time of 250ms to identify MPP [5], thereby significantly reducing energy capture from the solar panel. To address the above issues, this paper presents an energy harvester with an irradiance-aware hybrid algorithm (IAHA) to automatically switch between an auto-zeroed pulse-integration based MPPT (AZ PI-MPPT) and a slew-rate-enhanced FOCV (SRE-FOCV) MPPT scheme for maximizing \u03b7T under different irradiance levels. The SRE-FOCV MPPT scheme also enables the energy harvester to shorten the MPPT transient time to 2.9ms in low irradiance levels.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in circuits have enabled significant reduction in the size of wireless systems such as implantable biomedical devices. As a consequence, the battery integrated in these systems has also shrunk, resulting in high internal resistances (~10k\u03a9). However, the peak-current requirement of power-hungry components such as radios remains in the mW range, and hence cannot be directly supplied from the battery. Therefore, duty-cycled architectures such as pulsed-based radios have been proposed that transmit a short burst (~1\u03bcs) of high power (~10mW) supplied by an internal energy storage capacitor [1-3]. The capacitor is then recharged using a current limiter to protect the battery from excessive droop. This paradigm raises two challenges: 1) to supply sufficient energy, very large capacitance (>50nF) is often needed (200mV droop, for 10mW and 5\u03bcs), leading to large die area or bulky off-chip discrete components; 2) only a small fraction (~5%) of energy stored in the capacitor is actually delivered to the high power components since the capacitor can only be discharged by a few 100s of mV while maintaining proper circuit operation (Fig. 22.6.1).",

        "abstract": "Biomedical implants are often powered by an external source via an inductively-coupled wireless power link. During actual use the distance between the external and implant coils may change, their axes may misalign, and the load current may change significantly in implants that alternate between monitoring and stimulation. Ideally the wireless power link should deliver a stable voltage to the implant across reasonable ranges of these variations, thereby eliminating a lossy voltage limiter and alignment magnets. We present the analysis and design of a new link architecture to meet all these objectives. It stands apart from similar work in that this link self-regulates against all variations, with no need for a reverse channel.",

        "abstract": "Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are becoming the dominant lighting source over their conventional counterparts. Besides the benefits of high efficiency and long lifetime, LEDs also show great potential for high-speed data transmission because of their wide bandwidth (BW). In addition to offering general lighting, the light output can be modulated with fast-switched LEDs to achieve visible light communication (VLC). Though over 100Mb/s data-rate has been demonstrated with white LEDs in the laboratory, the high-frequency modulation is hardly supported by commonly used dimmable drivers with switching converters to regulate LED current. In these drivers, the changing slope of LED current is limited by both low loop BW and large inductors and capacitors [1]. The linear multiple-string LED drivers [2], free of inductors and big capacitors, theoretically can provide higher turn on/off speed. However, the light output of these drivers usually varies significantly at the double-line-frequency, which not only is considered as a harmful optical flicker, but also greatly affects the effectiveness of data transmission. The linear driver in [3] regulates the product of LED current and LED voltage to mitigate the optical variation, but a multiplier has to be added in the regulation loop, resulting in limited BW.",

However, GDDR5 data rates are saturating due to limitations in the clock frequency and column-access cycle time (tCCD). To reach the data rate of 9Gb/s/pin [1], a GDDR5 DRAM has to be clocked at 2.25GHz and operate at a tCCD of 888ps. This combination makes the design of control logic, data path and memory core difficult in a typical DRAM process. Still, the industry is demanding higher system bandwidth to enable continuous improvements in the visual computing arena. For this purpose, an 8Gb GDDR5X DRAM has been developed reaching a data rate of 12Gb/s/pin, which surpasses the fastest published GDDR5 [1] by 33%. This paper introduces GDDR5X and discusses relevant circuit techniques in clock generation, receiver and transmitter design to enable the higher data rates on a conventional DRAM process.",

        "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) requires that more data are collected and processed by devices with faster response, but lower power consumption. In order to achieve these unprecedented requirements, a high-speed DRAM with low-power dissipation at standby and during low-frequency operation in a small footprint is necessary. In addition, a higher degree of reliability is expected for some applications: such as transportation and healthcare. One promising solution, on-chip error correction coding (ECC), has gained traction among memory companies [1] and is now required by the LPDDR4 standard for the first time [2]. In this paper, a 2Gb LPDDR4 that dissipates 75% less refresh current than a conventional LPDDR4 is presented. The proposed LPDDR4 exploits ECC to reduce refresh current, periodically activated voltage regulators to reduce standby power, and dual CA buffers to save the buffer current during low frequency operation. In addition, circuit designs for cell screen of DRAM with on-chip ECC, and for high-speed wafer test for known good die (KGD) - essential for small form factor devices using system-in-package (SiP) - are presented.",

        "abstract": "With the growth of wearable devices, such as smart watches and smart glasses, there is an increasing demand for lower power dissipation, to achieve longer battery life with limited battery capacity. Nevertheless, memory bandwidth needs to increase to support high-resolution graphic engines. Since most wearable devices are event driven, they consume a bulk of power in standby mode. Therefore, it is crictical to reduce standby-mode power, as well as improve active-mode power efficiency. However, DRAM's periodic self-refresh, critical for data retention, imposes a lower bound on standby-mode power. This paper presents a 2Gb LPDDR4 SDRAM with 0.15mW standby mode power, which is 66% lower than the standby power for a memory of the same density. The proposed memory also achieves a bandwidth of 3.733Gb/s/pin. To extremely reduce standby mode power, an in-DRAM error-correction-code (ECC) engine is used for self-refresh current reduction. Intensive power gating in deep-power-down (DPD) mode, a temperature controlled internal power generator and an aggressively increased gate length is also used to reduce leakage current. In addition, active-mode power efficiency is improved by using a dual-page-size scheme.",

Along with performance improvements in the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and the magnetic tunnel junction's (MTJ) required switching current, there have also been reports on high-capacity (up to tens of Mb) STT-MRAM [1-4]. In [2] a perpendicular-TMR (pMTJ) device is used to reduce the switching current and a high-speed current sense amplifier is proposed. In [3] a 54nm 2T-1MTJ 14F2-cell is proposed that uses a high-density DRAM process: self-aligned contact and plug process. However, the unit cell area of STT-MRAM is still much larger than that of DRAM, making STT-MRAM not cost-competitive to contemporary DRAM.",

        "abstract": "Although the LPDDR4 interface has enabled industry requirements, such as low power consumption and high bandwidth, additional evolution of the current LPDDR4 performance is expected. To respond to the need for more power efficient devices with higher bandwidth, a 2nd generation LPDDR4 (referred to as LPDDR4X), with extreme low power and extended performance, has been developed in this work. In the controller, the output drivers for data signal (DQ) and data strobe signal (DQS) dominate the power consumption. An efficient method to reduce the output driver power is to reduce the supply voltage (VDDQ) [1]. A low voltage-swing terminated logic (LVSTL) [2] can support this solution by changing the operation region of the pull-up NMOS transistor from the saturation region to the triode region. However, another power supply whose minimum value is VTH_NMOS+VDDQ is required for the pull-up NMOS transistor to serve as source-series termination. In this work, P-over-N topology replaces LVSTL and allows for the use of a single VDDQ (0.6V), thus reducing pre-driver power. Another major improvement in the proposed LPDDR4X controller is that it has functions to compensate for the large variation of DQS output transition time from CK (\u0394tDQSCK) [3] due to the lack of a delay locked loop (DLL) in LPDDR4 DRAM [4]. Furthermore, the reference voltage on DRAM and the duty cycle of both DQ and DQS are initially calibrated to increase the valid window margin (VWM) during write operations. VWM is the time interval where all DQs remain valid before and after DQS edge in order to capture DQs correctly.",

A low-supply transceiver is preferred, especially for mobile DRAM interfaces, for low-power consumption while maintaining a high-speed interface for transmission of image data [1]. To reduce transmitter power in single-ended transceivers, both the supply voltage and the signal swing are reduced: 0.8V and 200mV, or below [2]. However, with a small signal swing the low-supply voltage limits the maximum data rate that can be handled by the receiver (RX); the maximum data rate reported is below 10Gb/s with a supply voltage of 0.8V in 65nm CMOS [2-4]. In a conventional RX at a low-supply voltage, the maximum data rate is limited by the small gm/C of the RX front-end circuit. To eliminate this gm/C constraint, this work proposes a time-based RX for 12Gb/s operation at 0.8V.",

        "abstract": "Mobile DRAMs are essential to support memory-intensive operations for smartphones and tablet PCs [1, 2]. Since mobile DRAM standard (LPDDR), for the next generation, targets the speed specification of 51.2GB/s, its I/O interface demands high bandwidth, low power and high efficiency. Single-ended signaling has been used for LPDDR interfaces due to 100% pin efficiency. However, as the data rate increases simultaneous switching noise (SSN) limits the bandwidth. Although differential signaling can effectively remove SSN, it suffers from a pin efficiency drop of 50%, requiring that the signal bandwidth be doubled. To address this issue, differential coding schemes that encode signals over multiple channels have been explored to achieve pin efficiency and SSN robustness [4]. This paper presents a 1V 15.6Gb/s C-PHY transceiver using tri-level signaling that consumes only 7.8mW, resulting in an energy-efficiency of 0.5pJ/b. Such a high efficiency is achieved by the use of a tri-level signaling, which is from C-PHY encoding scheme of MIPI alliance standards, in combination with an active-ground tri-level transmitter and a crosstalk-cancelled low-power receiver.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for memory performance has grown rapidly due to the increasing number of cores on a single CPU, along with the integration of graphics processing units and other accelerators. Caching has been a very effective way to relieve bandwidth demand and to reduce average memory latency. As shown by the cache feature table in Fig. 23.9.1, there is a big latency gap between SRAM caches in the CPU and the external DRAM main memory. As a key element for future computing systems, the last level cache (LLC) should have a high random access bandwidth, a low random access latency, a density of 1 to 8Gb, and all signal pads located on one side of the chip [1]. A logic-process-based solution was proposed [2], but it is not scalable, and has a high standby current due to its need for frequent refresh. HBM2 was also proposed [3], but its row latency is not better than conventional DRAM, and its random-access bandwidth is still limited by tFAW, as shown in Fig. 23.9.1. This paper describes the high-bandwidth low-latency (HBLL) RAM design: how it overcomes these challenges and meets requirements in a cost-effective way.",

Several popular standards are defined for IoT, e.g., IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), where they envision massive numbers of interconnected sensors; however, the cost of replacing/recharging batteries can become an impediment to their massive deployment. In this work, aggressively improving the transceiver energy efficiency, lowering the supply, and simultaneously reducing the cost (die area) of the design are our primary goals. Hence, we propose a digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO)-based phase-tracking RX, which efficiently combines frequency downconversion, channel selection, carrier generation and signal demodulation, all of which lead to an ultra-low-power, low-voltage and low-cost RX.",

        "abstract": "Digital receiver (RX) arrays featuring ADCs at each element enable massive multi-in-multi-out (MIMO) applications, but since spatial interference rejection is absent in the RF/analog domain, RF/analog/ADC dynamic range is challenged in an environment where strong and weak spatially distinct in-band signals co-exist. Recent MIMO RX array works [1,2] attempt to mitigate this problem with (single) spatial notch suppression in the RF/analog domain, while still maintaining multiple outputs to support MIMO. However, multiple spatial interference signals at different power levels can be present, and reflections and scattering can make the power distribution in the spatial domain more hostile. A single spatial notch is insufficient in such realistic scenarios. Secondly, the notch suppression bandwidth (BW) is typically limited, as is the case with conventional cancellation architectures. Thirdly, reconfigurable wideband MIMO RX arrays that rely on impedance translation concepts in RF switched-capacitor circuits seldom operate effectively beyond 2GHz in CMOS [1].",

        "abstract": "LTE-advanced wireless receivers require high-linearity up-front filtering to prevent corruption of the in-band signals by strong out-of-band (OOB) signals and self-interference from the transmitter. SAW duplexer filters are generally used for this purpose, but supporting the plethora of existing and new bands becomes troublesome with separate filters for each band. In this paper we explore the possibility of combining an isolator with on-chip filtering. However, even with 15dB isolation, the on-chip filter needs to deal with up to +10dBm TX leakage and -15dBm OOB blocking, which requires an extremely high IIP3 around +50dBm and IIP2 around +90dBm. Recently inductorless tunable N-path-filter-based receivers achieved >10dBm compression point and good IIP3 of 20 to 30dBm. In order to further improve the receiver linearity to approach the extremely high IIP3 requirement for a SAW-less receiver, a high-linearity N-path bandpass/notch filter topology and receiver architecture are proposed in this paper.",

On-body thermoelectric (~50\u03bcW/cm2) is a maturing energy source but delivers a deeply low and inconstant output voltage (0.05 to 0.3V) hindering its utility. With the limited power efficiency of ultra-low-voltage (ULV) boost converters (64% in [1]), there is a rising interest in developing ULV radios that can operate directly at the energy-harvester output, reducing the waste of energy and active-sleep latency. The 2.4GHz receiver in [2] validates 0.3V operation, but is a non-standard design without I/Q demodulation. Also, its focus is on the active power (1.6mW) assuming its 0.3V supply is constant.",

        "abstract": "Wake-up receivers (WuRXs) are low-power radios that continuously monitor the RF environment to wake up a higher-power radio upon detection of a predetermined RF signature. Prior-art WuRXs have 100s of kHz of bandwidth with low signature-to-wake-up-signal latency to help synchronize communication amongst nominally asynchronous wireless devices. However, applications such as unattended ground sensors and smart home appliances wake-up infrequently in an event-driven manner, and thus WuRX bandwidth and latency are less critical; instead, the most important metrics are power consumption and sensitivity. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art WuRXs utilizing direct envelope-detecting and IF/uncertain-IF architectures achieve only modest sensitivity at low-power (e.g., -39dBm at 104nW ), or achieve excellent sensitivity at higher-power (e.g., -97 dBm at 99 \u03bcW [3]) via active IF gain elements. Neither approach meets the needs of next-generation event-driven sensing networks.This paper presents a 0.4 V 113.5 MHz OOK-modulated WuRX that achieves -69 dBm sensitivity with only 4.5 nW of power by: reducing the baseband signal bandwidth to 300 Hz, suitable for many event-driven applications, to aggressively filter noise; employing a high-Q transformer and filter that passively amplifies the voltage of the incoming RF waveform by 25dB and filters adjacent channel noise and interferers; simultaneously demodulating and amplifying the wake-up signal via a high-impedance dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) envelope detector (ED) with subthreshold active-inductor biasing; digitizing the ED output via a regenerative comparator with kickback elimination; generating the baseband clock via a 0.9pJ/cycle 1.1nW relaxation oscillator; decoding the received OOK signal modulated with a custom 16b codeword using a high-Vt subthreshold digital baseband correlator; and operating all circuits at 0.4V - o minimize static and dynamic power.",

        "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is gaining momentum, and the ultra-low-power (ULP) RF transceiver is one of the key enablers. Generation of the local oscillator (LO) consumes a significant share of the total energy of these ULP transceivers which are typically powered by small batteries. Therefore, a fractional-N PLL needs to perform LO frequency synthesis and modulation with a very stringent power budget, i.e., below 1mW [1]. A digital PLL is favored in these applications because of the benefit of small area, which is also a critical cost consideration in IoT. On the other hand, the LO quality generated by these ULP PLLs cannot be compromised, and it needs to fulfil the RF requirements defined in the IoT standards, e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Although the integrated phase error is less stringent in IoT standards, the spectral purity requirements remain critical in order to fulfill the regional spectrum regulations, e.g., FCC. A high fractional spur level due to the non-linearity in PLLs (e.g., from a TDC) introduces the unwanted emission. In this work, we present a ULP dividerless digital PLL with a power-efficient spur-mitigation technique. Furthermore, one of the critical issues of the dividerless (or sub-sampling) PLLs, the lack of frequency capture capability without the assistance of an extra power-hungry frequency-locked-loop (FLL), is addressed and mitigated by the proposed digital phase unwrap technique.",

While carrier aggregation (CA) improves data-rates, it requires wider aggregated signal bandwidth that limits the number of users that can be serviced. Techniques like 256QAM and 4\u00d74 MIMO are attractive because improvements do not need wider signal bandwidth. To support 256QAM and 4\u00d74 MIMO for the 5GHz band, we need IPN better than -48dBc or 155fsec rms. A digital fractional-N PLL that achieves 137fsec rms jitter integrating from 10kHz to 10MHz (or 142fsec 1kHz to 10 MHz) with a -78.6dBc near integer-N fractional spur is presented. We have introduced a TDC chopping technique, fine-conversion through SARADCs and TDC nonlinearity calibration to improve IPN and fractional spurs.",

        "abstract": "Low-power sensor interfaces play a key role in monitoring industrial system reliability in hostile environments. They are exposed to destructive surge voltages, which are caused by ground current spikes from operation transitions of machinery and motor drives, endangering circuit functionality. Employing galvanic isolation is thus imperative to protect the sensor analog front end (AFE) from severe damage. However, the use of an isolation barrier presents several challenges. Without a wired connection to the sensor AFE, power/data must be transferred through the barrier via magnetic or capacitive coupling. Moreover, size and cost are constrained in such applications. In [1], an isolated DC/DC converter is used, which delivers up to 2W with 80% efficiency, but at the cost of bulky external micro-henry transformers. To avoid a large form-factor solution, the transformers can be integrated, but efficiency is sacrificed and cost is added. In [2-3], the operating frequency of the integrated transformers is ~300MHz for size reduction. However, at such a high frequency, the switching power loss (PSW) is greater than 10s of mW, reducing efficiency below 30%. On the other hand, capacitive isolation, usually used in digital links [4], replaces polyimide-based transformers with integrated thick dielectric capacitors. It represents a major improvement due to size and cost savings as a result of integration on silicon.",

        "abstract": "As power efficiency becomes essential in automotive applications, DC-DC converters are widely employed [1]. However, size and thermal limits have made it challenging to continue using standard CMOS-based converters. Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs, on the other hand, have a much higher conductivity with small size/capacitance in comparison to silicon FETs, enabling a highly efficient power conversion at high switching frequency (fSW). However, there are several issues that must be resolved before using GaN in automotive. High fSW incurs larger di/dt and dv/dt transitions which injects high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise into the input bus. This creates unwanted noise or even a malfunction in a safety-critical system. A bulky input filter can reduce EMI, but it greatly increases size and cost. Several techniques [2-5] are reported to mitigate EMI. Frequency hopping using discrete frequencies is proposed in [2], but cannot spread the frequency evenly to lower the peak noise effectively. Alternatively, a series resistor is typically added at the gate of the GaN FET to slow down the transition [3-4]. However, the switching loss is dramatically increased. To mitigate this, adjustable driving strength is proposed in [5]. Unfortunately, the sensing and driver delays confine its use in low fSW applications, where the switch node rising time is several tens or hundreds of ns. Another issue of high fSW operation is that it causes significant current and voltage spikes due to the parasitics at the drain/source of the high side GaN FET (MH), which could lead to GaN VDS breakdown or damage on logic-level FETs. Thus, EMI noise suppression and reliable operation of GaN FETs remain as major challenges in realizing high fSW power converters for automotive-use.",

        "abstract": "Chip based digital isolators are being developed for higher speed and higher isolation capabilities [1, 2]. These make use of various coupling mechanisms such as capacitive coupling [3] and transformer coupling [4]. A limitation of these technologies is that they need to maintain a low separation (distance through insulation DTI<;30\u03bcm) through high quality insulators (oxides, polyamides) in order to achieve data rate and isolation performance [2]. These require expensive special process development and special packaging techniques to meet reinforced isolation recommended by IEC 60747-5-5 and VDE 0884-10. Other high-speed die-to-die communication techniques implemented using millimeter-wave and optical solutions are expensive and not designed for isolation. In this work, an isolation technique is proposed where two standard 180nm CMOS dies placed side by side with DTI of more than 500\u03bcm, and co-packaged using regular planar MCM flow with package mold compound being the isolation material, achieve asynchronous bidirectional link with >24kV surge isolation capability and greater than 500Mb/s at 175pJ/b. Channel gain is maximized using resonance. Gain is decoupled from channel bandwidth by resetting the channel state variables. This helps in enhancing data rate well beyond what is implied by the bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Successful power supply noise mitigation requires a system-level approach that includes design and modeling of the mitigation circuits with the power delivery network (PDN) on the chip, the chip module, the backplane, and the voltage regulator module (VRM). Traditionally, periodic square-wave activity patterns with all cores in sync, which yield low-frequency (LF) or mid-frequency (MF) impedance peaks associated with the backplane and chip/module, respectively, are considered to give rise to the worst case power supply noise. However, voltage droops that are both deeper and faster at a single victim core are created when cores change activity in more complicated patterns, termed as perfect storms in this work. These patterns excite high-frequency (HF) modes that are not stimulated when all cores switch simultaneously, and require an accurate model of the packaged chip, including effective core-to-core inductances due to currents traveling between cores through low-resistance module planes.",

        "abstract": "Clock network optimization is substantially affected by the operating voltage VDD, as the clock skew is dominated by different mechanisms and has a different balance between wire and repeater delay at different VDD (Fig. 26.3.1). At above-threshold VDD, deep clock networks with several levels of repeaters are needed to control the clock slope in wires [1]. At sub-threshold VDD, shallow networks are needed as the gate delay dominates, and the random clock skew approximately grows proportionally to the square root of the number of levels [2]. At such VDD, the skew of clock networks designed at above-threshold VDD is much larger than at the nominal voltage VDD,nom, thus assuring a reasonable skew budget across a wide range of VDD is challenging [1-3]. To date, clock skew at low VDD has been mitigated via moderately deep networks with long-channel LVT buffers [1], design methodologies [2], [4], and voltage-adaptive delay insertion across different clock domains [3]. However, no voltage adaption has been performed within a clock domain.",

        "abstract": "Clock distribution in modern SoCs consumes a significant fraction of total chip power. To reduce clock distribution power, resonant clocking schemes, where an inductive reactance is used to cancel the capacitive reactance of global clock networks at a given resonance frequency, fo, have been proposed. Conventionally, such schemes are only suitable at high multi-GHz frequencies in order to be able to place the employed inductors on chip [1, 2]. Since many modern energy-efficient SoC designs optimize for clock frequencies <;2GHz, with DVFS techniques bringing the core clock frequencies and the supply voltages VDD to the MHz and near-threshold regimes, respectively, there is a need to develop low-power clock distribution schemes that can work across increasingly wider operating ranges. Recent work in quasi-continuous resonant clocking has proposed intermittent cancelation of global clock-tree capacitance during edge transitions, however, such techniques require large off-chip inductors and are limited to 0.98MHz [3] and 150MHz [4], respectively, owing to the need to operate well below resonance (i.e., <; fo/10). Thus, while prior-art has shown power reduction for targeted applications, they all require large on- or off-chip magnetics, and do not meet the MHz-to-GHz frequency-range needs of modern DVFS-enabled SoCs. To address these problems, this paper introduces a fully integrated adiabatic clocking scheme that efficiently synthesizes n-step clock waveforms from 1MHz to 2GHz via a switched-capacitor DC-AC multi-level inverter topology, theoretically reducing power by 1/n without using any magnetic component.",

        "abstract": "Closed-loop neuromodulation with simultaneous stimulation and sensing is desired to administer therapy in patients suffering from drug-resistant neurological ailments. However, stimulation generates large artifacts at the recording sites, which saturate traditional front-ends. The common-mode (CM) artifact can be ~500mV, and the differential-mode (DM) artifact is 50 to 100mV. This work presents a neural recording chopper amplifier that can tolerate 80mVpp DM and 650mVpp CM artifacts in a signal band of 1Hz to 5kHz. To digitize a 2mVpp neural signal to 8b accompanied by an 80mVpp DM artifact requires a linearity of 80dB. Neural recording front-ends also need to function within a power budget of 3 to 5\u03bcW/ch, input-referred noise of 4 to 8\u03bcVrms, DC input impedance Zin>1G\u03a9 and high-pass cutoff of 1Hz [1,2]. Prior work has addressed power and noise [2-6], but has low Zin and limited input signal range, making them incapable of performing true closed-loop operation.",

        "abstract": "There has been recent research into continuous monitoring of the quantitative anesthesia (ANES) depth level for safe surgery [1]. However, the current ANES depth monitoring approach, bispectral index (BIS) [3], uses only EEG from the frontal lobe, and it shows critical limitations in the monitoring of ANES depth such as signal distortion due to electrocautery, EMG and dried gel, and false response to the special types of anesthetic drugs [3]. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is complementary to EEG [2], and can not only compensate for the distorted depth level, but also assess the effects of various anesthetic drugs. In spite of its importance, a unified ANES monitoring system using EEG/NIRS together has not been reported because NIRS signals have widely different dynamic ranges (10pA to 10nA), and also signal level variations from person to person and environment are not manageable without closed-loop control (CLC). In this paper, a multimodal head-patch system that simultaneously measures EEG and NIRS on the frontal lobe is proposed for accurate ANES depth monitoring. A 60dB dynamic range logarithmic TIA (logTIA) is adopted to amplify the photodiode (PD) signal and a CLC driver is used to compensate for the human-to-human variations. Also, an LNA with high Zin (1G\u03a9) and wide electrode DC-offset (EDO) cancelation range (350mV) is integrated to obtain reliable EEG signals.",

        "abstract": "Accurate capture and efficient control of neurological disorders such as epileptic seizures that often originate in multiple regions of the brain, requires neural interface microsystems with an ever-increasing need for higher channel counts. Addressing this demand within the limited energy and area of brain-implantable medical devices necessitates a search for new circuit architectures. In the conventional designs [1-5], the channel area is dominated by the bulky coupling capacitors and/or capacitor banks of the in-channel ADC, both unavoidable due to the channel architecture, and unscalable with CMOS technology. Additionally, channel power consumption, typically dominated by the LNA, cannot be reduced lower than a certain limit without sacrificing gain and/or noise performance. In this paper, we present a 64-channel wireless closed-loop neurostimulator with a compact and energy-efficient channel architecture that performs both amplification and digitization in a single \u0394\u03a3-based neural ADC, while removing rail-to-rail input DC offset using a digital feedback loop. The channel area and power consumption depend only on the active components and switching frequency, respectively, making the design both technology- and frequency-scalable.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging technique. It employs a strong static magnetic field (1.5 to 10.5T for human imaging) to split the spin states of the 1H nuclei in the body, and RF excitation to induce transitions and coherence among them. Gradient fields are superimposed to modulate the 1H resonance frequency, which enables spatially distinguishable signals to be picked up by RF receive coils. A high-field MRI provides better sensitivity and resolution but requires better receivers (RX), as signal DR and 1H resonance increase (128MHz for 3T, 300MHz for 7T). Overall sensitivity and imaging speed can be enhanced by closely surrounding the target anatomy with tens of RX coils (as in MIMO) [1], at the expense of as many shielded RF cables to carry the information out of the field. Progress in PCB size has allowed multi-channel RX to be placed inside the magnetic field (in-bore), reducing the RF cable length to less than 1m [2,3]. Ultimately, the RX should be placed directly on-coil to avoid bulky coaxial cables and improve patient comfort and safety by acquiring data in-bore and sending them digitally to the MRI scanner via an optical fiber link. The latter is cheap, flexible and insensitive to magnetic fields. The immediate vicinity of the coils and the patient is, however, a hostile as well as sensitive electromagnetic environment, which tolerates only the smallest of PCBs and virtually no magnetic material in its components. Integration of the full RX chain in a CMOS chip, which is small, non-magnetic and low power, holds the key to the next wave of compact MRI coil arrays for advanced medical imaging. This paper presents a fully integrated dual-receiver RFIC for coil arrays intended for (ultra-) high field (1.5 to 10.5T and 64 to 450MHz) scanners for clinical MRI, where requirements are considerably stricter than previously reported transceiver ICs [4,5] on palm-held NMR devices for spectroscopy or - ab-on-chip applications.",

        "abstract": "A variety of emerging applications in medical ultrasound rely on 3D volumetric imaging, calling for dense 2D transducer arrays with thousands of elements. Due to this high channel count, the traditional per-element cable interface used for 1D arrays is no longer viable. To address this issue, recent work has proven the viability of flip-chip bonding or direct transducer integration. This shifts the burden to a CMOS substrate, which must provide dense signal conditioning and processing before the massively parallel image data can be pushed off chip. A common approach for data reduction is to employ subarray beamforming (BF), which applies delay and sum operations within a group of pixels. To implement such functionality within the tight pixel pitch, prior works have implemented the delays using simple S/H circuits or analog filters, and typically suffer from a combination of issues related to limited delay, coarse delay resolution and limited SNR.",

The system is composed of a main unit and probe connected via coaxial cables. The probe is very small because medical technicians laboriously grab and manipulate it for a long time. To avoid image obscurity depending on medical technicians, high-speed and high-resolution 3D/4D imaging is necessary. For this reason, several thousands of lead bulk piezoelectric material transducers (TD) need to be squeezed into the small probe.

        "abstract": "The successive approximation register (SAR) ADC is the most energy efficient architecture with moderate conversion rate and resolution. However, its comparator noise limits its resolution without sacrificing power efficiency. The delta-sigma modulator (DSM) is the most popular architecture for achieving high SNDR due to its oversampling, but the bulky operational amplifier (op-amp) makes it area inefficient. In LTE Advanced, the bandwidth (BW) of downlink ADCs needs to be configured according to the number of inter-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation (NCCA), which motivates us to combine the benefits of both architectures to reduce area and power consumption simultaneously with high SNDR. The noise-shaping SAR ADC [1] suppresses the comparison and quantization noise in signal BW using a simple cascaded FIR-IIR filter, which obviates the need for a power-hungry low-noise comparator or high-performance op-amp. To some extent, the noise-shaping SAR ADC is a hybrid of DSM and SAR ADCs. Hence, it has the potential to achieve the high resolution and good power efficiency of DSM and SAR ADCs, respectively. However, the passive sampling in an FIR filter introduces considerable thermal noise to the ADC, making it difficult to achieve a high SNR. This work presents an energy-efficient noise-shaping SAR ADC that uses a gain-enhanced dynamic amplifier and some capacitors to construct a low-noise dynamic FIR-IIR filter. The prototype achieves a peak SNDR of 79.74dB over a 5MHz BW with a power consumption of 0.46mW from a 1V supply.",

        "abstract": "Quantizers are key building blocks in both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) delta-sigma modulators (DSMs). Among various types of quantizers, noise-shaping quantizers such as VCO-based quantizers and noise-shaped integrating quantizers (NSIQ) [1] are attractive solutions since they provide an additional order of quantization noise shaping. On one hand, VCO-based quantizers are relatively fast, but are often non-linear. On the other hand, NSIQs suffer from a tradeoff between the counting clock speed and resolution, but can be very linear. Nevertheless, the NSIQ offers an interesting benefit that the quantization error is inherently available in both time and voltage domains. Thus, the NSIQ can be easily extended to provide an additional order of noise shaping. In this paper, we propose a double noise-shaping quantizer (DNSQ) incorporating an NSIQ and a gated-ring-oscillator-based (GRO-based) quantizer [2] that not only provides 6b quantization levels with a back-end digital integrator [3], but also offers two extra orders of noise-shaping.",

        "abstract": "High-BW continuous-time \u0394\u03a3 modulators (CTDSMs), which directly inject excess loop delay compensation (ELDC) at the quantizer input, suffer from the over-range issue due to the 1+\u03b1z-1 transfer function of the local feedback loop, where \u03b1 is the zero-order path coefficient [1-2]. For example, the swing or number of quantization levels will be doubled if \u03b1=1 is chosen. On the other hand, injecting the compensation current at the input of the last integrator requires an additional DAC and extra power to minimize excess phase shift [3]. The phase-feedback VCO-based integrating quantizer (VCOIQ) in [4] suggests a unique feature to compensate ELD in the phase domain. In this work, the VCO outputs are rotated directly in the digital domain to implement phase-domain ELDC (PD-ELDC) [5] without overloading any previous stages. Though VCOIQ is essentially a time-domain flash quantizer with a potentially higher number of quantization levels than voltage-domain counterparts, prior work utilized 5b or less when embedded within a CTDSM. The requirement of the low-complexity thermometric DAC limits the maximum number of bits that can be used to fulfill the SQNR specification. In this work, rotating splitters (RSPT) and a segmented DAC are used to increase the VCOIQ resolution to 7b. This arrangement decouples VCOIQ optimization from DAC design constraints and fully exploits the advantage of time-domain quantization. By leveraging the techniques mentioned above, this CTDSM achieves 125MHz BW while operating at 2.15GHz. The measured SNDR/DR are 71.9dB/74.8dB at the input frequency of 1/3 BW.",

        "abstract": "In high-speed pipeline or pipelined-SAR ADCs, conventional opamp-based residue amplifiers consume significant amounts of power due to stringent settling speed and accuracy requirements. A recent alternative approach employs a dynamic amplifier [1] to achieve a more efficient form of settling, stemming from the fact that slewing is more power efficient than exponential settling (Fig. 28.4.1). For example, at 6b accuracy, the setting time of a dynamic amplifier is about a quarter of that of a conventional opamp (non-slewing) with the same bias current. However, the efficiency of the dynamic amplifier is accompanied by a few undesirable features such as ill-defined gain, and PVT and clock jitter sensitivity. In particular, as the voltage gain of a dynamic amplifier relates to the non-constant transconductance, load capacitance and slewing time (gmA, CLA and tA, respectively, in Fig. 28.4.1), it can drift dramatically with PVT variations. One way to compensate for gain instability is to employ continuous background calibration. However, most of these calibrations require some constraints on the statistical property of the input signal and suffer from long convergence time and design complexity. This paper presents a simple analog approach to effectively stabilize the voltage gain over PVT variations.",

As many applications cannot tolerate input swings \u22651Vppd, comparator noise limits the SNDR of SAR ADCs, making gain stages necessary for higher SNDR - either as comparator pre-amplifiers or between pipelined stages. Pre-amplifiers significantly reduce the conversion speed of the ADC, but they provide maximum SNDR because linearity of the amplifier is irrelevant. An interstage amplifier for pipelining best suits mid-resolution SAR ADCs, where the required linearity is limited. Moreover, pipelining results in higher conversion speeds and power efficiency because the gain stage is used only once per conversion [1]. This work presents a pipelined-SAR ADC architecture that exceeds the conversion speed of previous pipelined and single-stage SAR ADCs. The ADC achieves 50dB SNDR and 950MS/s at 2.26mW, and 1.5GS/s at 6.92mW on an area of 0.0016mm2.",

High-speed (fs>100MS/s) and high-resolution (ENOB>9.5b) ADCs are essential for leading-edge wireless SoCs, given the bandwidth and PAPR specifications. Also, low power dissipation (FoM<;20fJ/conv) is crucial for mobile applications. A number of pipelined-SAR ADCs have been presented which satisfy these design targets [1-3]. However, in deep submicron CMOS, design of a high DC-gain opamp for the MDAC is a serious obstacle due to reduced intrinsic transistor gain and sub-1V supply voltage. Hence, all designs utilize digital calibration to counter gain error and tolerate the use of a low-gain amplifier. Calibration times of at least several tens of ms are required, resulting in lengthy start-up times and reduced SoC power efficiency. Moreover, such calibration cannot track sudden supply voltage variations and suppressing such fluctuations with bypass capacitors significantly impacts chip cost [1-2]. Furthermore, amplifier non-linearity remains unsolved; with lower supply voltages, the limited amplifier swing tightens SAR noise requirements.",

The papers presented in this section highlight developments in high-speed optical and electrical transceivers and clocking circuitry. It starts with a 64Gb/s NRZ optical receiver that utilizes a self-referenced bandwidth-optimized TIA co-optimized with a speculative 1-tap DFE to achieve \u22125.5dBm OMA sensitivity. The next paper describes a transmitter and receiver for 100Gb/s coherent networks with integrated 4\u00d764GS/s 8b ADCs and DACs. This is followed by a paper that demonstrates the first 40Gb/s optical PAM-4 transmitter in zero-change 45nm SOI CMOS. The fourth paper proposes a new phase-domain equalization scheme, which compensates for more than 19dB of channel loss at 16Gb/s. The next paper presents clock generation, recovery, and distribution techniques for flexible-rate transceivers that can be programmed to operate at any rate from 3 to 10Gb/s. The session concludes with a paper that utilizes a time-division dual calibration scheme to improve reference spur performance of injection-locked all-digital PLLs.",

        "abstract": "At rates of 100Gb/s and above, CMOS DSP-based transceivers integrated with high-sampling-rate data converters are critical to realize the phase-sensitive modulation schemes based on coherent detection that are essential to metro and long-haul networks [1]. To support dual-polarization QPSK format, quad low-power DACs and ADCs are needed and precise phase alignment has to be maintained between XI, XQ, YI, and YQ channels, in order to transmit and extract the phase information in the coherent system, as shown in Fig. 29.2.1. For long-haul transmission at 100Gb/s, because of the FEC overhead, the baud rate per channel can be as high as 32Gb/s. In addition, the receiver often requires double sampling at 64GS/s for robust clock-data recovery and SNR improvement for stressed channels. Double sampling also enables the DSP to implement more complicated equalization schemes and more flexible spectrum engineering at high frequency on the transmitter side. This paper reports the receiver and transmitter fully integrated in a 100G coherent DSP chip, using 4\u00d764GS/s ADCs and DACs with 8b resolution, fabricated in a standard 20nm CMOS process.",

        "abstract": "Asymmetric links such as memory interfaces and display drivers require the transmitter to perform necessary equalization, while the receiver remains simple and has minimal or no equalization capability. Traditionally, FFE-based equalization techniques on power-efficient voltage-mode drivers have been used on the transmit end. Based on the FFE tap resolution requirement, the output driver and pre-driver are divided into multiple segments. Although such a segmented FFE implementation helps to maintain a constant output termination impedance (50\u03a9) across all tap settings, it comes at the cost of (a) increased signaling power, and (b) increased switching power since multiple segments are required to achieve desired linearity [1]. Phase domain equalization techniques, such as pulse width modulation (PWM), can equalize the channel without increasing signaling power or segmenting the output driver. However, PWM encoding requires the insertion of a precise narrow pulse in every data bit, which necessitates very wide bandwidth in the high-speed data path, resulting in poor energy efficiency [2] and difficulty in scaling PWM encoding to higher data rates [3]. For example, creating a 10% duty cycle on a 64Gb/s PWM data stream would require a pulse width of 1.5ps with less than 1ps of rise/fall time at the transmitter output. Other phase domain pre-emphasis techniques are ineffective for high-loss channels [4]. In view of these limitations, we present a new phase-domain equalization technique: integrated pulse width modulation (iPWM) in a 16Gb/s transceiver, which can equalize 19dB of channel loss, while consuming 57.3mW power. Compared to state-of-the-art PWM designs, the proposed iPWM scheme achieves 36\u00d7 better energy efficiency for the same data rate [2], and 3.2\u00d7 higher data rate for the same energy efficiency [3].",

        "abstract": "A point-to-point interface with a clock embedded scheme (CES) in Fig. 29.5.1 is generally adopted in an intra-panel interface due to the poor signal integrity of the multi-drop topology, data and clock channel skews and EMI emission from the forwarded clock signal channels. Clock recovery in RX without a reference clock channel is usually carried out using one of two type of data encoding schemes, embedded clock with dummy clock bits [1-2,5] or ensured transition density with data encoding such as 8B10B encoding [3]. However, these two schemes reduce the effective bandwidth because they require over 20% overhead in the data stream. Although highly efficient signaling schemes have been introduced recently in the literature [4] to cope with the physical limitations of the process and channel, it is difficult to adopt these multi-level signaling schemes in intra-panel interfaces where there is a highly resistive channel of Chip-On-Glass and a ground bouncing problem [5] due to different voltage domains (1V and 8V-30V) for serial link and source drivers. This paper introduces a braid clock signaling (BCS) scheme which has the following advantages: 1) clock information without redundant bits; 2) NRZ signal levels for high voltage margin; and 3) low EMI emission with a random data dependent encoding and a spread transition scheme.",

        "abstract": "Serial link transceivers that can operate across a wide range of data rates offer flexibility and rapid realization of single-chip multi-standard solutions. The ability to independently control the data rate of each lane in a multi-lane transceiver with fine granularity is also valuable. The implementation of such transceivers would require analog front-ends and clocking circuits that can operate over a wide range of frequencies. As a result, compared to transceivers that are optimized to operate at one single data rate, flexible-rate transceivers are power and area hungry. Because a single PLL cannot generate clocks across the entire interface operating range, use multiple LC tanks, carefully optimized waveform shaping circuits, power hungry clock distribution, and complex frequency planning methods. In this paper, we present a clocking strategy for efficient clock generation, recovery, and distribution in flexible-rate transceivers. Using a fixed-frequency low-jitter clock provided by an integer-N PLL, fractional frequencies are generated/recovered locally using multi-phase fractional-N clock multipliers, which offers the following advantages. First, clock distribution power is reduced because only a single-phase fixed-frequency clock is needed. Second, it can provide multiple phases with infinite phase shifting capability across a wide frequency range without using phase interpolators. Finally, by maximizing the bandwidth of a local ring-based clock multiplier, it achieves jitter performance comparable to that of LC-based multipliers. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS process, the prototype transceiver can be programmed to operate at any rate from 3-to10 Gb/s. At 10 Gb/s, integrated jitter of the transmitter output and recovered clock is 360 fsrms and 758 fsrms, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A clock generator using an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) offers remarkable jitter performance with low-overhead of additional circuits such as injection switches. Because the injection clock cleans the edge of the oscillator in every injection period, jitter accumulation is avoided. However, the ILO alone causes a severe reference spur owing to the mismatch between the desired oscillation frequency set by the injected reference and the free-running frequency that could change over the process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. For this reason, continuously tuning the free-running oscillation frequency, FOSC, to nullify the frequency error, FERR, is required. Here FERR is the frequency difference between FOSC and the multiplication ratio, N, times the reference frequency, FREF. For minimizing such performance degradations, techniques such as pulse gating and replica-delay cells have been presented. While the minimization of FERR is achieved, the path delay mismatch between the injection and the phase detector remains unsolved, limiting the spur reduction capability. Thus, a precise calibration for equalizing the delay mismatch is required for achieving low spur performance. This paper proposes an injection-locked all-digital phase-locked loop (IL-ADPLL) with a time-division dual calibration (TDDC) scheme for reducing the reference spur with robust performance against PVT variations.",

When artificially-general intelligence is capable of recursive self-improvement, a hypothetical \u2018runaway effect\u2019 \u2014 an intelligence explosion \u2014 might happen, yielding an intelligence surpassing all current human control or understanding. This event is known as the technological singularity; this is the point beyond which events may become unpredictable or even unfathomable to human intelligence. This panel will picture the current state of the art for AI, deep learning and robotics, and try to predict where this technology is heading.",

        "abstract": "Quantum engineering is an emerging discipline, which involves studies of materials, devices, circuits, and architectures that are necessary to develop quantum-based systems. Recently, quantum computing has received significant attention, and large investments have been made in this field. Is this interest pure hype, or should we revise our views on computing? This Panel will address this question as well as various others: is our current understanding of classical electronics sufficient for the challenges ahead or should we all rethink the way we design circuits and systems? Will quantum engineering ultimately emerge as the next wave in research and products or will the economy of scale continue to rule? Will Moore's Law compete with, or enable, new quantum technologies? Panelists' summary statements are presented. A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Summary statements from the panelists are provided.",

        "abstract": "This Evening Session is not about circuits or chip architectures; rather it is a technical session on economics driving the semiconductor industry. Business leaders (CEOs, CFOs, VCs, Investors) use very sophisticated financial engineering and analysis tools to make decisions that sometimes do not appear to make sense to designers working in the technology trenches. In this evening session, several eminent speakers from the business community will present various behind-the-scenes technological and business aspects that lead to decisions which can have a profound impact on both the technology and the lives of circuit designers.",

        "abstract": "Assisted driving has already arrived. However, widespread adaption of fully autonomous driving is still facing challenges. Will it arrive sooner, later, or ever? Is adoption still limited by technology, or are we simply waiting for the public or the infrastructure to be ready? This panel will discuss the introduction of autonomous driving from various angles. The goal of the discussion will be to arrive at an understanding of what needs to be done to enable mainstream adoption.",

        "abstract": "After the success of this evening event in 2016, Survey Says! returns to entertain the ISSCC audience. Two teams of panelists, all data-converter experts, compete to guess the most popular responses to a series of survey questions. While similar to the US game show \u201cFamily Feud\u201d, in this event the audience's participation is also solicited to make the evening more amusing and controversial than the TV game show. This year a new set of survey questions, both fun and technical, will be featured. Survey questions probe both professional and personal sides, for example: \u201cWhat do you like about your job?\u201d or \u201cHow do you get more time to tape-out?\u201d or \u201cWhy does your project fall behind?\u201d. The contestants may ask for the audience's help after two failed guesses. This is an opportunity to learn how others in the field think in various situations and also to see how even the most experienced experts can struggle to guess even obvious answers when under pressure.",

        "abstract": "A critical dominant trend in the evolution of the electronics industry is the incredible growth in the sheer number of devices that are being deployed annually across a wide range of applications. Many of these devices are being leveraged to provide interfaces between the analog world and the digital infrastructure that supports the Internet of Everything, providing environmental sensing data to drive more effective pollution management, component data to enhance equipment lifetime and automate repair scheduling, process data to improve manufacturing effectiveness, and much, much more. The proliferation of devices also extends to enabling health care applications, improved logistics capability, and, very broadly, enabling the optimization of compute workloads across complete application stacks. Low power analog circuits are the critical enablers for such applications, and nano-powered analog circuits are and will be the critical enablers for a further wide range of emerging applications.",

        "abstract": "The reduction of the power consumption of all electronic functions is a continuous endeavor. This endeavor requires judicious comparison of analog and digital realizations from the point of view of performance per unit of power consumed. Analog signal processing offers the advantage that power consumption can be minimized at both very low and very high frequencies. This short course explores the limits in reduction of power consumption for important analog blocks. The first presentation defines the physical limits of supply voltages and power consumption based on present-day technologies and transistor models. The second presentation addresses the limits of amplifiers and filters. For all circuit blocks, figures of merit are derived, followed by circuit techniques to improve them. In the third presentation, new opportunities are identified to reduce the power consumption in all types of analog-to-digital converters, with emphasis on the improvement of the FOM with technology. Finally, in the fourth presentation, power minimization techniques are discussed for power management blocks such as dc-dc converters.",

        "abstract": "In the past two decades Flash memory grew from a novelty technology to a powerful disruptor that has profoundly transformed consumer electronics and mobile computing. This was made possible through relentless cost reductions leveraging technology scaling through 19 generations of Flash memory in just 24 years, outpacing Moore's Law. NAND Flash, System-Flash, and multilevel cells (MLC) were critical elements in establishing the foundations for today's $25 billion Flash industry. Flash enabled, and in turn benefitted from new mega markets in digital consumer electronics, and more recently, from the ascendency of mobile phones and tablets as the ultimate convergence device for billions of consumers worldwide. The author began working in the semiconductor industry in the early 1970s and participated in the growth of the non volatile memory (NVM) industry [1], first as a device physicist, then as an entrepreneur and businessman. Section 2 of this paper provides the author's personal recollections of the key milestones and innovation breakthroughs that made Flash memory such a game changer. Section 3 describes the enormous impact that Flash memory has had on Consumer Electronics and Mobile Computing. Section 4 discusses some of the major challenges and opportunities ahead for the Flash industry.",

        "abstract": "Semiconductor technologies, products and solutions have long played a key role in improving efficiency along the whole energy chain and the importance of this role will continually increase. The greatest future energy saving will come from the adoption of semiconductor technologies, especially in buildings, which are forecasted to consume around 50% less electricity in 2030. In this area, savings will come from three sources: more efficient appliances (with an estimated 60% reduction), intelligent lighting and HVAC (with up to 50% reduction), and increased energy-consumption consciousness at the consumer level, thanks to energy monitoring in-house systems (with up to 20% potential saving). Furthermore, the advent of the Smart Grid will contribute to energy saving and to eco-sustainability. Grid optimization, through the improved modeling and control that will be possible with the deployment of Smart Meters and Automatic Meter Infrastructures (AMI), will significantly reduce infrastructure losses. Above all, it will enable the integration of renewable sources as alternatives to traditional carbon-based sources, allowing the possibility of meeting international targets such as Europe's EU 20-20-20 target that can strongly contribute reductions in CO2 emissions and containment of global warming.",

In fact, semiconductor technology has been in the lead in the reduction of power consumption, by facilitating energy monitoring, and the controlling and managing of energy consumption. The key product in this advance has been a less-commonly-known semiconductor device called the microcontroller. That the MCU uses very little power was demonstrated for the first time by Renesas in 2006, by operating a low-power MCU from the electricity generated by 4 lemons! Subseqently, in 2011, we succeeded in operating our latest low-power MCU for 3 hours and 45 minutes using one lemon as a power source. Yet, in the future, MCUs must evolve further to save power, in widespread applications including the \"energy harvesting\" environment.",

        "abstract": "A higher performance DRAM is required by the market due to the increasing of bandwidth of networks and the rise of high-capacity multimedia content. DDR4 SDRAM is the next-generation memory that meets these demands in computing and server systems. In comparison with current DDR3 memory, the major changes are supply voltage reduction to 1.2V, pseudo open drain I/O interface, and data rate increase from 1.6 to 3.2Gb/s. To achieve high performance at low supply voltage and reduce power consumption, this work introduces new functions and describes their implementation. Data bus inversion (DBI) is employed for high-speed transactions to reduce power consumption of I/O and SSN noise. Dual-error detection, which adopts cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for DQ, and command address (CA) parity is designed to guarantee reliable transmission. GDDR5 memory also has DBI and CRC functions [1], but in this work, these schemes are implemented in a way that reduces area overhead and timing penalty. Besides these error-check functions, an enhanced gain buffer and a PVT-tolerant fetch scheme improve basic receiving ability. To meet the output jitter requirements of DDR4 SDRAM, the type of delay line for DLL is selected at initial stage according to data rate.",

        "abstract": "Mobile DRAM is widely adopted in battery-powered portable devices because of its low power. Recently, in mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs, higher performance is required to support 3D gaming mode and high-quality video. These trends lead to consideration of higher-performance DRAMs than LPDDR2, while the power budget for DRAMs for mobile devices cannot increase. DRAMs with wide I/O or serial I/O have been reviewed as candidates for over 6.4GB/s channel bandwidth. However, wide-I/O DRAMs [1] must solve issues such as stacking yield for higher density and failure analysis modeling of system-in-package (SiP), and most serial I/Os have worse I/O power efficiency than LPDDR2. For an evolutionary successor of LPDDR2, therefore, we design a 1.2V 1.6Gb/s/pin \u00d732 4Gb low-power DDR3 SDRAM (LPDDR3) with input skew calibration and enhanced refresh control schemes, achieving 6.4GB/s total data bandwidth. Most features of LPDDR3 are backward compatible with LPDDR2, except that channel termination, command-address (CA) training, and write leveling are adopted.",

Besides implementations with standard interfaces like NOR flash or LPDDR2-NVM, application-oriented approaches using PRAM as main-memory or storage-class memory have been researched [2-3]. These studies suggest that noticeable merits can be achieved by using PRAM in improving power consumption, system cost, etc. However, relatively low chip density and insufficient write bandwidth of PRAMs are obstacles to better system performance. In this paper, we present an 8Gb PRAM with 40MB/s write bandwidth featuring 8Mb sub-array core architecture with 20nm diode-switched PRAM cells [4]. When an external high voltage is applied, the write bandwidth can be extended as high as 133MB/s.",

        "abstract": "The process variation among 512 DRAM samples is more than 30%. The performance variation of general circuits is predicted to be over 60% in 2012. In general, a single-die-based DRAM has a large process variation from chip to chip, which among other parameters, causes tAC (address access time) variation in the application system. In order to reduce the tAC variation, most highspeed SDRAMs adopt a delay-locked loop (DLL) at the cost of additional area and power consumption. For TSV-based stacked dies, large tAC variantion results in higher power consumption due to short circuit current from data conflicts among shared I/Os. Since the number of I/Os for TSV-based stacked DRAM (TSV DRAM) might be 512 or more, the additional power consumption can be very high. Even though it is desirable in mobile DRAM to exclude the DLL because of the power cost, TSV DRAM for high-speed operation partially adopts a DLL in the master die. Our DLL-based data self-aligner (DBDA) reduces the data conflict time among stacked dies, consuming 283.2\u03bcW during read operation at 800Mb/s/pin. It dissipates 4.98\u03bcW in self-refresh mode with the help of leakage-current-reduction controller.",

        "abstract": "The demand for higher power efficiency and bandwidth is increasing as mobile devices keep enhancing its graphic computing and media processing capabilities. Current memory interfaces with single-wire signaling operate at 5Gb/s/pin [1] and 6Gb/s/pin [2] with the power efficiency of 17.4pJ/b/pin and 15.8pJ/b/pin, respectively. Mobile DDR memory I/O with differential signaling has better power efficiency of 6.4pJ/b/pin [3], and so does the prior dual-band interconnect (DBI) [4] with the efficiency of 5pJ/b/pin at 4.2Gb/s/pin for simultaneous bidirectional (SBD) mobile memory I/O interface. However, DBI's differential signaling is incompatible with existing standards, and it also occupies large die area for using differential transmission lines and an LC-oscillator for generating RF-carrier. To alleviate these concerns, we propose to use a Single-Transmission-Line DBI (STL-DBI) with the best figure-of-merit (FoM) defined as data rate per pin divided by the I/O-interface die area and power consumption.",

        "abstract": "As computing power and speed increases, the demand for higher memory bandwidth increases as well. Recently, the memory interface has been improved up to 20Gb/s/link [1]. Considering PCB routing area, a multi-drop bus architecture is still preferable for large memory capacity to the point-to-point connection. However, the multi-drop approach suffers from performance degradations due to reflections at each stub. To mitigate this problem, reference [2] proposes an impedance-matched bidirectional multi-drop DQ bus architecture that is difficult to realize due to smaller series resistor if more than 4 modules are used. To avoid multi-reflections from each stub, other approaches have used coupled transmission lines (CTL) [3, 4]. While a horizontal directional coupler buried in the PCB was used [3], coupled traces on the bent loop of flex fixed to a module were used for signal delivery in vertical direction [4]. In [3], a long coupler with long main bus line was used so that the signal integrity degrades at the far-end coupler. In [4], the coupling traces on the motherboard and the flex have zigzag geometries for better misalignment tolerance, which result in large area of routing due to the minimum required pitch between traces. In [5], the CTL needs to be placed close to a Tx/Rx chip, as there are no extended transmission lines for signal lead. Therefore, it cannot be used for memory modules. DRAM multi-drop bus interface technology mapping is described in Fig. 2.8.1.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the 22nm Intel\u00ae processor codenamed Ivy Bridge that integrates up to four high-performance Intel Architecture (IA) cores, a power/performance optimized graphics/media processing unit (GPU), as well as memory, PCIe, and display controllers in the same die. The Ivy Bridge architecture is derived from the second-generation Intel Core\u2122 processor. The processor has about 1.4 billion transistors in about 160mm2 in its largest incarnation. It introduces several enhancements in power, performance, and features over its predecessor. The IA core adds a pipelined divider, a next page prefetcher, additions to the ISA for 16b floating point conversion, fast string moves, and fast access of the FS/GS base registers. The Graphics/Media block provides significantly improved performance along with DX11 API support. Further, display capabilities have been augmented with a third independent display pipeline. The on-die power management control unit (PCU) and its associated firmware have added several power and thermal optimizations to improve performance and yield within the existing platform power envelopes, as well as to improve idle power relative to its predecessor. Power gates are distributed throughout the cores, enabling the PCU to independently either reduce voltage to a state retention voltage, or turn off voltage to a given core, depending on the current core usage conditions. The processor also implements power gating for portions of the DDR I/O buffers, reducing CPU power consumption when memory is in \"self-refresh\" mode. To optimize core sleep time, Ivy Bridge incorporates smart interrupt routing logic, which sends interrupts to active cores. The PCU also analyzes the processor's inherent voltage-frequency dependency to determine the optimum operating voltages across the entire dynamic range of operation. The processor uses die temperature to estimate power and energy consumption in order to maximize performance.",

A rich multi-source IP eco-system consisting of standardized interfaces, modular and configurable building blocks, enables automation and fast execution to deliver a broad range of targeted solutions. Integrating high-performance digital circuits with analog and RF circuits on a leading edge process enables our SoC architecture to increase the level of integration, performance and reduce the cost of the platform. WiFi has remained an external PC component due to the challenges of managing system noise from the digital circuits. This paper presents an integrated standard x86 OS compliant, dual-core ATOM\u00ae processor-based SoC, including the RF WiFi to drive down platform cost. Key enabling features are: (a) a 32nm RF process with HV transistors and RF passives; (b) an on-chip interconnect fabric for modularity; (c) a clock generator with SSC to reduce substrate noise injection and EMI; (d) voltage regulators for power management and rail reduction; (e) an 802.11b/g RF WiFi transceiver with integrated LNA, PA, T/R switch and BIST/calibration engine.",

        "abstract": "Almost all multicore processors use a shared-memory architecture due to its simple programming model. Recently, however, the message-passing mechanism is also drawing attention due to its potentially better scalability. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid communication mechanism supporting both message passing and shared memory can provide both higher performance and energy efficiency. This 16-core processor has 3 key features: (1) A cluster-based hierarchical architecture supporting both shared-memory and message-passing communication. (2) A cache-free memory hierarchy with an extended register file, small private memory and moderate shared memory to avoid complex cache coherence issues and achieve high energy efficiency by keeping data accesses local. (3) A hardware-aided mailbox mechanism to accelerate the synchronization procedure between different processor nodes. With these techniques, our multicore processor can provide high performance for many applications. Chip test results show that its maximum clock frequency is 800MHz and typical power consumption is 320mW, when running basic applications with clock gating at 1.2V at room temperature.",

To support testability and robust operation at the wide range of operating frequencies required of a commercial processor, the clock system operates in two modes: direct-drive (cclk) and resonant (rclk). Leveraging favorable factors such as the availability of two thick top-level metals, high operating frequency, clock-load density, and the existing clock-design methodology, the rclk mode was designed to enable both reduced average power dissipation and improved peak-power-constrained performance, with minimal area impact. This work represents a volume production-enabled implementation of resonant clock technology, and is plan of record for mid-2012 product offerings.",

        "abstract": "Diverse spread spectrum clocking (SSC) generation requirements necessitate multiple reference clocks, extra pins, and off-chip components. With analog integer-n PLL-based clock generators, it is difficult to meet all these needs with a common reference clock. One disadvantage is that the frequency resolution in an integer-n PLL is limited by the reference frequency. A lower reference frequency limits the bandwidth and lock time, amplifies jitter from the reference, and increases the loop filter area. Additionally, analog PLLs suffer from unpredictable loop dynamics and clock skews with PVT, mismatch, and transistor leakage, further exacerbated by process scaling. Turning off and waking up an analog PLL requires charging or discharging loop filter capacitors which is inherently slow. This paper presents an all-digital clock generation architecture which (1) provides fractional-n capability in the digital domain; (2) implements SSC within the PLL loop; (3) performs digital clock deskew; and (4) provides dynamic loop bandwidth adjustment to shorten lock time.",

        "abstract": "As narrowband off-chip RF filtering is not compatible with the concept of software-defined radio (SDR), an SDR receiver must be designed to tolerate large out-of-band blockers with minimal gain compression and noise figure degradation. A recent circuit tackles this problem by dispensing with the LNA entirely. This mixer-first approach achieves impressive linearity, but at the expense of noise figure and, since such a receiver has no gain prior to down-conversion, the flicker noise corner can be unacceptably high. Other SDR attempts invariably use a noise-cancelling LNA at the front end, which provides wideband matching, however such approaches have either inadequate linearity or display too large a noise for our purposes. In this work, we propose a hybrid frequency-translational, noise-cancelling (FTNC) receiver that employs two separate down-conversion paths to enable noise cancelling with no voltage gain prior to base-band filtering. The resulting design has a sub-2dB noise figure and tolerates 0dBm blockers with no gain back-off, breaking the traditional noise-linearity trade-off common in all receivers.",

        "abstract": "The huge growth of the number of wireless devices makes wireless coexistence an increasingly relevant issue. If radios operate in close proximity, blockers as strong as 0dBm may occur, driving almost any receiver in compression (note that 0dBm in 50\u03a9 corresponds to a peak-to-peak voltage of half a 1.2V supply). Thus RF blocker filtering is highly wanted. However, fixed filters are undesired when aiming for multiband, software-defined or cognitive radio transceivers. Passive LC filters show limited Q and tunability. Recently frequency translated filtering has been proposed as a potential solution direction for high-Q filtering. We showed that by applying the \u201cN-path concept\u201d, more than a decade of center frequency range with good linearity, compression point (P1dB>;0dBm, IIP3 >;14dBm) and low noise is feasible for a bandpass (BP) filter. A notch filter with a combination of active and passive mixers is applied in a feedforward path realizing a BP filter. The low input impedance of a transimpedance amplifier with feedback is upconverted to create a notch filter at low frequencies (80MHz) suppressing TX leakage in an FDD system. In this work we explore the possibility to realize a notch filter applying the N-path concept at RF frequencies and in a completely passive way. A single-ended (SE) and a differential 8-path notch filter with passive frequency mixing are presented. The filters are power-matched in the input and output in the passband and provide a low insertion loss, high compression point and also low noise property, thus they can be utilized in front of a receiver to provide rejection of high-power blockers with a large frequency tuning range.",

Although a constant phase shift can approximate a time delay in a limited frequency band, this does not hold for larger arrays that scan over wide angles and have a large instantaneous bandwidth. In this case true time delays are wanted to avoid effects such as beam-squinting. In this paper we aim at compactly integrating a delay based phased-array receiver in standard CMOS IC technology. This is for instance relevant for synthetic aperture radars, which require large instantaneous bandwidths often in excess of 1GHz, either as RF or as IF bandwidth in a superheterodyne system. We target low-GHz radar frequencies, assuming sub-arrays of four elements and up to 550ps delay.",

        "abstract": "Integrating a CMOS RF power amplifier (PA) into a single-chip transceiver is one of the most challenging works in implementing radio front-ends, which presents many advantages in handheld applications. Especially, low-power efficiency enhancement (LPEE) techniques, considering the probability distribution function of the practical wireless communication environments, extend the battery lifetime in handheld devices. Therefore, there are many studies for the LPEE in handheld CMOS PAs using transmission-line transformers (TLTs) with parallel amplifiers. Designing a series/parallel-combining transformer (SCT/PCT) is one of the key factors in the implementation of a dual-mode CMOS PA. However, the dual-mode performances of the PA must be optimized by using one output TLT structure. It is expected that there are difficulties in designing a highly efficient dual-mode PA. Therefore, this paper introduces a fully integrated dual-mode CMOS PA with a proposed output TLT with 2 control switches, which allows an LPEE with a back-off region of 10dB or more with a very low quiescent current.",

        "abstract": "A low-cost, fully integrated CMOS PA is attractive. The main challenge is to improve its power efficiency. Although many linearization and efficiency improvement techniques have been proposed, most of these techniques are based on feed-forward, which may not be effective under varying PVT and load conditions [1-3]. The bandwidth is the issue for feedback techniques such as Cartesian and polar loop. There is a severe trade-off between output power and bandwidth, since generating high output power requires many gain stages including mixers and multiple drivers, which results in a large group delay. To overcome the trade-off, we propose a PA-closed loop, where an integrated feedback directly controls the final stage of a watt-level CMOS PA, as shown in Fig. 4.6.1. Although stable feedback at RF is difficult, separate phase and amplitude feedback can be realized without the stability issue. Large bandwidth and high output power are simultaneously realized, as the loop contains only the PA in the signal path and it is composed of a small number of building blocks. In addition, the proposed architecture is desirable for system integration, as the PA does not require an off-chip linearizer. The feedback improves ACLR with WCDMA output by 6dB, where the output power and PAE are +27.1dBm and 28%, respectively. Thanks to the feedback nature, it can improve the linearity and efficiency with varying load conditions, and is suitable for the increasing isolator-less applications. The linear output power and PAE are improved by up to 2.3dB and 6%, respectively, while the circuits for the loop consume 28.3mW.",

        "abstract": "The recent rapid spread of smart-phone use has resulted in a strong demand for a multi-band RF part with reduced size and power consumption. In the creation of an ideal RF system-on-a-chip, the biggest challenge is to realize a fully integrated PA in CMOS. In conventional PAs in compound semiconductor technologies, face-up wire-bond assembly with off-chip matching components is typically used, but flip-chip packaging is more suitable for slim mobile phones in which low-profile components are desired as well as for future integration with an RF transceiver in which the same packaging scheme is widely used. The PA for GSM [1] was insufficient for our target, so we needed to greatly improve the linearity in order to comply with the W-CDMA standard, which has better frequency-usage efficiency. Conventional CMOS PAs only support a single band [2,3] or are for WLAN [4] where the output power level is low (typically about 20dBm). In this paper, we present a fully-integrated triple-band linear CMOS PA for W-CDMA. Its flip-chip package is just 3.5\u00d74\u00d70.7mm3, and the average current consumption is less than 20mA.",

        "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for low-cost portable communication devices pushes for higher integration of wireless transceivers in deeply-scaled silicon technologies. Given the overwhelming digital content of a mobile platform, ideally, the RF components should be realized with topologies that allow for their seamless scaling into 22nm and 14nm CMOS technologies. The Power Amplifier (PA) remains one of the most challenging circuit blocks to implement in nanoscale CMOS due to the strict requirements for output power, efficiency and linearity imposed by wireless communication standards. The low breakdown voltage of nanoscale MOSFETs limits the maximum drain voltage swing and the maximum achievable output power. In order to circumvent this problem, a typical approach is to increase the device size and use a reactive matching network to transform the load resistance to a value significantly lower than 50\u03a9. Nevertheless, due to the typically low-Q passive components that can be manufactured in a nanoscale CMOS process, and because of the high impedance transformation ratio involved, most of the additional output power that would be gained by increasing the device size is wasted in resistive losses in the matching networks, resulting in poor efficiency. This problem is exacerbated at mm-Wave frequencies where the loss of the passive components is even higher, and using lower fT/fMAX thicker oxide or extended drain MOS devices [1] is not viable.",

The high efficiency of Class-D amplifiers makes them ideal for operation from boosted supplies. Moreover, in order to provide a better user experience in all multi-media applications, the new smart-phones and tablets are demanding for output peak power of higher than 2W on 8\u03a9 integrated speakers. In addition, new speakers can achieve better linearity and sensitivity leading to lower THD and noise specification for the amplifier.",

        "abstract": "A Class-D amplifier (CDA) is best suitable for audio mobile applications due to its high-power efficiency, thus enabling to remove a bulky heat sink. A traditional Class-D amplifier uses a 2-level output switching scheme. There typically exist an external LC filter and a bulky capacitor to block a DC average current and to protect the speaker from the current, which increases the bill of materials. As a remedy, a 3-level switching scheme allows to eliminate the filters, hence helping to reduce the system cost. Moreover, the 3-level switching scheme provides additional benefits of less electromagnetic interference and better power efficiency. The 3-level approach prevails with the help of various modulation techniques such as a pulse-width modulation (PWM) [1,2], a sliding-mode control [3], and a uniform PWM [4] method.",

In an effort to drive PV energy towards grid parity, there is a need to improve the power electronics and architecture for grid-connected systems. Traditional PV systems use a central inverter to manage multiple strings of series-connected PV modules. With mismatch among the PV cells, the energy production of the array suffers in several ways: 1) in series strings, current is limited to the lowest-performing cell in the string, 2) if current is forced to exceed this level, external bypass diodes need to turn on throwing away power available in the string and incurring conductive losses, 3) with bypass diodes on, total string voltage may deviate from maximum power voltage (Vmpp), reducing energy production of all modules in the string.",

Due to the roof's curvature the solar cells (SC) show different inclination angles to the sunlight, resulting in different maximum power points (MPP) and a lower harvested energy if all SCs are controlled by a centralized MPP-regulated DC/DC converter. A further issue is partial shading. The use of smart modules where a smaller SC number is tied to a module-integrated converter with MPP tracking (MPPT) improves the system efficiency. Current smart module controllers like the SPV1020 [5] use ADCs for voltage and current measurements together with digital processing. Quasi-analog MPPT methods for system-on-chip implementation in this field of application are discussed and tested [1,2] but not realized as ICs. In the field of energy harvesting for micro power applications converters with integrated analogue MPPT are already implemented [3] but the quality of the MPP regulation is too poor for the use in smart modules.",

The first problem is the self-startup capability. Because many wireless sensor nodes are likely to be located where human-maintenance is difficult, starting them up manually can be as difficult as replacing the battery. Its realization has been difficult because \u03bcEHs must be able to turn itself on without any stored energy. Some previous works have reported such a function: some needed high voltage [1] or vibration [2] and one used a transformer as a starter [3]. The other problem is the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) capability. Because it is known that MPPT algorithms usually require considerable power consumption [4], using them in \u03bcEHs is impractical. This paper suggests a new boost converter architecture and MPPT control method which can bring \u03bcEH into practical use.",

In this paper, an ultra low quiescent current charger and battery management IC that can efficiently extract energy from solar panels and thermoelectric generators to charge batteries and super capacitors is presented. While previous works on energy harvesting [1-5] report efficient DC-DC converters to extract the energy from the harvester, not all of them provide complete battery management functionality for various chemistries. Also, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) which is critical in energy harvesting applications is not provided in some of the published work. In this paper, a charger and battery management IC with 330nA quiescent current is presented. The IC can cold start from 330mV and 5\u03bcW of input power. The charger achieves efficiency greater than 80% at single cell solar voltages of 0.5V. A low quiescent current battery management architecture involving sampled circuits, sub regulated rails and clock gating is demonstrated.",

The direct-type photon-counting method has higher X-ray-to-charge conversion efficiency and position resolution compared with the indirect-type detection method. Therefore, direct-type detection is more suitable for medical imaging applications for which the dose efficiency and the image quality are especially important.",

        "abstract": "For outdoor surveillance, sensitivity and dynamic range are important to deliver reliable images over widely changing illumination. However, constant monitoring with maximum awareness requires large power consumption and is not suitable for energy-limited applications such as battery-operated and/or energy-scavenging wireless sensor nodes. One of the ways to reduce power is voltage scaling [1-4]. However, it significantly reduces the SNR and results in poor image quality [4]. The signal can be easily corrupted from the noise in dark conditions or be saturated in bright conditions. Most imagers with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range [5,6] consume large power >;50mW, unsuitable for wireless imager node applications. Therefore, it is imperative to implement a sensor adaptable to environmental changes: i.e., the sensor keeps monitoring at extremely low power operation and only turns into high-sensitivity or wide-dynamic-range operations when requested due to illumination changes or requested from the host for detailed image transmission. The sensor changes its operation back to the monitoring mode as a default or when enough operating energy is not available from the battery or energy-harvester. In this paper, we report an adaptive CMOS image sensor that employs four different modes: monitoring, normal, high-sensitivity and wide-dynamic-range (WDR) modes. This adaptable feature enables reliable monitoring while significantly enhancing battery lifetime for wireless image-sensor nodes.",

An important role of the air gap is to decrease capacitive coupling of display noise to the sensors, and it is very effective since permittivity of air is more than 4\u03c7 lower than that of glass.",

These systems have very strict requirements in terms of power dissipation, high signal quality, small area (minimal use of externals) and robust operation during ambulatory use. The latter is emerging as an especially important problem since in real-life ambulatory conditions, motion artifacts can disturb and potentially saturate the readout channel. In addition, requirements for multimodal information acquisition require even more functionality with minimal power dissipation.",

        "abstract": "Silicon devices based on impedance measurements offer label-free and direct electrical detection when used to quantify the hybridization of DNA molecules. They show rapid, robust, and inexpensive measurement and compatibility with commercial microfabrication technology. The real-time measurement of the impedance does not require the use of labeling molecules attached to the target DNA in optical and magnetic technology [1,2]. It also has the advantage of miniaturization for point-of-care (PoC) or on-site sensing applications, unlike the 3-electrode topology in electrochemical sensors [3]. Several studies have proposed capacitive biosensors that utilize a nonfaradaic process, which refers to transient currents charging a geometrical capacitor in an electrolyte-electrode interface [4]. Conventional capacitive biosensors using the excitation of the bidirectional current [5,6] can be implemented with a compact design, but they have several issues that degrade the sensitivity of the sensor, such as DC drift in the electrode caused by a charge imbalance, the electrolysis generated by DC voltage across the electrodes, the offset generated by pre-charged initial values, and weakness against common-mode noise. As a solution, we report a fully integrated capacitance-based biosensor that locates two electrodes differentially in a single current source.",

        "abstract": "Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is a technique whereby low-light signals are recorded with picosecond timing resolution relative to a synchronized optical impulse excitation, in order to extract the characteristic fluorescence decay constant, or lifetime [1]. Typical TCSPC apparatus includes a pulsed optical source, a discrete detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT), external time-to-digital conversion (TDC) hardware and a PC to compute the decay constant, resulting in a bulky, expensive and power-hungry acquisition system. A major limitation of this approach is the restrictively low photon count limit of 1-to-5% of the excitation rate, which is necessary in order to avoid distortion due to photon `pile-up' caused by both long detector dead-time and the inability of the TDC hardware to process more than one event per excitation period. As such, promising applications of TCSPC including cell cytometry, confocal microscopy, high throughput screening (HTS), and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are severely limited by peak acquisition rates of 1MHz. Although 100MHz has been achieved [2], the approach used is restricted to fluorescent dyes with lifetimes less than 2ns. Recent advances in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) and on-chip TDCs manufactured in standard CMOS processes have enabled TCSPC measurements to be performed by an imaging array [3]; however such devices produce data at over 25Gb/s, have low fill factors of ~2% and pixel update rates are limited. Time-gated lifetime sensing significantly reduces the data bandwidth and processing time [4,5], but is photon inefficient and still limited by pile-up.",

        "abstract": "The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new minimally invasive, unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable tongue-operated assistive technology (AT) that enables individuals with severe physical disabilities to control environments with their free tongue motion. An array of magnetic sensors wirelessly tracks the position of a magnetic tracer attached to the tongue via adhesives or piercing, and a sensor signal-processing (SSP) algorithm converts a set of tongue gestures to user-defined commands in real time [1]. In the external TDS (eTDS), which is undergoing clinical trials, electronics are embedded in a customized headset, which supports the sensors on a pair of bilateral extensions near the cheeks [2]. Considering the importance of such ATs in users' daily lives, the mechanical stability of the eTDS on the head is a concern. In this paper we report an intraoral TDS (iTDS) that reliably fits inside a user's mouth in the form of a dental retainer to be well protected within the oral cavity.",

        "abstract": "The specific detection of anti-bodies or proteins in a point-of-care setting remains an unsolved technological challenge. While laboratory instruments rely on enzymatic labels and require complex, difficult-to-miniaturize optics, devices using super-paramagnetic labels have emerged as an attractive alternative for point-of-care systems [1]. The key challenge for all magnetic-bead detection systems [2-5] is the presence of a large measurement \u201cbaseline.\u201d Since beads are paramagnetic, a polarization field must be applied in order to excite a magnetic response. This response is ~1000\u00d7 smaller than the polarization field, necessitating a combination of calibration, reference sensors [2], and temperature stabilization [5] to reject the polarization field. In addition to a low and stable baseline, a practical system should have low measurement time and large sensing area to reduce biological variations [6].",

        "abstract": "Using optics for chip-to-chip interconnects has recently gained a lot of interest. As data rates scale to meet increasing bandwidth requirements, the shortcomings of copper channels are becoming more severe. Hybrid integration of optical devices with electronics has been demonstrated to achieve high performance, and recent advances in silicon photonics have led to fully integrated optical signaling. These approaches pave the way to massively parallel optical communications. Dense arrays of optical detectors require very low-power, sensitive, and compact optical receiver circuits. Existing designs for the input receiver, such as TIA, require large power consumption to achieve high band width and low noise, and can occupy large area due to bandwidth-enhancement inductors. In this work, a compact low-power optical receiver that scales well with technology is designed to explore the potential of optical signaling for future chip-to-chip and on-chip communication.",

        "abstract": "The growing demand for low-power and high-fidelity chip-to-chip data communication has motivated the use of near-ground or low-common-mode voltage (LCM) signaling [1-2]. However, deployment of such signaling for high-speed applications such as graphics memory interfaces has been hampered by complications of the transmitter and receiver designs. Recent techniques have enhanced the performance of source-series terminated transmitters by accommodating impedance and equalization calibration at a low power cost [3]. This work advances LCM receiver high-frequency operation by introducing an accurate termination calibration, taking into account the receiver loading on the data link channel. Our receiver also incorporates common-mode-to-differential-gain cancellation and in-situ equalization calibration for reliable data reception at 16Gb/s over a 3\u201d FR4 PCB memory link with 15dB loss at Nyquist frequency.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the limited bandwidth of chip-to-chip and backplane communication channels at multi-Gb/s data-rates, high-speed I/O transceivers employ a combination of DFE in the RX and FFE in the TX, since these equalizers complement each other to provide an effective equalization solution. Using RX-side FFE instead of TX-side FFE can bring important advantages to the transceiver: it obviates any back-channel for coefficient adaptation and improves RX interoperability with different TXs. RX-FFE is also preferable to simple peaking amplifiers, since it enables greater flexibility in setting the pre-cursor and post-cursor coefficients. However, traditional RX-FFEs with analog delay lines are not area efficient and do not support a wide range of data-rates. This paper describes design techniques that enable the realization of a RX with 4-tap FFE and 5-tap DFE, having area and power efficiency comparable to DFE-only RXs.",

        "abstract": "In high-speed wireline communication, full-rate clocking for chip-to-chip interface has been widely adopted since it eliminates clock-induced deterministic jitter. Design with standard digital CMOS technologies, however, often limits the maximum frequency of circuit operation. The increase in power and circuit complexity in full-rate clocking makes the problem even worse in the design of a parallel transceiver whose clock tree travels through long interconnects. As an alternative to the full-rate clocking, frequency generation with a multiphase PLL has been also considered to relax the tight requirements of operating frequency of oscillator and flip-flops. DRAM interface, as a representative of high-speed parallel links, has adopted quadruple data rate (QDR) schemes for high-speed graphic applications [1-2]. However, as the data rate of DRAM interface increases up to multi-Gb/s range, skew in quadrature clock phases presents one of the most serious performance degradation factors.",

CD preserves the desirable properties of differential signaling while offering ISI mitigation that is superior to 1-tap decision feedback equalization (DFE) [1-2] at no loss in pin efficiency or throughput. Specifically, CD encodes two bits of data over four binary wires in such a way that post-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) is completely eliminated across the entire unit-interval (UI). CD signaling is NRZ on individual wires and is balanced across the bus, meaning over any UI half the four-wire set have a high signaling level while the other half have a low level. The balanced nature of signaling leads to low supply switching noise. Received data is detected differentially by discriminating the difference between the signals on wire pairs without the need for a fixed reference voltage.",

        "abstract": "In high-speed communication with a data rate of multi-Gb/s, the crosstalk noise induced by electromagnetic coupling is becoming a significant noise source, requiring careful considerations in the design of transceiver circuits as well as physical dimension of the transmission lines. When an input voltage of Vi is applied to one of two parallel transmission lines, the induced voltages at the victim line by near-end crosstalk (NEXT) and far-end crosstalk (FEXT) can be expressed as VNEXT(t)=1/4[Cm/CS+Lm/LS]\u00b7{Vi(t)-Vi(t-2tf)}, VNEXT(t)=tf/2[Cm/CS-Lm/LS]\u00b7dVi(t-tf)/dt (1) where tf, Cm, CS, Lm and LS represent the time-of-flight, the mutual, self-capacitances, mutual, and self-inductances of the transmission line per unit length, respectively. Though NEXT has more energy due the inductive coupling added to the capacitive coupling, the wide distribution in time over 2tf results in a small peak noise and is a concern only in high-speed low-voltage differential signaling. However, FEXT in parallel microstrip lines causes a significant peak noise due to smaller capacitive coupling by inhomogeneous structure with the upper side exposed to air. The effect of FEXT turns out to be non-zero signal delay at the receiver side, presenting a serious performance-limiting factor in single-ended high-density parallel links such as memory interface.",

With potentially thousands of multi-Gb/s I/O, sup port for tens of Tb/s data bandwidth between local chips can be enabled by 3D integration technology, but this ultra-high bandwidth will only be achieved if area and power efficiency challenges for 3D I/O are met. Because 3D interconnect offers reduced loading and hence improved signal integrity as compared to tra ditional inter-chip channels, 3D cross-chip I/O does not require complex, power hungry equalization schemes. Reduced swing approaches offer a path to further power reduction for 3D I/O, but the receivers for low-swing schemes are typically complex and consume large area and power. This paper addresses this problem, presenting a compact, low-power 3D cross-chip I/O composed of a low-swing Tx and a gated-diode sense-amplifier-based Rx.",

Our target application is a low-power IEEE 802.11n receiver for 2.4 to 2.5GHz using a fixed 3.2GHz clock and IF tuned from 700 to 800MHz. The fixed clock allows an integer-N PLL with high reference frequency (40MHz, for example), which allows wide loop bandwidth and low phase noise, even at mW-level power consumption (e.g. [1]). The power savings from simplified LO generation are also important. Sampling from IF with an fs/4 modulator rather than sampling from RF with a 3fs/4 modulator (as in [2]) gives higher ADC SNR because Q-enhanced LC filters have a tradeoff between Q and SNR and the loop filter fractional bandwidth is greater at the lower center frequency.",

However, conventional CTBPDSMs suffer from large power consumption and occupy large area. CTBPDSMs based on LC tanks are large, while biquad-based resonators are also large and suffer from high power consumption because two amplifiers are usually required in each resonator. The fact that there are typically twice as many feedback paths compared to a lowpass \u0394\u03a3 modulator with the same bandwidth and performance also increases power consumption, area and complexity. This paper presents a power-efficient resonator with a single amplifier and also introduces a simplified architecture utilizing return-to-zero (RZ) and half-clock-delayed return-to-zero (HZ) pulses to solve the power and complexity problems.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital conversion presents an attractive means of implementing high-bandwidth oversampling ADCs [1,2]. They exhibit inherent noise-shaping properties and can operate at low supply voltages and high sampling rates [1-3]. However, usage of VCO-based ADCs has been limited due to their nonlinear voltage-to-frequency (V-to-F) transfer characteristic, which severely degrades their distortion performance. Digital calibration is used to combat nonlinearity in an open-loop VCO-based ADC, but 1st-order noise-shaping mandates high OSRs, thus increasing power dissipation in digital circuits, even in a nanometer-scale CMOS process [1]. In [2], nonlinearity is suppressed by embedding the VCO in a \u0394\u03a3 loop. While this technique works in principle, the need for large loop gain at high frequencies makes it very difficult to achieve high SNDR. For instance, the suppression level near the band edge is approximately 20dB for a VCO-based 2nd-order modulator operating with an over-sampling ratio (OSR) of 30. Our ADC overcomes the impact of VCO non-linearity by minimizing the input signal processed by the VCO. The prototype achieves 78.3dB SNDR in a 10MHz signal bandwidth at 600MHz sampling rate, while consuming 16mW power.",

        "abstract": "To address a worldwide market, silicon tuners have to support a wide range of frequencies and standards, motivating the use of architectures inspired by the software-defined-radio paradigm. DVB-T, DVB-C, ATSC-A/74 as well as cable modems (DOCSIS) and analog TV require low-noise, high-linearity front-ends with high-performance local oscillators. Integrability and cost dictate minimization of external components. Unlike common approaches the silicon tuner presented in this paper features one single-ended RF input for the entire 40MHz-to-1GHz band, requires no external SAW filters or balun, and supports channel bandwidths from 5 to 8MHz. The analog IF output is programmable from 5MHz to 44MHz, supporting both modern digital demodulators and legacy analog demodulators. The receiver uses a low-IF architecture and is able to process the broadband input spectrum through the combination of a low-noise programmable RF filter, a digitally calibrated harmonic-rejection mixer, and a wide dynamic range ADC, whose intrinsic filtering nature and large SNDR make the tuner compatible with the very demanding ATSC A/74 standard. The chip's sophisticated digital back-end provides channel filtering and image rejection for the signal path, runs the RF and IF AGCs, and controls a variety of calibration schemes used to improve performance and robustness toward PVT variations. The chip has been designed in a scaled 90nm CMOS technology, requires a 1.8V analog supply and a 1.0V digital supply, and dissipates <;450mW during normal operation and <;10mW in standby mode. The BoM is limited to a single LNA bias inductor and a 40MHz crystal, thus minimizing the required footprint and cost.",

        "abstract": "Fourth-generation mobile devices use wide channel bandwidths and OFDM modulation to achieve high data rates. In particular, OFDM modulation in LTE20 creates up to 100 Resource Blocks (RB) each containing 12 subcarriers with 15kHz spacing, spread over the channel bandwidth. For an RB with frequency offset fs from the LO, transmitter non-linearity causes counter-intermodulation (CIM) products at -3fs, +5fs, -7fs, ... from the LO. These spurious signals directly, or through remixing due to PA non-linearity, may fall on other bands. The worst case is when one or just a few RBs are transmitted at the edge of the channel. The CIM effect, specific to 4G signals, makes the design of multimode transmitters more challenging since such transmitters also need to meet the substantially different 2G and 3G requirements. Previous works on LTE have mainly focused on the stringent RX-band noise and ACLR requirements for SAW-less transmitter design without discussing the CIM performance [1]. CIM terms are first generated by mixers. A drive amplifier (DA) placed after the mixers will cause these terms to be regenerated due to high-level harmonic sidebands. DA noise contribution can also be significant, especially at low output power. If current-mode mixers are employed, the use of a differential DA may be prohibitive due to large power consumption [2]. A transmitter without DA avoids these problems while it helps reduce die area and power consumption. This paper describes a multi-mode multiband DA-less transmitter which meets the counter-intermodulation and RX-band noise requirements for SAW-less operation for 2G, 3G and 4G standards while avoiding excessive power consumption, as reported in [3,4].",

        "abstract": "The impedance transformation property of passive mixers enables integrated high-Q channel selection at RF with a programmable center frequency through a clock [1,2]. As such, this technique is suitable for addressing both linearity and flexibility requirements in wideband and cognitive radio applications. However, given the typically low resistance level at the RF side of the receiver chain, the RC product necessary for filtering results in large capacitors, and, consequently, large die area that does not scale with technology. In addition, filter rejection at the RF side is limited by the resistance of the switches of the passive mixer. Thus, large switches are typically needed for moderate rejection values (5\u03a9 switches for 16dB rejection [2]), which translates to higher power consumption in the LO buffers. Furthermore, filtering prior to the LNA [1] or eliminating it altogether [3] improves linearity at the expense of noise and switching harmonics being injected directly at the antenna node. Conversely, an LNA first architecture offers an opposite trade-off. This work demonstrates a highly compact design of a direct-conversion receiver with an active feedback frequency translation loop to perform channel selection at the LNA output while simultaneously cancelling its distortion.",

        "abstract": "Integration of radios in SoCs along with digital baseband and application processors is desirable for cost and form-factor reasons. Digital processors are typically implemented in the latest CMOS process to take advantage of the increased density and performance afforded by CMOS scaling. Integration of traditional RF circuits, however, requires accurate RF and passive models that typically lag behind digital transistor models by several quarters. This makes RF integration the limiting factor for time-to-market for the whole SoC, or results in sub-optimal multiple-chip solutions. Furthermore, traditional RF circuits do not benefit from scaling as digital circuits do, e.g. due to extensive use of inductors, the ever-lowering supply voltage, etc. This work presents a digital WiFi transmitter (TX) implemented in a 32nm digital CMOS process to address these issues. An outphasing architecture allows implementation of both amplitude and phase modulation using scaling-friendly, delay-based, switching phase modulators. The integrated PA was already shown to be possible to design with no RF models [1]; known issues of outphasing PA design (e.g. output impedance modulation, linearity, efficiency) are also addressed in [1]. The phase modulator uses an open-loop architecture to accommodate OFDM bandwidths up to 40MHz. The TX achieves state-of-the-art performance already in 32nm and is moreover expected to: (1) improve with scaling and (2) port easily over successive process nodes.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing popularity of mobile devices, such as smart- phones and tablets, is driving the demand for integrating multiple radios on a single SoC to reduce cost, form factor and external BOM. These devices require ubiquitous wireless connectivity, which means concurrent operation with different radios. While concurrent operation of multiple radios brings excellent user experiences, there exist great challenges in dealing with radio co-existence in an SoC. For example, concurrent operation between WiFi and BT, both oper- ating in the 2.4GHz ISM band, sets additional requirements in RF front-end cir- cuits and system control. In addition, thermal effect of the integrated WiFi PA needs to be compensated to minimize its impact on the frequency-precise GPS system.",

        "abstract": "Phased arrays in CMOS for consumer communication bands aim to enhance receiver performance by exploiting beamforming with antenna arrays. Sensitivity increases with the number of antenna elements through array gain and interferers can be cancelled through the spatial filtering of the beam pattern [1]. For the latter, the linearity of the receiver before the beamforming summing point becomes a bottleneck as interferers are not cancelled yet. Phase shifting in the LO domain reduces the complexity in the signal path and enables the use of linear signal blocks, but has high requirements on the multiphase LO generation [2]. On the other hand, a switched-capacitor phase shifter can be very linear, but is limited by the linearity of the necessary input matching and element summing gm-stages [3]. This paper proposes a fully passive phased-array receiver front-end which implements impedance matching, phase shifting and element summing with only switched-capacitor stages for a high linearity.",

A wide SIMD vector permutation engine is required to achieve high-throughput data rearrangement operations on large data sets, with scaled supply voltages to deliver high energy efficiency. An ultra-low-voltage reconfigurable 4-way to 32-way SIMD vector permutation engine consisting of a 32-entry \u00d7 256b 3-read/1-write ported register file with a 256b byte-wise any-to-any permute crossbar for 2-dimensional shuffle is fabricated in 22nm CMOS. The register file integrates a vertical shuffle across multiple entries into read/write operations, and includes clockless static reads with shared P/N dual-ended transmission gate (DETG) writes, improving register file VMIN by 250mV across PVT variations with a wide dynamic operating range of 280mV-1.1V. The permute crossbar implements an interleaved folded byte-wise multiplexer layout forming an any-to-any fully-connected tree to perform a horizontal shuffle with permute accumulate circuits, and includes vector flip-flops, stacked min-delay buffers, shared gates to average min-sized transistor variation, and ultra-low-voltage split-output (ULVS) level shifters improving logic VMIN by 150mV, while enabling peak energy efficiency of 585GOPS/W measured at 260mV, 50\u00b0C. The permutation engine occupies a dense layout of 0.048mm2 (Fig. 10.1.7) while achieving: (i) nominal register file performance of 1.8GHz, 106mW measured at 0.9V, 50\u00b0C; (ii) robust register file functionality measured down to 280mV (subthreshold) with peak energy efficiency of 154GOPS/W; (iii) scalable permute crossbar performance of 2.9GHz, 69mW measured at 1.1V, 50\u00b0C with deep sub-threshold operation at 240mV, 10MHz consuming 19\u03bcW; and (iv) a 64b 4\u00d74 matrix transpose algorithm with 53% energy sav- ngs and 42% improved peak throughput of 263Gbps measured at 1.8GHz, 0.9V.",

        "abstract": "While continued scaling of feature sizes allows for an ever increasing number of cores in modern MPSoCs, power reduction and meeting on-chip bandwidth requirements are pressing concerns. Energy efficiency can be increased by per-core dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and by employing a globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS) system architecture in which distribution of a synchronous high-speed clock is not required. For global on-chip communication this presents major challenges due to the need for reliable data synchronization, high bandwidth requirements and speed limiting RC effects on long wires. It has been shown recently that low-swing differential on-chip links provide highest bandwidth, low energy-per-bit and uninterrupted transfers over lengths up to 10mm [1-3, 6]. Capacitively-driven links are promising because of their built-in pre-emphasis thereby countervailing the low-pass behavior of long on-chip wires [1, 4-5]. However, all of these existing implementations focus mainly on the transmission line itself. The capacitively-driven links are not able to forward a stoppable clock signal as there is no well defined differential DC level on the wires with no data or clock activity. In addition, clocking is not reported [5] or fully synchronous, which means a high-speed clock must be distributed globally on-chip. This work provides a solution for capacitively-driven links with a parallel DC resistive divider to allow forwarded clocking with complete gating capability.",

Higher floating-point precisions offer improved accuracy at the expense of performance and energy efficiency, with variable-precision floating-point circuits providing run-time precision selection [3]. Real-time certainty tracking enables variable-precision circuits not only to operate at the higher energy efficiency of low-precision datapaths, but also to preserve high-precision accuracy. A variable-precision floating-point unit that performs fused multiply-adds (FMA) with single-cycle throughput while supporting operation in either 1-way single-precision (24b mantissa), 2-way 12b precision or 4-way 6b precision modes is fabricated in 32nm High-k/Metal-gate CMOS [4]. Simultaneous floating-point certainty tracking, preshifted addends, a combined rounding and negation incrementer, efficient reuse of mantissa datapath for multiple parallel lower precision calculations, robust ultra-low voltage circuits, and fine-grained clock gating enable nominal energy efficiency of 52GFLOPS/W (IEEE 32b single-precision, measured at 1.45GHz, 1.05V, 25\u00b0C) with a dense layout occupying 0.045mm2 (Fig. 10.3.7) while achieving: (i) scalable performance up to 3.6GFLOPS (single-precision), 96mW measured at 1.2V; (ii) up to 4\u00d7 higher throughput of 14.4GFLOPS with variable-precision, while maintaining single-precision accuracy; (iii) fast single-cycle precision reconfigurability; (iv) precision mode-dependent power consumption for up to 40% clock power reduction; (v) near-threshold single-precision operation measured at 300mV, 1.75MHz, 11\u03bcW; and, (vi) peak energy efficiency of 321GFLOPS/W (single-precision) and 1.2TFLOPS/W (6b precision) at 325mV, 25\u00b0C.",

This paper proposes the use of near-threshold computing (NTC) to address this issue in a stacked 3D system. In NTC, cores are operated near the threshold voltage (~200mV above Vth) to optimally balance power and performance [1]. In Centip3De, we operate cores at 650mV, as opposed to the wear-out limited supply voltage of 1.5V. This improves measured energy efficiency by 5.1\u00d7. The dramatically lower power consumption of NTC makes it an attractive match for 3D design, which has limited power dissipation capabilities, but also has improved innate power and performance compared to 2D design.",

        "abstract": "Precision accelerometers are used in a variety of automotive applications, navigation systems, and low-level vibration-monitoring systems. Currently, these sensors are factory-calibrated to null their input offset. However, the residual offset drifts mainly due to thermal and mechanical stress and humidity. As a result, the offset accuracy of high-end MEMS accelerometers is specified on the order of \u00b1100mg. With continuously increasing precision requirements, it is desirable to develop new techniques that address post-calibration drift. In this paper, we describe an accelerometer interface that continuously measures and cancels offset drift due to change in parasitic capacitance of the bondwires in a system-in-package-type MEMS accelerometer. The proposed technique reduces the bondwire offset of the measured prototypes by 41dB down to 6.24mg.",

        "abstract": "In precision mechatronic systems, such as wafer steppers, the position of critical mechanical components must be dynamically stabilized with sub-nanometer precision. This can be achieved by a servo loop consisting of a displacement sensor and an actuator. Compared to optical interferometers, capacitive displacement sensors offer smaller size and lower cost. However, mechanical tolerances limit their electrode spacing to about 10\u03bcm [1], while the targeted resolution is below 100pmrms. This requires a capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) with more than 17b resolution. Furthermore, its latency must be low enough (20\u03bcs) to avoid compromising servo-loop stability. Lastly, it should be stable enough to maintain measurement accuracy during the intervals between system calibrations.",

A practical charge source implementation (Fig. 11.3.1) is a DC-DC converter (Vd) with a very high series resistance in the form of bipolar diodes (D1, 2) [1]. A capacitor (Cg) provides the signal ground for the microphone (Cmems). An ADC performs continuous-time voltage readout of the microphone signal pin. Preferably its DC bias is equal to the ADC common-mode voltage. This paper deals with a biasing feedback loop (BFL) that realizes this function.",

Together with other leakage currents, this leads to rapidly increasing temperature errors at high temperatures: up to \u00b13.0\u00b0C at 200\u00b0C [1].",

There are fairly large thermal gradients across the core, which vary for different instructions, so it is necessary to position thermal sensors near hot-spots. In addition, the locations of the hot-spots may not be predictable during the design phase. Thus it is necessary for hot-spot sensors to be small enough to be moved late in the design cycle or even after first Silicon.",

MIMO detection and FEC belong to the most computationally complex parts of the receiver-side baseband signal processing chain. Implementations thereof must have low power consumption, but also be able to interact in a flexible and efficient way in the detection-decoding engine, while at the same time not compromising on the challenging throughput and flexibility requirements associated with 4G standards. In this paper, we present a chip implementation of a MIMO sphere detector combined with a flexible FEC engine, realizing a detection-decoding engine in silicon capable of satisfying 4G requirements with a data rate of 335Mb/s.",

        "abstract": "Moving object recognition in a video stream is crucial for applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile augmented reality that require robust and fast recognition in the presence of dynamic camera noise. Devices in such applications suffer from severe motion/camera blur noise in low-light conditions due to low-sensitivity CMOS image sensors, and therefore require higher computing power to obtain robust results vs. devices used in still image applications. Moreover, HD resolution has become so universal today that even smartphones support applications with HD resolution. However, many object recognition processors and accelerators reported for mobile applications only support SD resolution due to the computational complexity of object recognition algorithms. This paper presents a moving-target recognition processor for HD video streams. The processor is based on a context-aware visual attention model (CAVAM).",

        "abstract": "The use of image recognition technologies is becoming more popular recently in a variety of industries such as automotive, surveillance, and others. SoCs for such image recognition applications are required to be powerful enough to support real-time multiple object recognition, with power consumption not exceeding a few Watts. Adaptability to a range of applications is also desirable. In this context, massively parallel processors and heterogeneous many-core processors with 200GOPS have been proposed. However, rising demands for simultaneous execution of multiple applications leads to even higher performance requirements. In advanced driver-assistance systems for automotive, for example, forward collision warning and traffic sign recognition should execute simultaneously to improve safety of the system. In addition, the accuracy of recognition is also important. With its high accuracy (96% detection rate/0.1% false-positive rate), object recognition using co-occurrence histograms of oriented gradients (CoHOG) is a promising algorithm. However, the algorithm requires an extensive amount of computation. For example, a desktop computer with a 3GHz quad-core processor is needed for CoHOG-based pedestrian detection in a backover prevention (BOP) application. Considering these requirements, we have developed an image recognition SoC with the following features: 1) a multi-core processor to provide adaptability to various applications; 2) accelerators for image processing tasks and image recognition tasks to realize high performance at low power consumption; and, 3) a hardware accelerator for a CoHOG based real-time recognition.",

In addition, advanced 3DTV specifications involving a large number of camera views are targeted by emerging applications such as free-viewpoint TV (FTV). This paper presents a single-chip design that supports real-time H.264 decoding of SHV or up to 32 HD views. The design of the chip involved 3 key challenges: 1) Data dependencies of video coding algorithms restrict the degree of hardware parallelism. For SHV, each macroblock (MB) should be processed in less than 40 cycles at 300MHz, which is difficult to meet with a single pipeline; 2) due to the massive design and verification effort for video decoders, a scalable architecture that allows the maximum reuse of existing IP is desirable; and 3) the DRAM bandwidth requirements are always a bottleneck in high-throughput video decoders.",

        "abstract": "Future product applications demand increasing performance with reduced power consumption, which motivates the pursuit of high-performance at reduced operating voltages. Random and systematic device variations pose significant challenges to SRAM VMIN and low-voltage performance as technology scaling follows Moore's law to the 22nm node. A high-performance, voltage-scalable 162Mb SRAM array is developed in a 22nm tri-gate bulk technology featuring 3rd-generation high-k metal-gate transistors and 5th-generation strained silicon. Tri-gate technology reduces short-channel effects (SCE) and improves subthreshold slope to provide 37% improved device performance at 0.7V. Continuous device width sizing in planar technology is replaced by combining parallel silicon fins to multiply drive current. Process-circuit co-optimization of transient voltage collapse write assist (TVC-WA) and wordline underdrive read assist (WLUD-RA) features address process variation and fin quantization at 22nm and enable a 175mV reduction in the supply voltage required for 2GHz SRAM operation. Figure 13.1.1 shows an SEM top-down view of a 0.092\u03bcm2 high-density 6T SRAM bitcell (HDC) and a 0.108\u03bcm2 low-voltage 6T SRAM cell (LVC) after gate and diffusion processing. Computational OPC/RET techniques extend the capabilities of 193nm immersion lithography to allow a 1.85\u00d7 increase in array density relative to 32nm designs [1].",

It is particularly severe for half-select disturb because both write and read occur at the same row. While a wordline (WL) voltage assist technique [1] does not improve half-select disturbs, a negative bitline (BL) scheme [2] or asymmetric pass gate (PG) transistor with higher VTH during read [3] can be effective for mitigating half-select disturbs. While these techniques can increase operating margins, they cannot specifically target cells to correct for random variations.",

        "abstract": "High-performance microprocessors and SoCs include multiple embedded memory arrays used as register files and low-level caches that typically share the same supply voltage as the core. The desire for wide voltage range operation to optimize power and performance dictates the need for SRAM arrays that can achieve both high performance and low minimum voltage of operation (VMIN). The 8T bitcell is commonly used in these applications because its decoupled read and write ports offer fast read (RD) and write (WR) operations with generally lower VMIN than the 6T bitcell. However, process variations result in mismatches between the pull-up and access devices limiting write VMIN, and/or between read port and keeper transistors limiting read VMIN. Traditional device up-sizing provides diminishing returns at a large area and power cost. In addition to cell upsizing, dynamic assist techniques have been used for VMIN reduction in 6T and 8T arrays - examples include temporary collapse of bitcell voltage for write VMIN reduction and boosting read and write wordlines requiring careful design of the embedded charge pump and the level shifters. In contrast, this paper describes a new capacitive-coupling (CC) write wordline boost which employs intrinsic coupling capacitance between write bitlines (WBL) and accessed write wordline (WWL) to boost WWL without the need for a charge pump or complex level shifters. The scheme has a built-in self-induced VCC collapse (SIC) allowing the cell voltage to partially collapse during the write operation, further improving write VMIN. The technique is implemented in a 12KB, 8T cell macro with cell area of 0.238\u03bcm2, fabricated in a 22nm CMOS technology.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the market for mobile information terminals such as smart phones and tablets, the performance of image processing engines (e.g., operation speed, accuracy in digital images) has improved remarkably. In these processors, 2-port SRAM (2P-SRAM) macros, in which a read port and a write port are operated synchronously in a single clock cycle, are widely used. Since the 2P-SRAM is placed in front of large scale logic circuitry for image processing, a faster access time (e.g., <;1 ns) is required. In general, the read-out operation in 2P-SRAM utilizes full-swing of the single read bitline (BL), so a drastic improvement of the access time is not expected. On the other hand, the dual-port SRAM (DP-SRAM) makes use of the voltage difference between BL pair in the read-out operation, which is suitable for the high-speed operation. In this study, we present a time-sharing scheme using a DP-SRAM cell to achieve high-speed access in 2P-SRAM macros in such image processors.",

There have been sever- al approaches to convert analog systems to their digital counterparts and a high- resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) is a key element for the digitalization of analog circuits. Recently TDCs using a noise shaping technique with oversampling have been introduced to improve resolution. However, they tend to be power hungry or require analog-intensive circuitry as they convert signals from the time domain to the voltage domain in order to perform arithmetic operations. A digital PLL (DPLL) is another crucial SoC component, and low-power area-efficient DPLLs are challenging to design. This paper presents a time-domain low-power \u0394\u03a3 TDC with a time-difference accumulator and an area-efficient, low-power, and fast-lock DPLL composed of a synthesizable bang-bang phase and frequency detector (BB-PFD), with a gain boosting mode and a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).",

        "abstract": "Delay-locked loops (DLLs) are widely adopted for clock generation and synchronization in high performance digital systems. The design of analog DLLs has become a challenge due to the trends associated with CMOS scaling, namely, high leakage current, low supply voltage, etc. Consequently, many designers have shifted their focus to digitally-assisted or all-digitally implemented DLLs, which are easier to design for wide range and fast-locking requirements. Due to the need for wide operating frequency range applications in all-digital DLLs (ADDLLs), many delay cells are normally deployed. As a result, a large portion of the die area is consumed by the delay cells. To address this issue, we develop a phase-tracing delay unit (PTDU) technique to reduce delay-cell usage and achieve low area and low power. In this paper, a 6.7MHz-to-1.24GHz 0.0318mm2 fast-locking ADDLL based on the PTDU method is realized in 90nm CMOS technology.",

        "abstract": "The design of low-jitter VCO-based PLLs is quite challenging as high VCO control gain, KVCO, increases the phase noise contribution arising from the charge pump and loop filter. To resolve this problem, dual-tuning PLLs (DT-PLLs) have been studied [1-4]. The DT-PLL structure adds a narrow-bandwidth coarse (high-KVCO) path to the fine (low-KVCO) path consisting of a type-II PLL. The narrow-bandwidth analog filter in the coarse path plays an important role in preventing the charge pump and the loop filter from increasing the output jitter, while a wide-tuning range is maintained. Moreover, the coarse path adds another pole at origin to the fine path and transforms it from a type-II to type-III PLL [3-4]. Compared to a type-II PLL, owing to its boosted low-frequency loop gain, a type-III PLL can better suppress a low-frequency disturbance to the ring VCO, such as temperature drift. However, a type-III PLL has stability problems. To ensure sufficient phase margin (PM), a type-III PLL requires an extremely narrow-bandwidth (e.g. ~10-100Hz) analog filter in the coarse path or must make the KVCO of the fine path larger. The former requires a nano-Farad capacitor or a fairly complex design for shrinking the capacitance, while the latter way increases total jitter. This paper presents a digitally stabilized type-Ill PLL with a ring VCO. It employs a DT-PLL structure and improves its stability by composing the coarse path with a digital integrator and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). It can set the Kvco of the fine path to 10MHz/V, which is 1000\u03c7 lower than that of the coarse path with a sufficient PM. For further in-band phase-noise reduction, the proposed type-Ill PLL adopts a sub-sampling PLL (SS-PLL) in its fine path [5], and achieves 1.01 psrms integrated jitter.",

        "abstract": "Future imaging applications in the submillimeter-Wave range (300GHz to 3THz) require RF systems that can achieve high sensitivity and portability at low power consumption levels. In particular, CMOS process technologies are attractive due to their low price tag for industrial, surveillance, scientific, and medical applications. Recently, CMOS-based detectors have shown good sensitivity up to 1THz with NEPs on the order of 66pW/\u221a(Hz) at 1THz [1]. However, CMOS terahertz imagers developed thus far have only operated single detectors based on lock-in measurement techniques to acquire raster-scanned images with frame rates on the order of minutes [2]. To address these impediments, we present a low-power 1kpixel terahertz camera chip fully compliant with an industrial 65nm ft/fmax=160GHz/200GHz CMOS process technology. The active-pixel circuit topology is designed to accommodate the optics for wide bandwidth (0.6 to 1THz) in stand-off detection with a 40dBi Si-lens. It includes row/col select and integrate-and-dump circuitry capable of capturing terahertz images with video frame rates up to 25fps at a power consumption of 2.5\u03bcW/pixel.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter and sub-millimeter-wave imaging using solid-state circuits is gaining attention for security and medical applications. To lower cost and increase integration, MOSFETs in CMOS are being investigated for implementing broadband detectors [1-3]. However, neither measured noise-equivalent power (NEP) nor noise floor of the imager was given in [1]. Although NEP of 17pW/Hz1/2 was achieved at 650GHz in [2], an external lens was attached to the 65nm SOI CMOS chip. In [3], an NEP of 66pW/Hz1/2 was measured at 1.05THz using 65nm CMOS without a lens attached to the chip. Additionally, although the efforts reported in [1-3] realized an array, none demonstrated the image-array function. As an alternative, polysilicon-gate-separation (PGS) Schottky-barrier diodes (SBD) with cut-off frequency of ~2THz were fabricated in CMOS without process modifications [4] and were used to demonstrate a 280GHz detector with NEP of 30pW/Hz1/2 [5,6]. To significantly enhance the scanning speed, a 16-pixel 280GHz SBD imager is fabricated and its array function is reported in this paper. The imager including baseband amplifiers achieves responsivity of 5.1kV/W and NEP of 29pW/Hz1/2. More importantly, its operation was demonstrated in a setup that requires no mirror or lens that is bulky and costly. Next, an 860GHz SBD detector is demonstrated with a measured non-amplified responsivity of 355V/W and NEP of 32pW/Hz1/2. This NEP is ~2X lower than the best reported work in CMOS [3]. Both chips are fabricated in a 0.13\u03bcm logic CMOS. The results suggest a path for high performance, compact and affordable sub-millimeter-wave and terahertz CMOS imagers using SBDs.",

        "abstract": "For a highly integrated wireless system including on-chip antennas, high-output- power power amplifiers (PA) are required to cover the desired transmission range. In order to achieve the output power level, power-combining techniques have gained more attention in recent years [1-5]. An efficient power-combining solution is essential since less DC power is needed for the same level of output power, and the difficulties of thermo-dissipation are thus relieved in a high-out- put-power PA. Transformer-based power combining is one of the common tech- niques, which can increase impedance-transformation ratio by increasing the number of input ports and results in a compact layout and reasonable loss [1-3, 5].",

        "abstract": "High-data-rate short-range communication and image systems beyond 100GHz impose crucial requirements on signal sources, demanding superior purity and stability. Using frequency multipliers with high efficiency and multiplication factor to generate the Nth harmonic signal that is phase-locked by a PLL at the fundamental frequency provides an alternative solution. The desired signal in an active frequency multiplier can be generated using Class B/C amplifiers, where a half-wave signal containing all harmonics is first created and then filtered to remove the undesired harmonic components [1]. Another approach is to apply the same signal to both the IF and RF ports of a mixer to construct a doubler followed by cascading to form the quadrupler [3]. The linear superposition (LS) technique that superimposes four phase-shifted half-waves of 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 is another popular scheme [5]. For multipliers with high multiplication factors, these prior techniques may offer very low power efficiency (\u03b7). Quadrupler cores based on Class B/C amplifiers, mixers, or the LS technique had been reported with \u03b7 of 0.9% [1], 0.04% [3] and 0.0002% [5], respectively. Therefore, instead of improving the \u03b7 of the multiplier cores, the design of the subsequent amplifiers after the multiplier to boost the \u03b7 and output power has become a popular approach. We have substantially enhanced the \u03b7 of a frequency quadrupler core using a phase-controlled push-push (PCPP) technique to directly synthesize the 4th harmonic. We noted that in an ideal situation, the proposed quadrupler circuit is able to generate almost no other harmonics, attaining an \u03b7 of 50%. In this paper, we present a 121-to-137GHz frequency quadrupler based on a 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS process. For the purpose of measurement, a balun coupled with buffers to provide the differential signals is also designed. The DC power consumptions o- the quadrupler core and input buffers are 6.4mW and 28.8mW, respectively. Our demonstrated quadrupler core is able to achieve 9% (1.6% including input buffers) power efficiency at 1.6V, with a -2.4dBm output signal.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-Wave-based radar has gained attention in recent years for automotive and object detection applications. Several new applications are also emerging which employ mm-Wave radar techniques to construct short range mm-Wave 3D imaging systems for security screening and biomedical applications. At present, these types of 3D mm-Wave imagers have only been demonstrated in lll-V technology, as CMOS-based radar suffers several range and resolution limitations due to limited output power and linearity.Most CMOS mm-Wave radar systems used in automotive applications are based on Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) ranging techniques in which the carrier is swept to produce a frequency offset at the receiver output proportional to the round-trip distance between the radar and target. While FMCW is an excellent approach for accurate ranging, its implementation becomes particularly difficult at high frequencies as the resolution is heavily dependent on sweep linearity and the high RF front-end performance required to support the wideband swept carrier. For 3D mm-Wave imaging applications, this high operating frequency is indispensable as the attainable spatial (XY) resolution is fundamentally limited by the wavelength of the imaging system. Higher frequency also helps relax focusing lens requirements, as the optical diffraction limit is set by the ratio of the radar wavelength over the lens aperture size.",

Each element of the array requires a variable phase shift to compensate for the time difference between adjacent elements depending on the angle of the incident signals such that a maximum gain is achieved in that particular direction. Conventionally, this phase shift is controlled by the baseband with exhaustive tuning algorithms resulting in very long tuning time as the beam direction is changed, which grows exponentially with the number of elements used.

        "abstract": "Several types of DC-DC converters for active-matrix organic LED (AMOLED) displays have been introduced to date [1-4]. Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) converters with current-mode control have many advantages including reduced PCB space and less cost for mass-production due to the use of only one off-chip inductor to provide many outputs [1,2]. However, a load-dependent stability issue has to be addressed which is due to the output capacitance and an internal integrator with an error amplifier. Recently, in efforts to overcome the stability issue of current-mode control, load-independent control converters have been developed. Although this concept works well, the inductor-current sensing and artificial ramp generation for stability still make the controller complicated [3,4]. In addition, the freewheeling current control converter requires an extra power switch for freewheeling current flow, thereby lowering power efficiency [3]. The vestigial current control converter, meanwhile, has weak points of requiring auxiliary output and an additional inductor, and thus consumes some additional power in the steady state [4]. Besides the controller issue, the previous converters when operating with a large step-up ratio, usually have heavy voltage stress applied to the inductor, resulting in a low efficiency [1,4]. To overcome these problems, the proposed SIMO converter employs emulated absolute current hysteretic control, which uses full current information and is characterized by intrinsic high stability. The energy sharing capacitor is also used for high output voltage to reduce the voltage swing of the switching node and the associated loss. In addition, to balance the total energy across the inductor, the energy balancing capacitor is adopted.",

        "abstract": "Non-isolation LED drivers [1] are more attractive than isolated drivers in terms of efficiency and lower fabrication cost. However, some areas such as bar-typed fluorescent lamp retrofit applications still require a solution with isolation. Even for replacement of the incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps, some LED lamp makers prefer isolated driver solutions due to safety issues. One of the popular solutions is the flyback converter which is widely used in low-to-moderate power applications [2]. However, generally, it requires secondary voltage or current-sense circuit, and opto-coupler isolator to form a feedback loop. Thus, primary-side regulation (PSR) flyback converters have been steadily used in LED applications since they do not need secondary circuits and isolator [3]. This paper introduces a PSR method for LED lamp which satisfies low price, good efficiency, high power factor (PF) and triode AC switch (TRIAC) dimming control.",

        "abstract": "Several emerging portable applications require high-efficiency LED drivers [1-4]. An LED driver is basically a current source that forces the current required for achieving the desired light emission into the LED. In order to increase the LED driver efficiency, besides controlling the LED current, it is necessary to regulate the voltage applied to the LED itself, to minimize the voltage drop across the driver current source and, hence, the power consumption. Depending on the kind of LED and on the current forced through the LED itself (0.1 to 2A in this design) and, hence, on the desired light emission, the voltage required to drive the LED, while maintaining the voltage headroom across the driver current source to the minimum, varies over a wide range (0 to 5V). Starting from a standard voltage supply in the range 2.7 to 5.5V, a buck-boost DC-DC converter is then required (Fig. 16.4.1). The buck-boost DC-DC converter includes the LED in the control feedback loop and has to provide fast turn-on and load transients (on the order of 20\u03bcs), in order to allow pulsed operation of the LED itself.",

        "abstract": "The traditional inductor-based buck converter has been the dominant design for step-down switched-mode voltage regulators for decades. Switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters, on the other hand, have traditionally been used in low- power (<;10mW) and low-conversion-ratio (<;4:1) applications where neither regulation nor efficiency is critical. However, a number of SC converter topologies are very effective in their utilization of switches and passive elements, especially in relation to the ever-popular buck converters [1,2,5]. This work encompasses the complete design, fabrication, and test of a CMOS-based switched-capacitor DC-DC converter, addressing the ubiquitous 12 to 1.5V board-mounted point-of-load application. In particular, the circuit developed in this work attains higher efficiency (92% peak, and >;80% over a load range of 5mA to 1A) than surveyed competitive buck converters, while requiring less board area and less costly passive components. The topology and controller enable a wide input voltage (V!N) range of 7.5 to 13.5V with an output voltage (V\u03bfu\u03c4) of 1.5V Control techniques based on feedback and feedforward provide tight regulation (30mVpp) under worst-case load-step (1A) conditions. This work shows that SC converters can outperform buck converters, and thus the scope of SC converter applications can and should be expanded.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a high demand for highly efficient power converters that can be put in systems such as power factor correctors or solar panels. A silicon carbide (SiC) based power switch has a very good performance when it comes to switching and conduction losses. As on silicon, the manufacturing of junction devices is easier than MOSFET devices because the growth of highly reliable oxide is very challenging [1]. Recently, a family of high-voltage SiC junction FET (JFET) transistors has been developed which has made it possible to reach an efficiency of more than 99% with a buck converter. The low switching loss of these transistors allows for the use of a higher switching frequency and smaller external components which in turn reduce PCB area and overall system cost. A dedicated gate driver with possible bootstrap operation has been developed for a normally-on n-type JFET. It allows maximum efficiency, operation as safe as that of a normally-off switch, and reduced number of external components because of integration of voltage regulator and supervision circuitry. Bootstrapping minimizes the number of supplies needed for the power converter and reduces board space and BOM.",

Inductive power transmission across the skin is a viable solution for providing sufficient power to such IMDs without imposing size and power constraints of implanted batteries [2]. On the down side, unlike batteries that provide a stable power source, unexpected variations in the coils' mutual coupling from misalignments can lead to wide variations in the received voltage across the secondary coil to the extent that the input voltage may not be sufficient to supply power to the IMD [3]. Hence, there is a need to improve the robustness of inductive power transmission without sacrificing efficiency to allow the IMDs to operate over a wider range of received input voltages. There are also other applications such as wireless sensors and radio-frequency identification (RFID), in which extending the range of loosely coupled inductive links are highly desired.",

        "abstract": "Electro-acupuncture (EA), a combination of acupuncture and electrical stimulation, has been widely used for its effectiveness in pain relief since the 1970s [1] and later for treatment of various diseases such as depression, addiction, and gastrointestinal disorders [2], and non-medical applications including obesity treatment [3]. For stimulation, most EA systems use a pair of needles with long, thick wires connected to an external power supply to form a closed current loop. The thin (\u03c6=2mm) needle may suffer from the inconvenient and unstable connection to the thick wire and if there are many needles, it is difficult to supply power to all needles [4]. Recently, a wirelessly-powered EA system was proposed in [4] to remove the wire connections for convenient treatment, but its wireless power harvesting generated only 8\u03bcW which is not enough for various applications [1-3]. Most EA systems use bi-phase stimulation to reduce tissue damage, electrolysis, and electrolytic degradation [5]. However, the high-precision balancing of a bi-phase current pulse is difficult to achieve because the required offset, <;10nA [6], is only on the order of 10<;sup>;-5<;/sup>; of the stimulation current level, ~1mA. Furthermore, none of the previous EA systems have any feedback mechanism to enable adaptive stimulation by showing the real-time status of the EA stimulation to the patient.",

        "abstract": "In recent years there has been significant interest and growth in low-power wireless technologies beyond traditional consumer use cases into medical applications [1]. Previously a bastion for application specific wireless propriety protocols, the WBAN community has worked together to develop a communication standard IEEE802.15.6 optimised for low power devices in and around the human body offering the levels of QoS required for personal medical data. Additionally, the consumer electronic industry has migrated existing standardised wireless protocols such as Bluetooth to meet the demanding low energy yet robust needs of WBAN. This paper presents a transceiver chip for both IEEE802.15.6 Narrow-Band (NB) PHY draft [2] and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) 4.0 standards as well as proprietary protocols. Multi-mode operation offers the best solution in terms of flexibility and interoperability between devices and networks, and the appropriate protocol can be chosen to optimise power consumption in numerous applications scenarios where data throughput varies dramatically; such as streaming multi-lead ECG or episodic temperature measurements. The chip operates in the 2.36GHz MBANs spectrum, specifically allocated for medical devices, and the worldwide 2.4GHz ISM band. A TX for the 780/868/915/950MHz licence-free bands in China, EU, North America and Japan respectively, is also included. The chip is architected and designed for 5mW peak active power dissipation for compatibility with 1V button cells, hence enabling small-form factor non-intrusive body worn applications.",

However, the extreme power requirements of fluid locomotion impose significant design challenges. Using highly efficient and scalable electromagnetic propulsion systems, these locomotive devices become possible. Recent work shows that mm-sized antennas in tissue achieve optimal power transfer efficiency in the low-GHz range. Combining this power transfer method with the highly efficient propulsion, a fully wireless locomotive implant capable of moving at 0.53cm/s has been realized in 65nm CMOS with a 2mm \u00d7 2mm receive antenna and a 0.6\u00d71mm2 die size with a 2W 1.86GHz carrier. The design consists of an RF frontend, bandgap reference, regulator, demodulator, digital control, and configurable high-current drivers for the propulsion system.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present both a 1D and a 2D 4x4 capacitive touch sensor built in a dual-gate organic thin-film transistor technology on flexible foil. The maximal sample rate of the sensor read-out is 1.5kS/s, which results in a refresh rate of 93Hz for the 2D touch pad. With the given performance it is technically feasible to increase the sensor area by 4X to ~50cm2 with the same accuracy reaching a refresh rate of 23Hz. The analog sensor output can further be interpolated and an example is given that proves at least a single bit of improvement per dimension. The output of the touch sensors is given by a ratio of capacitances and consequently the sensor is insensitive to variations and is air-stable. The 1D and 2D sensors measure 1.0x4.4cm2 and 3.5x3.5cm2 respectively. The sensor chip micrographs are presented in the figure.",

        "abstract": "The ambition of printing item-level RFID tags is one of the driving forces behind printed electronics research. Organic RFID tags have been shown, initially using p-type organic semiconductors [1-4]. The introduction of n-type organic semiconductors with reasonable performance made organic CMOS conceivable [5] and organic CMOS RFID tags were shown [6]. However, all currently reported organic RFID tags are based on a tag-talks-first principle: as soon as the tag gets powered from the RF field, its code is transmitted at a data rate determined by an internal ring oscillator. Practical RFID systems will need to be able to read multiple RFID tags within the reach of the reader antenna. Existing anti-collision protocols implemented in organic RFID tags [2,4] are limited to about maximum 4 tags and come at the cost of a slow reading time. In this paper, we for the first time realize a reader-talks-first low-temperature thin-film transistor (TFT) RFID circuit. We use a complementary hybrid organic/oxide technology. As organic transistors with reasonable channel lengths (\u22652\u03bcm) have a cut-off frequency below 13.56MHz, the base carrier frequency of HF communication, present technologies on foil do not yet allow to extract the circuit clock as a fraction of the base carrier. We solve this by introducing an original uplink (reader-to-tag) scheme, in which a slow clock (compatible with our transistors' speed) is transmitted as amplitude-modulation on the base carrier while data is encoded on this clock by pulse width modulation (PWM).",

        "abstract": "Amorphous Gallium-lndium-Zinc-Oxide (GIZO or IGZO) has been recently pro- posed [1] as an interesting semiconductor for manufacturing TFTs because of its mobility (\u03bc~20cm7Vs), superior to other common materials for large-area elec- tronics like organic semiconductors and a-Si (\u03bc~1cm7Vs). The amorphous nature of GIZO grants also a good uniformity, contrary to Low Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon (LTPS), which still offers the best mobility among large- area TFT technologies (\u03bc~100cm2\u039b/s). The optical transparency and the relative- ly low fabrication temperature (<;150\u00b0C) make this technology especially suitable for display backplanes and relative driving electronics [2], as well as for any kind of large-area applications on plastic foils, e.g. biomedical sensors, non-volatile memories [3], RFIDs [4], etc.",

While silicon based data transceivers at mm-wave frequencies have become increasingly mature in recent years [1,2,3], the primary focus of the circuit community remains on the design of mm-wave front-ends to achieve higher data rates through higher-order modulation and beamforming techniques. However, the sustainability of such mm-wave systems when integrated in a SoC has not been addressed in the context of die performance yield and device aging. This problem is especially challenging for the implementation of mm-wave SoC's in deep sub-micron technology due to its process & operating temperature variations and limited ft / fmax with respect to the operation frequency.",

This paper presents a hybrid low-power, high-resolution e nose system, including the necessary digital interface. An integrated readout was designed for the tracking of resonant frequency shift due to a change in the VOC environment concentration. It interfaces a piezo-actuated functionalized doubly clamped beam resonator that combines low actuation power (\u03bcW), high VOC sensitivity but low quality factor in air, large parasitic capacitance and multiple resonance modes. The sensor characteristics translate into a challenging readout design, as high gain-bandwidth product versus low power and low noise are required for optimal detection resolution.",

Such speeds represent a near doubling of the state-of-the-art for fully integrated transceivers [1-3]. With scaling no longer providing large gains in device speed, significant design advances must be made to attain these data rates. This paper describes a 28Gb/s serial link transceiver featuring a source-series terminated (SST) driver topology with twice the speed of existing designs, a two-stage peaking amplifier with capacitively-coupled parallel input stages and active feedback, and a 15-tap DFE. The use of capacitive level-shifters allows a single current-integrating summer to drive the parallel paths used for speculating the first two DFE taps.",

        "abstract": "Serial data links are often designed targeting a specific transmission medium. High-speed links using different predetermined transmission media have been demonstrated in the past [1-3]. This, however, restricts user's ability to use an integrated link interface with other transmission media once the chip is fabricated. For example, traditional transceivers for copper interconnects typically transmit baseband data, which is incompatible with a free-space wireless channel that is bandpass in nature and often uses RF carriers. A multi-modality transceiver block compatible with different transmission media is highly desirable as it offers great versatility by allowing the exact same interface circuitry to be used with different transmission media. Such a versatile interface can relax the board and system design requirements and enable the reuse of the same transceiver core with different media, reducing the time and cost overhead of re-designing and re-manufacturing.",

In addition, its single-ended topology facilitates an architecture in which the delay mismatch between true and complementary output can be adjusted, as is desirable for data transmission over long cables. In this contribution, the architecture and design of the key components of a half-rate 28Gb/s SST TX are presented.",

While the use of injection locking reduces the output jitter, one disadvantage is that the output frequency can be changed only by integer multiples of the reference frequency, if it can be changed at all. In this work, an ADPLL-based clock generator is presented that employs a fractional-injection-locking method that exploits the multiphase output of a ring oscillator. The clock generator achieves an average of 4.23 psrms jitter and a frequency resolution of 1MHz while using a reference clock of 32MHz.",

        "abstract": "A low-phase-noise integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL) is attractive in many applications, such as clock generation and analog-to-digital conversion. The sub-harmonically injection-locked technique, sub-sampling technique, and the multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) can significantly improve the phase noise of an integer-N PLL. In the sub-harmonically injection-locked technique, to inject a low-frequency reference clock into a high-frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the injection timing should be tightly controlled. If the injection timing varies due to process variation, it may cause a large reference spur or even cause the PLL to fails to lock. A sub-harmonically injection-locked PLL (SILPLL) adopts a sub-sampling phase-detector (PD) to automatically align the phase between the injection pulse and a VCO. However, a sub-sampling PD has a small capture range and a low bandwidth. The high-frequency non-linear effects of a sub-sampling PD may degrade the accuracy and limit the maximum speed of a VCO. In addition, a frequency-locked loop is needed for a sub-sampling PD. A delay line is manually adjusted to achieve the correct injection timing. However, the delay line is sensitive to process variations. Thus, the injection timing should be calibrated.",

        "abstract": "Bang-Bang all-digital PLLs [1] for applications such as digital clock multiplication have existed for a long time, but show limited phase noise performance. Pioneering recent work [2-5] has demonstrated frequency synthesizers that meet the performance requirements of wireless communications systems, while containing no analog circuits except for an LC-oscillator. In order to build an All-Digital Phase-Locked Loop (ADPLL), it is necessary to measure the oscillator's momentary phase accurately, in a digital way, since the output phase noise at frequencies within the PLL loop bandwidth is ultimately limited by the time quantisation step \u0394t of this phase measurement [6]: L=20.log10 (\u0394t\u00b7\u03c9osc/\u221a12\u00b7\u221afsample) [dBc/Hz] (1) In [2-5], a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) is used to measure the oscillator's phase with a resolution of a single inverter delay. However, this approach requires calibration of the TDC conversion gain. Previous work [2] included a small microprocessor incorporated in the PLL circuit, to perform all necessary calculations related to the calibration. Obviously, this renders the circuit complex, is prone to calibration errors and consumes power and area. In this paper, an alternative approach is presented, allowing all-digital frequency synthesizers that meet the requirements for wireless communications standards, that benefit from the benign scaling properties, porting properties, process independence and controlled design flow, inherent to digital circuits, but that, on the other hand, do not require the burden of calibration and associated calculations.",

        "abstract": "The RF front-ends of modern smart phones are becoming more complicated as newer standards are introduced (e.g. LTE). Reconfigurability can be used to reduce their size, provided that power consumption is not adversely affected. For 2G/3G transceivers, local oscillator (LO) generation requires significant area and power. Reconfigurable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) are generally used to maximize the achievable tuning range to reduce their number in the presence of many supported bands. However, no VCO capable to support both WCDMA and GSM has been reported that is also competitive with the power consumption achieved using two separate oscillators. In fact, the very demanding GSM phase-noise specs require a current up to four times higher (depending on the duplexer selectivity) than that used in the WCDMA case. In the design of an LC-tank harmonic oscillator, phase noise normalized to power consumption (i.e. the figure-of-merit, FOM), reaches an optimum at the maximum oscillation amplitude compatible with the supply voltage Vdd. This condition impairs the power reconfigurability of a VCO, since there is only one value of bias current yielding the highest FOM, once tank and Vdd are chosen. On the other hand, making the tank reconfigurable invariably results in a degradation of its Q, i.e. a reduced FOM.",

In GSM mobile stations (MS), the transmit and receive bands are 20MHz apart, which sets a stringent TX phase noise requirement of -162dBc/Hz at 20MHz offset [1].

        "abstract": "A VCO used in a PLL inside a wireless transceiver can be sensitive to interference from other radio circuitry (e.g. on-chip PA), components of the SoC system (e.g. clocks and their harmonics) and nearby radios. To prevent VCO pulling by the PA, fractional dividers can be used to offset the VCO frequency (fVCO) with respect to the PA. Multistandard radios covering, for example, WiFi 2.4 to 2.5GHz and 5 to 5.8GHz, and WiMAX 2.3 to 2.7GHz and 3.3 to 3.8GHz, may require multiple VCOs and/or multiple fractional dividers to cover all bands [1], resulting in complexity and area overhead. This paper proposes a versatile reconfigurable fractional divider capable of covering the above standards with a single VCO with 20% tuning range. The divider is all-digital, hence scaling-friendly, and uses digital calibration to eliminate the need for filtering and area-intensive inductors. The versatility afforded by the reconfigurable fractional divider allows for the transceiver's LO generation (LOG) frequency plan to be adjusted on-the-fly. This can avoid VCO pulling from interferers which may not be known a-priori, like SoC-CPU clocks that are adjusted dynamically for best performance.",

As shown in [1], challenging phase-noise requirements can embrace the WCDMA transmitter as well (e.g. -166dBc/Hz at 45MHz frequency offset for WCDMA band VIII), if cheap antenna duplexers are chosen to minimize costs. In such scenarios, and particularly in the very relevant case of WCDMA transmitting at moderate power levels, the LO power efficiency is still one of the limiting factors for a long-lasting battery life, motivating the ongoing quest for VCO power optimization.",

        "abstract": "The trend towards reconfigurable receivers requires on-chip flexible filters that can replace dedicated, bulky and non-tunable filters (e.g., SAW and BAW [1]). Although BAW filters are compatible with silicon processes, their center frequency is sensitive to thickness variation of the piezoelectric material and the achievable tuneability is limited [1]. Other techniques to make RF on-chip band-pass filters (BPFs) include Q-enhancement, gm-C and N-path. Q-enhancement approach has several disadvantages such as large area due to inductors which do not obey process scaling, limited tuneability and poor dynamic range [2]. Main drawbacks of gm-C filters are the tradeoff between power consumption, quality factor, center frequency and dynamic range and the need for tuning circuitry [3]. Recently there has been renewed interest in the translational impedance conversion of N-path filters [4-6]. Due to the \u201ctransparency\u201d of the passive mixer, baseband impedance is translated to frequencies around the clock frequency flo [7]. The interesting features of these filters are their direct tuneability with flo, higher quality factor compared to on-chip CMOS LC filters [2], high linearity and graceful scaling with process.",

        "abstract": "Integrators are key building blocks in many analog signal processing circuits and systems. They are typically implemented using either an opamp-RC or a Gm-C architecture depending on bandwidth and linearity requirements. The performance of both these topologies depends on the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) used to implement the integrator. Reduced supply voltage and lower transistor output impedance make it difficult to implement high-gain wide-bandwidth OTAs in a power-efficient manner. Consequently, the DC gain of the integrator is often severely limited when designed in deep-submicron CMOS processes. Conventional integrators employ multi-stage OTAs operating in weak inversion and forward body biasing to achieve large DC gain at low supply voltages [1]. These techniques require automatic biasing to guarantee robust operation under all conditions and the use of frequency compensation combined with large dimensions needed to bias the transistors in weak inversion severely limits the bandwidth and increases power dissipation. In this paper, we propose a ring-oscillator-based integrator (ROI) that seeks to overcome the limitations of conventional OTA-based integrators.",

In this technique, two critical parameters should be accounted for: the accuracy of the Q factors of the pole pairs (for correct transfer function) and parasitic capacitances (for maximal cut-off frequency). The former point is influenced by the phase shift of the integrators compounding the filter in the neighborhood of the filter's edge frequency. This phase error is due to two antagonistic effects which are the integrator's finite DC gain and its high-frequency poles/zeros.",

        "abstract": "Todays ICs usually employ one bandgap voltage reference (BGVR) circuit to generate a well defined voltage that is reused at many places in that IC. The classical BGVR generates a reference voltage that is slightly larger than the material bandgap: a little above 1200mV in silicon. For deep-sub-micron technologies the supply voltage is about the same as the material bandgap which prevents using the classical bandgap structure. As a solution a number of BGVR topologies that create a sub-1V are invented; most of them are based on the structure introduced by Banba [1], some are using resistive voltage division [2] or voltage averaging [3]. For low-power operation high-ohmic resistors (occupying a large area!) must be used in all these techniques, leading to an immediate trade-off between power consumption and chip-area. This trade-off prevents the local generation of reference voltages where they are required: either the power penalty or the area penalty would be too significant. Alternative topologies that do not require high-ohmic resistors typically are not-BGVR-based circuits relying on threshold voltages and hence require trimming to achieve low spread.",

The reference buffers based on multi-stage amplifiers can enhance the precision under low-voltage supplies, but are exposed to instability when loaded by such large capacitive loads (CL). Frequency compensation via damping-factor control [2] is capable of extending the CL-drivability up to 1nF, however, at the cost of penalizing the power (426\u03bcW) and area (0.14mm2). Although recent works [3-4] have enhanced gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew rate (SR) showing better FOMS (=GBW\u00b7CL/Power) and FOML (=SR\u00b7CL/Power), the CL-drivability has not been improved (i.e., 0.8nF in [3] and 0.15nF in [4]). This paper describes a three-stage amplifier managed to afford particularly large and wide range of CL (1 to 15nF) with optimized power (144\u03bcW) and die size (0.016mm2), being very suitable for compact LCD drivers [5] with different resolution targets. The design barriers are methodically surmounted via local feedback loop (LFL) analysis expanded from [6], which is an insightful control-centric method. Measured at 15nF CL, the attained FOMS (FOML) is >;4.48\u00d7 (>;2.55\u00d7) beyond that of the state-of-the-art (Fig. 21.6.1).",

        "abstract": "Transducer drivers for ultrasound imaging are required to have high output power and operation frequency into the MHz range. Furthermore, in harmonic imaging, a well-established method resulting in enhanced contrast, higher harmonic echoes (usually the second) of the fundamental transmitted frequency, either generated by reflection from micro-bubbles or on propagation, are selectively detected and used for imaging [1]. As a consequence, the second harmonic of the transmitted signal is suppressed as much as possible and the received signal is derived solely from the nonlinear behavior of the body. Pulsers are usually adopted having high efficiency, being simple and lending themselves to harmonic imaging for example by means of out-of-phase pulse transmission techniques [1]. Output signals with arbitrary shape allow better performances, enabling apodization profiles with high resolution, beams with low harmonic content and instantaneous changes in transmit energy between pulses [2]. However, the implementation of arbitrary waveform generators in commercial solutions is presently limited to high-end systems because of manufacturing costs, power dissipation and space constraints. To this extent, the availability of an adequate IC technology such as BCD, handling high dynamic range signals at high frequency and capable of multi-watt level driving, opens up to the investigation of integrated amplifier topologies [3]. Advantages in terms of EM interference reduction, reliability improvement, space and cost would derive. Achieving adequate gain-bandwidth products is nonetheless challenging considering the limited fT of high voltage devices.",

The CCIA does not draw supply current from its input terminals or require a separate high-voltage (HV) supply; and has a common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) in excess of 160dB, both of which represent significant improvements on the state-of-the-art [1-3].

        "abstract": "For low-light-level imaging, the performance of a CMOS image sensor (CIS) is usually limited by the temporal readout noise (TRN) generated from its analog readout circuit chain. Although a sub-electron TRN level can be achieved with a high-gain pixel-level amplifier, the pixel uniformity is highly impaired up to a few percent by its open-loop amplifier structure [1]. The TRN can be suppressed without this penalty by employing either a high-gain column-level amplifier [2] or a correlated multiple sampling (CMS) technique [3-5]. However, only 1-to-2 electron TRN level has been reported with the individual use of these approaches [2-5], and the low-frequency noise of the in-pixel source follower i.e. 1/f and RTS noise is a further limitation. Therefore, by implementing a high-gain column-level amplifier and CMS technique together with an in-pixel buried-channel source follower (BSF) [6], the TRN level can be reduced even further.",

        "abstract": "The demand for high-quality and high-speed imaging has increased. Column-parallel \u226514b A/D conversion is one of the major approaches to meet these requirements in CMOS image sensors (CIS). Oversampling ADCs such as incremental delta-sigma (I-\u0394\u03a3) ADCs are the solution for a high-resolution ADC having tolerance of analog component errors. Oversampling reduces input temporal noise as well as the quantization error of the ADC itself [1]. However, an I-\u0394\u03a3 ADC is also classified as a slow ADC because it requires exponential conversion time to get higher bit resolution. To reduce conversion time, there are two alternative methods: 1) higher-order modulation, and 2) two-step conversion such as an extended-counting technique [2]. In this paper, the extended-counting (EC) method is used since a high-order structure requires more complex hardware and greater power consumption [1,2]. For a general two-step ADC, coarse conversion restricts the total ADC resolution since it determines accuracy of the residue. However, an EC ADC overcomes the accuracy limitation, since the I-\u0394\u03a3 can improve its precision through oversampling. Moreover, oversampling also suppresses the noise of the pixel's source follower. Our 14b EC ADC is a blend of a 1st-order I-\u0394\u03a3 ADC and a cyclic ADC to simultaneously get high resolution and high speed.",

The time-division readout architecture for both image types (color and depth) is maintained. A complete redesign of the imager makes pixels smaller and more sensitive than before. To obtain reliable depth information using a pinned-photodiode, a depth pixel is split into eight small pieces for high-speed charge transfer, and demodulated electrons are merged into one large storage node, enabling phase delay measurement with 52.8% demodulation contrast at 20MHz frequency. Furthermore, each split pixel gener- ates its own color information, offering a 2D image with full-HD resolution (1920x1080).",

        "abstract": "Energy consumption is a dominant constraint on the performance of modern microprocessors and systems-on-chip. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a promising technique for performing \u201con-the-fly\u201d energy-performance optimization in the presence of workload variability. Effective implementation of DVFS requires voltage regulators that can provide many independent power supplies and can transition power supply levels on nanosecond timescales, which is not possible with modern board-level voltage regulator modules (VRMs) [1]. Switched-inductor integrated voltage regulators (IVRs) can enable effective implementation of DVFS, eliminating the need for separate VRMs and reducing power distribution network (PDN) impedance requirements by performing dc-dc conversion close to the load while supporting high peak current densities [2-3]. The primary obstacle facing development of IVRs is integration of suitable power inductors. This work presents an early prototype switched-inductor IVR using 2.5D chip stacking for inductor integration.",

        "abstract": "Outstanding GaN-based HFETs (HFET: Heterojunction Field-Effect Transistors) [1] power devices are expected to replace all Si power devices in high power applications such as inverter systems due to their excellent performance. In order to exploit the full potential of such emerging GaN power devices, the gate driver that controls the device by a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal is becoming more important. The vital function of the gate driver is to provide an isolated gate signal against the reference source voltage that operates at high voltage. In addition to this function, their integration with GaN power HFETs is also desirable to achieve smaller system size, lower cost and user-friendliness. Although there are several signal isolation techniques for a gate driver such as to use a photo-coupler and wireless pulse transformer [2], these techniques have disadvantages such as large system size and difficulty in integration. Other bootstrap or charge pump techniques [3] in high voltage gate drivers (HVIC) have been developed to generate a reference voltage, but the driver can only be used in particular applications such as inverters. Meanwhile, we have focused our attention on the recent technology of wireless power transmission using an electromagnetic resonant coupler (EMRC) [4] with an open-ring resonator [5], which is very attractive due to its high efficiency in power transmission and its compactness at high frequency.",

        "abstract": "SRAM based configuration memory is the primary contributor to the large area, delay, and power consumption of FPGAs relative to ASICs. In [1] it is estimated that a 3D-FPGA with the configuration memory stacked on top of the FPGA logic and routing can achieve 57% smaller die area than a baseline 2D-FPGA in 65nm CMOS technology. Motivated by these potential performance gains, several programmable logic devices with different monolithically stacked configuration memory technologies have been reported [2-4]. These memory technologies, however, require materials and/or processes that may not be compatible or scalable with CMOS processes. This paper presents the first 3D-FPGA with stacked configuration memory based on the emerging nonvolatile Resistive RAM (RRAM) technology described in [5], which is both compatible and scalable with CMOS.",

Earlier AFE implementations for this standard have utilized a transmitter hybrid configuration requiring multiple DACs with stringent inter-DAC matching requirements [2-3]. This paper describes a new AFE architecture using a single DAC and line-driver to achieve better echo-cancellation linearity. The design achieves >;59dB TX SFDR and >;68dB echo-cancellation (EC) SFDR across 400MHz bandwidth. The AFE receiver circuitry consists of PGA and 2\u00d7 time-interleaved SHA-less 11b pipelined ADC operating at 800MS/s. Measured receive noise floor and SFDR is <;-144dBm/Hz and >;53dB, respectively. The AFE dissipates less than 2W power, occupies 17mm2 silicon area including 4 lanes with clocking circuitry, and is implemented in a 40nm triple-gate 0.9V/1.2V/2.5V CMOS process.",

        "abstract": "Emerging symmetric 10Gb/s passive optical network (PON) systems aim at high network transmission efficiency by reducing the RX settling time that is needed for RX amplitude recovery in burst-mode (BM). A conventional AC-coupled BM- RX has an inherent tradeoff between short settling time and decision threshold droop, which makes an RX settling time shorter than 400ns hard to achieve. Some techniques have been developed to overcome this limitation, demonstrating a settling time of 150 to 200ns. Our previous work uses feed-forward automatic offset compensation (AOC) to achieve a response time as short as 25.6ns. However, a feed-forward scheme using peak detectors is intrinsically less accurate and results in relatively high power consumption. In this paper, we present a DC-coupled 10Gb/s BM-TIA and burst-mode limiting amplifier (BM- LA) chipset that uses a feedback type AOC circuit with switchable loop BW. This new technique is capable of removing input DC offset in less than 75ns, and offers continuous decision threshold tracking during payload, to cope with the maximum length of CID. The differential TIA output port senses a CM reset signal provided by the succeeding BM-LA, and activates an on-chip reset and lock function. This BM-LA also integrates auto reset/activity generation circuits providing the AOC BW switching signal, so that this time-critical signal is not required from the PON system.",

Continuous lowering of bit cost, increasing flash-memory-die densities and improving performance have helped to expand flash markets.

The other is focusing on high performance and high reliability. To meet both demands, we develop a 19nm 112.8mm2 64Gb 2b/cell NAND flash memory with the smallest die size ever reported. 15MB/s programming throughput and 400Mb/s/pin 1.8V Toggle Mode interface [3] are achieved for the first time.

        "abstract": "Solid-state drives (SSDs), built with many flash memory channels, is usually connected to the host through an advanced high-speed serial interface such as SATA III associated with a transfer rate of 6Gb/s [1-2]. However, the performance of SSD is in general determined by the throughput of the ECC blocks necessary to overcome the high error-rate [3]. The binary BCH code is widely used for the SSD due to its powerful error-correction capability. As it is hard to achieve high-throughput strong BCH decoders [4-5], multiple BCH decoders are typically on a high-performance SSD controller, leading to a significant increase of hardware complexity. This paper presents an efficient BCH encoder/decoder architecture achieving a decoding throughput of 6Gb/s. The overall architecture shown in Fig. 25.3.1 includes a single BCH decoder and a multi-threaded BCH encoder. The single BCH encoder is responsible for all the channels and services a channel at a time in a round-robin manner.",

To meet such a demand, we present a 64Gb multilevel cell (MLC) NAND Flash memory having 533Mb/s DDR interface in sub-20nm technology. Large floating-gate (FG) coupling interference and program disturbance are major challenges to impede the scaling of NAND Flash memories in sub-20nm technology node [1]. In this paper, we present correction-before-coupling (CBC) reprogram and P3-pattern pre-pulse scheme, allowing us to overcome large FG coupling interferences. We improve program disturbance by inventing inhibit-channel-coupling-reduction (ICCR) technique. In addition, we achieve a 533Mb/s DDR interface by employing a wave-pipeline architecture [2].",

First, memory cell and array technologies reduce the sneak current with a newly developed bidirectional diode as a memory cell select element for the first time. Second, we use a hierarchical bitline (BL) structure for multi-layered cross-point memory with fast and stable current control. Third, we implement a multi-bit write architecture that realizes fast write operation and suppresses sneak current.

        "abstract": "Numerous low-supply-voltage (VDD) mobile chips, such as energy-harvesting-powered devices and biomedical applications, require low-VDD on-chip nonvolatile memory (NVM) for low-power active-mode access and power-off data storage. However, conventional NVMs cannot achieve low-VDD operation due to insufficient write voltage generated by charge-pumped (CP) circuits at a low VDD, and a lack of low-VDD current-mode sense amplifiers (CSA) [1-4] to overcome read issues in reduced sensing margins, degraded speeds, and insufficient voltage headroom (VHR). Resistive RAM (ReRAM) [4-6] is a promising memory with the advantages of short write time, low write-voltage, and reduced write power compared to Flash and other NVMs. Using a low-VDD CP with relaxed output voltage/current requirements for write operations, ReRAM is a good candidate for on-chip low-VDD NVM if a low-VDD CSA is provided, particularly for frequent-read-seldom-write applications. We develop a body-drain-driven CSA (BDD-CSA) with dynamic BL bias voltage (VBL) and small VHR for larger sensing margins to achieve a lower VDDmin, faster read speed, and better tolerance of read cell current (ICELL) and BL leakage current (IBL-LEAK) variations compared to conventional CSAs. A fabricated 65nm 4Mb ReRAM macro using the BDD-CSA and our CMOS-logic-compatible ReRAM cell [7] achieves 0.5V VDDmin. The BDD-CSA achieves 0.32V VDDmin.",

        "abstract": "Short-distance (<;10cm) wireless communications applications are rapidly expanding. For instance, a fast file transfer by \u201ctouch-and-proceed data communication\u201d provides a user-friendly interface for electronic products [1,2]. Wireless I/O's may replace conventional connectors on a PCB to overcome performance limitations [3,4]. High-speed (>;Gb/s), low energy dissipation (<;100pJ/b), low bit-error-rate (BER<;10-3), and low cost (small layout area in matured CMOS processes) are required as well as compliance with spectral regulation and EMI/EMS. None of the previous research achievements has satisfied all these requirements (Fig. 26.2.6). Non-coherent UWB transceivers are typically low speed and energy hungry; i.e. 15Mb/s with 2680pJ/b in a heterodyne transceiver [1] and 1Mb/s with 373pJ/b in a direct-conversion transceiver [3]. Millimeter-Wave radio is often used to raise the data rate at the cost of increase in energy dissipation. A heterodyne non-coherent 60GHz transceiver performed 2.5Gb/s with 114pJ/b [2]. To further reduce the energy dissipation a direct-conversion coherent 56GHz transceiver was developed in 40nm CMOS and 11Gb/s was achieved with 6.4pJ/b [4]. Unfortunately, as a free-running TX LO and injection-lock carrier synchronization were employed, the injection locking range was very narrow. For an RF input power of -30dBm, the locking range was 60MHz, only 0.1% of the center frequency. Tight control of frequency under variation and noise is not easy for manufacturing. Raising the RF input power is also limited by the FCC spectral mask regulation. In this paper, we present a UWB direct-conversion coherent transceiver in 90nm CMOS. 2Gb/s with 75pJ/b is achieved while meeting the FCC regulation for indoor communications. An IQ-switching carrier recovery scheme is proposed to save layout area and energy dissipation by 43% and 20%, respectively, compared with those in the conventional Costas loop. The transceiver - ith the proposed carrier recovery scheme uses binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation.",

        "abstract": "Wake-up radios have been a popular transceiver architecture in recent years for battery-powered applications such as wireless body area networks (WBANs) [1], wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [2,3], and even electronic toll collection systems (ETCS) [4]. The most important consideration in implementing a wake-up receiver (WuRX) is low power dissipation while maximizing sensitivity. Because of this requirement of very low power, WuRX are usually designed by a simple RF envelope detector (RFED) consisting of Schottky diodes [1,3] or MOSFETs in the weak inversion region [2] without active filtering or amplification of the input signal. Therefore, the performance of the RFED itself is critical for attaining good sensitivity of the WuRX. Moreover, the poor filtering of the input signal renders the WuRX vulnerable to interferers from nearby terminals with high transmit power such as mobile phones and WiFi devices, and this can result in false wake-ups [1]. Although the RFED has very low power, a false wake-up will increase the power consumption of the wake-up radio as it will enable the power-hungry main transceiver.",

Several 2.3/2.4GHz wireless standards have been proposed for such applications, including IEEE802.15.6 (BAN) for body area networks, IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for sensor networks and IEEE802.15.4g (SUN) for smart buildings. Recent standard compliant short-range TXs [1-6] typically consume DC power in the range of 20 to 50mW. This is rather high for autonomous systems with limited battery energy. Implemented in a 90nm CMOS technology, the presented TX saves at least 75% of power consumption by replacing several power-hungry analog blocks with the digitally-assisted circuits. This TX is compliant with all 4 of these standards, while dissipating only 4.5mA from a 1.2V supply.",

        "abstract": "Any around-the-body wireless system faces challenging requirements. This is especially true in the case of audio streaming around the head e.g. for wireless audio headsets or hearing-aid devices. The behind-the-ear device typically serves multiple radio links e.g. ear-to-ear, ear-to-pocket (a phone or MP3 player) or even a link between the ear and a remote base station such as a TV. Good audio quality is a prerequisite and mW-range power consumption is compulsory in view of battery size. However, the GHz communication channel typically shows a significant attenuation; for an ear-to-ear link, the attenuation due to the narrowband fade dominates and is in the order of 55 to 65dB [1]. The typically small antennas, close to the human body, add another 10 to 15dB of losses. For the ear-to-pocket and the ear-to-remote link, the losses due to body proximity and antenna size reduce, however the distance increases resulting in a similar link budget requirement of 80dB.",

Given a sub-mW power budget, many radios have utilized amplitude modulation and envelope detection to eliminate the need for accurate frequency references and to reduce power consumption [1-4]. However, such radios suffer from poor frequency selectivity. They rely on front-end filters to reject out-of-band interference, while in-band interferers still corrupt the desired signal.",

This amplification performance bottleneck has been highlighted in recent years by the disparity in achievable power efficiency between SAR ADCs versus ADC structures that require amplification [1]. In many analog and mixed-signal topics, a comparison like this doesn't even exist, simply because amplification is a necessity. Even SAR ADCs have their limitations, particularly at higher resolutions where matching and noise constraints begin to dominate capacitor sizing and comparator power requirements.",

        "abstract": "The opamps in a switched-capacitor (SC) pipelined ADC provide the functions of sample-and-hold, residue generation, and residue amplification [1,2]. High-performance opamps that meet the requirements for dc gain, speed, and signal range usually consume large power. We propose a scheme where the residue amplification is performed first by a coarse amplifier (CA), and then by a fine amplifier (FA). The CA generates a large-swing output that may not be accurate due to low dc gain and slow speed. Subsequently, the FA produces a small-swing output that stands as the error of the CA. The requirements for the CA and FA are different. They can be designed and optimized separately, resulting in low power dissipation. We report a 10b SC pipelined ADC to demonstrate this technique. Fabricated in 65nm CMOS, this ADC achieves 56.7dB SNDR at 200MS/s sampling rate, and consumes 5.37mW from a 1V supply.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, charge-redistribution SAR (Successive Approximation) ADCs have exhibited the highest conversion efficiencies for ADCs with moderate res olution and bandwidth. For effective resolutions beyond 10b or so, however, the accuracy of the SAR circuit blocks limits the overall energy efficiency of the converter. At high resolutions, for instance, the DAC voltages become small compared to the input-referred noise of a dynamic comparator, necessitating an additional power-hungry, low-noise pre-amplifier to drive the comparator. To improve the resolutions of SAR ADCs, this work introduces a technique to decouple the accuracy of the comparator from the resolution of the ADC. In this paper, we introduce a low-OSR (Oversampling Ratio) noise-shaping SAR ADC that leverages noise-shaping to increase the resolution of a conventional SAR ADC.",

        "abstract": "Applications like wireless sensor nodes require ultra-low-power ADCs. However, each application has different requirements for accuracy and bandwidth. Recent power-efficient ADCs for sensor applications are mostly designed for a fixed accuracy and a limited range of sample rates. An efficiently scalable sample rate (10kS/s to 10MS/s) has been demonstrated before, but without scalability of resolution. In, an ADC with both flexible resolution and sample rate is reported; however, its power efficiency is not as good as the point-solutions in. This paper describes a SAR ADC that achieves both good power efficiency (6.5-to-16fJ/conversion-step) and a wide range of flexibility (7-to-10b resolution, sample rates up to 4MS/s) to cover a large variety of applications, thereby reducing cost, design-time and overall complexity. To optimize the power efficiency for each resolution, both the DAC and comparator are reconfigurable. A 2-step conversion scheme is proposed for 9 and 10b settings to further reduce the power consumption. Finally, the use of an asynchronous architecture and dynamic circuitry ensures that the power consumption scales inherently proportional to the sample rate.",

        "abstract": "High-speed and low-power routers form the basic building blocks of on-die interconnect fabrics that are critical to overall throughput and energy efficiency of high performance systems. Conventional routers use distinct logic blocks for routing data and handling arbitration. At higher radices, connections between these blocks become a bottleneck, limiting router scalability and degrading performance. Recently, two switch topologies merged the data routing fabric with arbitration control, avoiding this bottleneck. However, relies on centralized control for channel allocation, limiting performance, while restricted to a small set of fixed priorities, rendering input ports prone to starvation. In addition, ever larger CMPs will require continued increases in bandwidth over previous designs. To address these issues, we present a 64x64 single-stage swizzle-switch network (SSN) with 128b data buses (8192 total input/output wires). The SSN can connect any input to any output, including multicast. It has a peak measured throughput of 4.5Tb/s at 1.1V in 45nm SOI CMOS at 25\u00b0C. The SSN's key features are: 1) a single-cycle least-recently granted (LRG) priority arbitration technique that reuses the already present input and output data buses and their drivers and sense amps; 2) an additional 4-level message-based priority arbitration for quality of service (QoS) with 2% logic and 3% wiring overhead; 3) a bidirectional bitline repeater that allows the router to scale to >;8000 wires. These features result in a compact fabric (4.06mm2) with throughput gain of 2.1 x over at 3.4Tb/s/W efficiency, which improves to 7.4Tb/s/W at 600mV.",

        "abstract": "Flip-flops (FFs) are key building blocks in the design of high-speed energy-efficient microprocessors, as their data-to-output delay (D-Q) and power dissipation strongly affect the processor's clock period and overall power. From pre vious analyses, the Transmission-Gate Pulsed Latch (TGPL) proved to be the most energy-efficient FF in a large portion of the design space, ranging from high speed (minimizing ED' products with j>;1) to minimum ED product designs, while simple Master-Slave FFs (TGFF and ACFF ) are the most energy-efficient in the low-power E-D space region. TGPL also has the lowest D Q delay along with STFF. However, the latter has considerably worse energy efficiency, hence, the TGPL is the best reference for a comparison. In this work, two new FFs are introduced, the Conditional Push-Pull Pulsed Latch (CP3L), and a version with a Shareable (CSP3L) Pulse Generator (PG). The adoption of a fast push-pull second stage, which requires a conditional PG, enables 50-to-100% delay improvements compared to TGPL, and absolute D-Q up to 0.7FO4. CP3L and CSP3L also exhibit superior energy efficiency to TGPL in terms of minimum ED3 and ED products. A test chip is fabricated in 65nm CMOS technology (VDD=1V) to measure delay and energy consumption of CP3L, CSP3L and TGPL in minimum ED and ED3 sizings. Different loadings are used in the mini mum ED (16\u03c7) and the minimum ED3 (64\u03c7) cases.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, subthreshold operation has become a research focus for digital systems with limited energy budget (e.g. mobile, battery-powered devices, radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor networks, or biomedical applications). Subthreshold operation allows for such low power consumption by reducing the supply voltage of the circuit below the threshold voltage of the transistors. As dynamic power depends quadratically on supply voltage, and static power depends exponentially on supply voltage, considerable power savings are achieved. At the same time propagation delays increase due to reduced transistor currents. Effectively, energy consumption per cycle can typically be reduced by a factor of 10 using subthreshold operation.",

        "abstract": "Scaling power supply voltages (VDD's) of logic circuits down to the sub/near-threshold region is a promising approach to achieve significant power reductions. Circuit delays in the ultra-low voltage region, however, are extremely sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, and hence, large timing margins are required for worst-case design. Since such large timing margins reduce the energy efficiency benefits of lower VDD, adaptive VDD control to cope with PVT variations is indispensable for ultra-low voltage circuits. In this paper, an adaptive VDD control system with parity-based error prediction and detection (PEPD) and 0.5-V input fully-integrated digital LDO (DLDO) is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Several methods that eliminate timing margins by detecting and correcting transient delay errors have been proposed. These Razor-style systems replace critical flip-flops with ones that detect late arriving signals, and use architectural replay to correct errors. However, none of these methods have been applied to a complete commercial processor due to their architectural invasiveness. In addition, these Razor techniques introduce significant hold time constraints that are difficult to meet given worsening timing variability. To address these two issues we propose Bubble Razor (B-Razor), which uses a novel error-detection technique based on two-phase latch timing and a local replay mechanism that can be inserted automatically in any design. The error detec tion technique breaks the dependency between minimum delay and speculation window, restoring hold-time constraints to conventional values and allowing timing speculation of up to 100% of nominal delay. The large timing specula tion makes Bubble Razor especially applicable to low-voltage designs where tim ing variation grows exponentially.",

        "abstract": "The vision of the Internet of Things with ambient intelligence calls for the deployment of up to a trillion connected wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). Minimizing the carbon footprint of each node is paramount from the sustainability perspective. In ultra-low-power applications, the life-cycle carbon footprint results from a complex balance between both embodied and use-phase energies [1]. The embodied energy arises mainly from CMOS chip manufacturing, and is essentially proportional to die area. Use-phase energy depends on both active and sleep-mode power, because of long stand-by periods in WSNs. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power 25MHz microcontroller SoC that fully exploits the versatility of a 65nm CMOS process with a low-power/general-purpose (LP/GP) transistor mix (dual-core oxide) to obtain: i) 7\u03bcW/MHz active power consumption due to a 0.4V ultra-low-voltage (ULV) thin-core-oxide (GP) CPU supplied by a 78%-efficiency embedded DC/DC converter; ii) 0.66mm2 die area for low embodied energy due to a compact converter design and a dual-VDD architecture, enabling the use of the foundry's 1V high-density 6T SRAM bitcell; and, iii) 1.5\u03bcW sleep-mode power due to body-biased sleep transistors embedded into the converter and thick-core-oxide (LP) MOSFETs for retentive SRAM and always-on peripherals (AOP). Moreover, an on-chip adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) system controlling the converter ensures safe 25MHz operation at ULV for all PVT conditions. A multi-Vt clock tree is also proposed to achieve reliable timing closure with low-power SoC features. Finally, a glitch-masking instruction cache (I$) is implemented to reduce the access power of the 1V program memory (PMEM).",

        "abstract": "Most of us dreamt about robots in our childhood interacting and assisting us in our daily life. They are way beyond fiction and have emerged to become unavoidable in minimally-invasive surgery and industrial automation. There is also an explosion in research areas around autonomous cars, humanoid/android, medical, mobile remote manipulation and personal assistance robots. Such advances largely benefit from to the advances in sensing, signal processing, analog/digital circuits, and devices in semiconductor technologies that are driven by consumer and automotive electronics. Increasingly robotic platforms are also benefiting from the wirelessly connected infrastructure and the cloud computing. Expansion of such applications is going to require more human-friendly and humanlike interactive systems. Improvements in energy efficiency, dependability, security, intelligent sensor networks are among technologies, which are expected from the next generation silicon system, that provide the means to the development of the next generation interactive robots. However, more closed collaboration of the hardware/software design, integration, and data fusion are also must. Robot developers' wish list for the semiconductor industry is endless and their creativ ity is admirable.",

They can often take a while to make their mark, as the conventional state of the art keeps moving, or there is resistance to change because of the exotic nature of the solution being offered, or the crossover condition in the market for the technology to be justified has not yet been reached. This session looks at a number of ideas that are currently asking us to re-assess the way things are done.

The continued scaling of information processing systems-on-a-chip using modern technology have made conventional electrical interconnects using copper the bottleneck for data traffic in many applications. Efforts in the area of optical backplane and technology have been underway for several years, generating significant interest due to its potential benefits in power, density and speed. Recently, these efforts have led to discussions regarding the role of embedded optics for chip to chip communication on printed circuit boards. Most signficantly, the advancement in silicon photonics compatible to CMOS technology have accelerated this discussion. A consensus appears to be emerging that PCB interconnects for mainframes and high-end servers will leverage optical technologies, but will these approaches ever go mainstream?",

        "abstract": "Television has been a major success for entertainment and gaming. TV has over 80 years of history since the original BBC broadcasts of 1929. It was thought that TV technology was almost mature with analog color TV and broadcasting by air. However, after introducing digital technology with high-speed IP-based networking, additional \"freedom\" to view content has been introduced. Users will experience this freedom through multiple devices and sources of content, and we expect that this will lead to drastically different behaviours when deciding what to watch. TV receiver equipment has also made great advances through the introduction of 3D imaging displays. However, it seems that this technology is still below acceptable levels for customers, because the gap between current TVs and customer demand is too large. More \"freedom\" is necessary to be introduced in display technology to meet users' expectations. The aim of this Evening Session is to discuss the technologies that are necessary to allow customers to enjoy future TV content from the viewpoints of service, platform, and device. Four speakers give talks from one of these viewpoints and discuss how high-performance and low-power digital technology will play an important role in the evolution of the TV.",

        "abstract": "Phased arrays exploit electronic beamforming to create an electronically steerable beam pattern. This renders antenna gain in certain directions and rejection in others, i.e. spatial filtering. Until recently, phased array systems exploited dedicated RF technologies leading to relatively costly systems, e.g. for nautical, airplane radar systems, and satellite communication. More recently, low-cost highly integrated beamforming concepts received considerable interest in academia but also industry, enabling consumer applications e.g. in base-stations for macro- and femto-cells, car-radar and 60GHz wideband radio links. (Bi-)CMOS beamforming techniques are at the heart of such systems. This forum reviews beamforming techniques suitable for IC-integration, and discusses related (Bi-)CMOS transceiver designs. Several techniques will be discussed, e.g. RF phase-shifting, LO-phase shifting, I/Q Vector modulation and digital processing. Also the relation between key radar and communication system requirements and transceiver-IC requirements will be considered. Finally, trends and challenges will be discussed in a panel.",

        "abstract": "In scaled VLSIs, a reliable robust circuit system is essential for the sustainable secure society. The threat to the VLSI system is caused by device, circuit or system issues. This forum provides an overview of the technical challenges as well as recent advances in circuit and system-level reliable VLSI technologies. The forum starts with the overview on the robustness and fault tolerance requirements for microcontrollers in automotive applications. The e-mobility and the new safety norm ISO 26262 affect future requirements on semiconductors. The second talk reviews recent trend of CMOS variability, followed by measured examples on static variations (process) as well as temporal variations (RTN, NBTI). Methods for variability characterization, minimization, and mitigation is also covered. The forum also has three presentations about reliable memory circuits. To enable high-density and low-power SRAMs with robust reliability and fault-tolerance, a variety of energy-efficient, variation-tolerant, and adaptive circuits are reviewed. Embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) has greatly contributed to the recent growth of MCU market. The current eNVM technologies for highly reliable applications and future directions such as STT-MRAM and ReRAM are presented. The increase of SSD storage capacity drastically increases the total amount of circuits in memory chips inside SSDs. High relaiable SSD controller technologies such as the block device (sector unit Read/Write device) management and the error correcting code are presented. Then, the robust system design is presented. New approaches to thorough test and validation that scale with tremendous growth in complexity and cost-effective tolerance and prediction of failures in hardware during system operation are discussed. The sevnth talk overviews the reliability measures and CMOS failure mechanisms for analog circuits. Simulation techniques to predict performance degradation or device failure is also presented. This forum also - ighlights the channel coding system which is essential for information transmission and storage. Complex systems for wireless communications require elaborate techniques like iterative (turbo) decoding or advanced algebraic code constructions and decoding algorithms. Finally, the robust energy management is presented for sensor systems and data servers. As a component of energy management, voltage regulators are providing utility beyond power conversion. How voltage regulators play an import role in energy efficient conversion as well as providing information that will help systems manage themselves for maximum utility is discussed.",

The objective of this forum is to present both electrical and optical I/O approaches to meeting these challenges at the architecture and circuit levels. This forum commences with two talks offering an overview of circuits and systems issues in CMOS technology. They are followed by two presentations focusing on the challenges of 20Gb/s+ over electrical backplanes and very lossy electrical channels. The next talk compares conventional analog equalization versus digital (data converter based) approaches from a system perspective. The final two talks focus on optical solutions, highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses of electrical and optical approaches. The forum concludes with a panel discussion providing the opportunity for participants to give feedback and ask questions.

        "abstract": "As performance scaling per core continues to slow-down, designers are faced with a myriad of challenges in efficiently using the transistors available in modern processes. This Forum will address these next generation computing challenges in the context of highly-parallel manycore processors. The key design challenge in this manycore era is management and efficient use of resources across the layers of design hierarchy to provide power efficient high performance. System design challenges and tradeoffs will be discussed for both high performance platforms as well as mobile platforms. This will be followed by a discussion on power optimization of manycore systems, on-chip communication fabrics, system-level power managment for real-time applications, power and performance modeling of manycore systems and a discussion on physical design challenges. The forum concludes with a panel discussion providing the opportunity for participants to give feedback and ask questions.",
